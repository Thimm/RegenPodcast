This episode has been sponsored by our generous patrons over on Patreon.com.  You can check that out at patreon.com forward slash red hills rancher or check out my link  
**[0:01:01-0:01:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:01:01):**  tree down in the show notes.  Last week I had a really great episode with Jared Lehman over on his podcast, Heard Quitter.  And I know that some of you folks are new here or some of you that are just joining  
**[0:01:12-0:01:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:01:12):**  us and haven't necessarily been through the whole back catalog.  I wrote down a few that I want to recommend.  So pause right here.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:01:18):**  Go get a pen.  Here's a few episodes that are kind of notable that are I feel a little bit underappreciated.  Episode five with Ariel Greenwood.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:01:28):**  That was an absolute blast to do.  That was one of the most memorable ones.  Ariel's a wonderful person to talk to.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:01:34):**  Episode eight with Beth Robinet was really good.  She's got a second generation holistic manager and she runs cowgirl camp.  That's pretty cool too.  
**[0:01:42-0:01:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:01:42):**  Episode 14 with the Hoy family was a lot of fun to do.  And when that episode aired, I was actually on their ranch on horseback learning about  IMG from them.  
**[0:01:51-0:02:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:01:51):**  So that was pretty cool.  We did a whole dairy mini series, episodes 19 through 22.  We talked about hand operated dairies, robot milking dairies, grass fed dairies and dairies  
**[0:02:02-0:02:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:02:02):**  that are still on the conventional side.  And then we tackled another topic in several episodes that's on a lot of people's minds  these days and that's succession.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:02:12):**  Episode seven and 26 with Dallas Mount, 24 with Jason Meadows and 32 with John Locke.  I think all are worth the time it'll take you to listen.  That's enough of that.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:02:21):**  Here we go with this week's guest, Jared Lehman, host of the Herdquitter podcast joins  me on Zoom.  Jared, welcome to Ranching Reboot.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:02:29):**  How are you today?  Hey, Brian.  Thanks.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:02:32):**  Thanks.  I'm doing well.  I am happy to be in the house.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:02:35):**  It got a little colder today after it was being 45 degrees yesterday.  So I'm enjoying a day in the office, which is nice because it dropped back down to mid-teens  I think.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:02:46):**  Just before I set down to do this, I went outside and I walked around a little bit,  you know, just let moving because you know, we're going to be sitting here for a little  while.  
**[0:02:53-0:03:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:02:53):**  Yeah.  And it's 72 degrees.  There's just a nice breeze.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:03:00):**  Sun is out, birds are singing.  It's a beautiful day.  In 24 hours, it's going to be 50 degrees cooler.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:03:07):**  Wow.  Wow.  50 degrees cooler.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:03:10):**  Okay, that's, yeah, that's a bit of a drop.  I think we're looking at 20 or 30 degrees warmer or cooler than it was yesterday.  But that's, that's enough.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:03:18):**  I mean, I, it's right at this time of year where it's like, you can start to point towards  spring, but you're not quite going to get too excited when it warms up a little bit  because there's still a long time that could definitely get pretty nasty.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:03:30):**  So I'm not getting my hopes up too much when we had a 44 degree day yesterday, but it was  just it felt like spring and it was pretty nice.  Down here in southern Kansas, generally, we get to the end of February.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:03:41):**  That's the that's the last of your cold weather in.  Like, according to the National Weather Service, we got about 90 hours of cold coming up like  a below freezing, which that's tolerable.  
**[0:03:53-0:04:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:03:53):**  We can deal with that.  But hopefully that should be the last cold blast we've got to deal with.  And as we get through March, we'll get a couple wild storms first part of March.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:04:03):**  Then somewhere around there, I'll release this episode.  And hopefully we'll just get some good rains and yeah.  Yeah.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:04:10):**  So this may be a dumb question.  I should maybe know.  If you're kind of marches already where it starts to get bad.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:04:16):**  When do people start?  When do things start greening up?  When do people start planting things like in your area?  
**[0:04:21-0:04:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:04:21):**  Well, I'm not much of a farmer.  So I'm kind of the the terrible guy to ask.  We've already been started a bunch of our seeds indoors, like for early crop, you know,  
**[0:04:31-0:04:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:04:31):**  early cool season garden crops, things like that, like onions, broccolis, things of that  nature.  But as far as the farmers around here, just north, I mean, there's a lot of irrigation  
**[0:04:42-0:04:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:04:42):**  and they're gonna probably first two weeks of April or whenever the Almanac tells them  the last freeze gone, they're gonna they're gonna start putting the corns in the beans  in the dirt.  
**[0:04:54-0:05:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:04:54):**  Wheat harvest, it's planted in the fall here grows all winter generally harvested early  June late May is about when harvest when grain harvest starts down.  Every once in a while you get a couple of weirdos do some double crop milo.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:05:10):**  Sometimes that fits in and cotton start to be big and and feed starting to be big, but  that's all you know, growing season stuff.  Sure.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:05:18):**  Yeah.  And your grass is most mostly green lighter warm season grasses, right?  So that probably is later in the season when it really starts going or  
**[0:05:26-0:05:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:05:26):**  warm season grass is really gonna make up the bulk of my pastures.  But it needs a cool season grasses and I need the Forbes to provide you know, a lot of that  nutritional punch that that the warm season grasses can't always provide, you know, everything  
**[0:05:42-0:05:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:05:42):**  is great to eat in the pasture for a couple of days.  Right?  Yeah.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:05:48):**  Everything just demands to be eaten.  And for a very short window and you know, finding those pastures that have a lot of  that stuff and making sure the cows are there when that stuff should be palatable.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:05:58):**  Sometimes it can be a challenge.  But sure.  Yeah, that wasn't your question.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:06:02):**  No, no.  That's it's interesting.  I just, we talked about whether it blows my mind that you were 70 degrees here today.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:06:10):**  But I forget, you know, yeah, totally different world.  So it's 30 when I left the house and I was in a hoodie and by the time I got done checking  water and checking cows and, you know, just checking on everything.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:06:20):**  It was it was 6969 eight or nine and I was about ready to shed the hoodie and turn the  air conditioner on.  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:06:28):**  Yeah.  It's that's always cool.  I love in the spring when you get outside and it's like, yeah, it's weird in the spring  
**[0:06:33-0:06:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:06:33):**  when it's 65 degrees, you feel like you could be in shorts and t shirt fall when it gets  to 65 degrees.  It's like bundled up in a where's my snow suit bibs and yeah, yeah.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:06:44):**  Exactly.  Yeah.  So where are you?  
**[0:06:47-0:06:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:06:47):**  Yeah, yeah, I'm located in southeast Minnesota.  So the town is good here.  And it's right in between the Twin Cities and Rochester, which nobody ever knows where  
**[0:06:57-0:07:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:06:57):**  good here is.  And if they've heard of good here, it's also in good you County.  So they always ask where in good who are you?  
**[0:07:02-0:07:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:07:02):**  Like, good.  You know, like, yeah, but where?  So yeah, good to town.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:07:08):**  Good to township.  Good.  You town good.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:07:11):**  You County.  Southeast Minnesota.  Okay, yeah, I've actually I've never visited Minnesota.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:07:16):**  The closest I've been would have been probably 25 years ago.  I was over 25 years ago.  I went went up to see some family when they had a place at Dore County, Wisconsin.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:07:29):**  I would imagine that it's 100% not like that where you are.  Yeah, it's probably a little different than Wisconsin.  They've got little different terrains.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:07:39):**  We're we're in like kind of just rolling hills.  Pretty darn productive ground.  It's mostly crop country around me everything if I look out is almost entirely corn and  
**[0:07:49-0:08:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:07:49):**  soybeans and if there's something green, it's alfalfa and it's fed to dairy cows kind of  just alfalfa hay.  But yeah, not many people do get up here and the invitation is open to you.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:08:00):**  But I always invite people say if you're ever in Minnesota, swing by but nobody's ever in  Minnesota.  If they are, if they are there at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, and they're not in a visiting  
**[0:08:09-0:08:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:08:09):**  mood.  So  it's kind of like here I always invite people Yeah, if you're ever in a neighborhood come  
**[0:08:14-0:08:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:08:14):**  by and see me the trouble is, my neighborhood is so far off the beaten track.  The only way to get here is if you're actually going here, like not people actually just  accidentally happened to be passing by.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:08:26):**  Yeah, yeah, no, that's that's the way it is here.  But I don't know one of these days, somebody will be like, I happen to go into Minnesota  and I'll be like blown away.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:08:35):**  But there Yeah, that's not really a destination.  And I shouldn't say that because there are some beautiful places in Minnesota, especially  when you get up north, you got the boundary waters.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:08:44):**  And I've never actually been there myself some of the more unique things in Minnesota.  I haven't strayed too far from home for the most part.  So but would like to for sure.  
**[0:08:54-0:08:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:08:54):**  I can appreciate that.  There's a lot of cool things in Kansas.  I haven't had the opportunity to see.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:08:59):**  Yeah, someday, we'll get out.  We'll get around.  But we'll get there.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:09:05):**  So tell me about Jared.  Did you?  Did you grow up there in Minnesota in southeast Minnesota?  
**[0:09:10-0:09:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:09:10):**  Yeah, so right now I'm sitting in my office.  That's the home farm that my grandpa had purchased in the 90s.  And if it's kind of hard to describe, I guess here, but the house I grew up in is about  
**[0:09:24-0:09:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:09:24):**  just up the road.  And there's kind of a diagonal line, about a half a mile piece where I grew up in that  house.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:09:30):**  My dad grew up in the house I'm in now, you go half a mile straight.  Southwest was the house my grandpa grew up in another house just on the way is the house  his father grew up in.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:09:41):**  So the lumens have been here for I don't even know how long we're bad at some of that family  history stuff.  They've been here for well over a century and my brother's family, or my grandpa's brother's  
**[0:09:51-0:10:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:09:51):**  family runs the original homestead, the century farm and we're on the farm my grandpa bought  in the 1960s.  And yeah, I guess I've always grown up in this area, but and we can get into it whenever  
**[0:10:05-0:10:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:10:05):**  later or something too.  But my dad actually started grazing dairy about three or four miles down the road.  And I grew up there till I was eight years old.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:10:12):**  And then we moved back here to the home farm in the year 2000 or so.  What's that?  Is he still doing the grazing dairy?  
**[0:10:19-0:10:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:10:19):**  No, no.  So he, he did that when when he got home from school, there wasn't really room to come home  to the home farm.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:10:28):**  And it's kind of how we got into grazing was, and I guess we'll go way back.  My grandfather and his brother farm together, and they were for the time and like the 60s,  70s, 80s, pretty progressive farmers in like the 70s.  
**[0:10:43-0:10:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:10:43):**  They were milking close to 200 beef dairy cows had like 100 to 150 beef cows and a few  hundred sheep and they were farming like 1000 acres, which is pretty big in this area, but  it was very much conventional commodity agriculture.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:10:58):**  And we had a foreign exchange student, a lot of foreign exchange student labor to keep  all those operations going.  And a guy Ed Bizet, who was from New Zealand was one of our foreign exchange exchange students  
**[0:11:13-0:11:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:11:13):**  and wasn't afraid to tell my grandpa, he said, you guys are 15 years behind everything we're  doing over there in New Zealand, you got it all wrong.  What are you doing?  
**[0:11:21-0:11:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:11:21):**  You're working so hard.  What is, you know, just kind of told him how it was.  And my grandpa, you know, was smart enough to not take offense to that, but say maybe  
**[0:11:28-0:11:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:11:28):**  there's something to this and kind of encouraged my dad to go over to New Zealand and figure  out what, what he was talking about.  And so my dad went over to New Zealand and spent eight months or so they're working on  
**[0:11:40-0:11:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:11:40):**  a dairy, a grazing dairy, and then a beef, sheep and deer station actually.  And so then he came back and my grandpa wasn't, you know, there wasn't really room on the  home farm.  
**[0:11:53-0:12:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:11:53):**  They had actually in the late eighties split my grandpa and his brother.  So they weren't daring anymore.  And my grandpa was just kind of conventional beef and crops.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:12:02):**  And so my dad started bought this dairy down the road, started his own grazing dairy.  And then in the early, like in year 2000, my grandpa was ready to kind of back out  of the management of the farm.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:12:11):**  And so dad sold the dairy and moved back to the home farm.  So kind of a roundabout way of answering your question.  Does he still dairy?  
**[0:12:19-0:12:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:12:19):**  No, no, he doesn't.  Okay.  Okay.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:12:23):**  Yeah.  So back to your story.  Yeah.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:12:26):**  How's your, how's she grew up in like, I'm living in the house that I was conceived in  basically.  Sure.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:12:33):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  So I grew up there three miles down the road at the dairy.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:12:38):**  The time when we sold that, well, I remember bouncing in the back of the five Wheeler up  and down this rocky Hill and bringing cattle down and watching dad kind of do a little  bit of grazing management and stuff there.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:12:49):**  I didn't really know what was happening, but he moved to the home farm here when I was  an eight.  And it's, it's literally the house right up the road.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:12:58):**  It's a quarter mile up the road from the farm driveway, which is where I live now.  I live where my grandpa lived and so I grew up there.  I had two brothers, neither of them really ever showed much interest in the farm.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:13:13):**  They one would help when we needed it, like needed it, but no more.  The other would help a little more often when dad asked, but wasn't really interested in.  And then myself, I, I always love the farm, although it's kind of funny growing up.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:13:26):**  I hated the cattle and hated the livestock.  In the early two thousands, we dad actually jumped into sheep and got a few hundred use  and hated the sheep, hated the beef cattle.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:13:37):**  I just wanted to sit in the tractor and drive.  I wanted to make hay.  I love hanging, love crop farming, that stuff.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:13:47):**  And that's what I thought I would do, but I knew we were never really big enough to  make a living doing conventional cropping.  And, and, and, and cattle was a big part.  
**[0:13:56-0:14:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:13:56):**  And so we raised organic crops and cattle was a big part of that.  The rotation.  And so I bought some cows of my own and in the process of buying and managing some of  
**[0:14:06-0:14:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:14:06):**  my own cows, I kind of fell in love with the cattle side of it.  So how were the cows part of the organic farming operation?  Yeah.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:14:15):**  Yeah.  So with organic crops, I mean, there's a few main challenges.  One is weed pressure.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:14:22):**  We have a lot of moisture and every new rainfall, you get a lot of new flush of weeds and a  lot of weed pressure here.  And so to kind of part of the way of helping control weeds is to break up years out of  
**[0:14:35-0:14:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:14:35):**  crop production into some sort of a forage, either a hay or a pasture mix.  And that kind of just sets back and kind of delays.  It kind of just seems to set back weed pressure and stuff.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:14:46):**  So we would rotate a corn beans and then into some sort of a perennial for two to four years  and then kind of back into crops.  And so cattle were kind of gave us some sort of a way to generate income off of those off  
**[0:14:59-0:15:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:14:59):**  crop years.  And the other big challenge in addition to weed control is fertility.  And so by having livestock on the farm, you can have access to manure and kind of utilize  
**[0:15:11-0:15:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:15:11):**  some of that, although we did still import some extra manure and stuff too.  But that was probably, yeah, the big part was that rotation, getting it out of crop  production for a couple of years at a time.  
**[0:15:23-0:15:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:15:23):**  Importing manure is probably a smarter idea than importing liquid nitrogen.  And you're touching on something that, you know, it's pretty important to not overlook  is what cattle can provide in terms of fertility for the big three nutrients, nitrogen, potassium,  
**[0:15:42-0:15:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:15:42):**  phosphorus, and carbon just by having their presence out on the landscape.  My friend, Macaulay Kincaid helped me with some numbers a couple of years ago.  I went through and grabbed a couple of different dairy studies from land grant universities  
**[0:15:57-0:16:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:15:57):**  about what manure, how it broke down, like nitrogen, carbon, potassium, and what was  what, and what fertility effect that had when it was applied on a field.  Now, granted, they were kind of taking your typical dairy situation where you've got a  
**[0:16:12-0:16:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:16:12):**  big liquid pit where everything goes, which we can both agree that's not how things work  in the real world.  But I think some of the math carries over as far as the actual volumes of NPK and carbon  
**[0:16:23-0:16:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:16:23):**  that are getting transported back out.  So the calculations that I came to, if you had a paddock stocked at approximately 50,000  pounds per acre of cows for 24 hours, you're going to add about $50 worth of synthetic  
**[0:16:42-0:16:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:16:42):**  fertility to that pasture.  Now, granted, these are all pre-COVID costs.  These numbers are two, three years old.  
**[0:16:52-0:17:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:16:52):**  So they're kind of pre-COVID.  You can imagine how all that's totaling up the value.  So you were calculating the total NPK that you got out of the manure that those cattle  
**[0:17:04-0:17:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:17:04):**  deposited and equating it to a value based on synthetic fertilizers is what you're saying  you were doing?  Right.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:17:10):**  Right.  So if you had this much NPK carbon from the cows, what would it cost to bring the equivalent  quantity of synthetic fertilizer and apply it?  
**[0:17:22-0:17:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:17:22):**  And the cost was, I mean, it was 50 plus acre.  That's cool.  The fertility is definitely worth something.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:17:32):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  And for sure we saw that.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:17:35):**  And it was neat because I remember one year in particular, we had this field that was  just up the way and it had been in pasture for eight years, 10 years, significantly longer  than the average rotation.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:17:48):**  And it was weed when we put it back into crops, which now I talk about this and it makes me  sad to think of taking this eight or 10 year established pasture and tilling it up and  putting it back into crops.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:17:58):**  So it's hard to even think about that, but we did.  And it was the highest yielding field.  We had a custom combiner come out and said, this should be on the cover of organic magazine  
**[0:18:09-0:18:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:18:09):**  or whatever.  He said, he was weed free, extremely high yielding stuff.  And so you're right.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:18:13):**  It was neat to see that the impact that grazing for many years can have on productivity.  Not that you now, like I say, it makes me sad to think about just tearing it all up  and wasting that just to go back and get some good yielding corn.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:18:29):**  But it was cool to see.  But it was informational and educational.  I mean, you learn something.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:18:36):**  Yeah, yeah, for sure.  And I mean, it's kind of a challenge in our area.  I grew up being told you need to farm, you need 1000 acres per full time family member  
**[0:18:50-0:19:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:18:50):**  to farm here.  And now we're running like 700 acres.  You know, back then we were 500 acres or so and we had myself and my dad and for a while,  
**[0:19:01-0:19:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:19:01):**  my grandpa as well, two to three generations farming and running, trying to make a living  off of this farm.  And so organic crops has always been a big part of our businesses financial viability  
**[0:19:14-0:19:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:19:14):**  because organic crop production is quite lucrative.  Premium.  Yeah, it's a premium product and it generates a pretty good premium or profit per acre.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:19:24):**  And so that's been a big part of our farm story and getting us to where we are today.  And stuff.  So you know, we look back at it, you know, as we've learned more about and we still do  
**[0:19:35-0:19:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:19:35):**  some we've been moving more and more towards pasture.  But we still do some.  But looking back at it as we learn more and more about soil health.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:19:44):**  And we're not sure how much progress we made, if any of the soil and we were doing it as  best as we could as far as organic cropping, trying to build soils, we were doing it as  best we could, but it's still we're not sure how much progress we made.  
**[0:19:57-0:20:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:19:57):**  But it was a big part of our financial, you know, kind of thing in a holistic context  anyway when we're considering soil health and financial viability and lifestyle.  It was a big part of that financial piece.  
**[0:20:10-0:20:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:20:10):**  I would argue you were improving the soil health.  And maybe, oh, gosh, I just painted myself into a corner.  You proved by an experiment by an extractive experiment of corn, that the high density  
**[0:20:30-0:20:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:20:30):**  grazing and establishing a perennial pasture, and then breaking it back out for a crop.  You've proved that that works.  You it's a low cost way to add fertility.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:20:40):**  It's a it's a way to get a really great crop.  It just requires more creativity and more management.  And I don't think that's a bad thing.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:20:47):**  Yeah, yeah.  It's a good point.  I don't know if we did a huge amount of destruction or anything and stuff, but I do think, you  
**[0:20:55-0:21:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:20:55):**  know, the way we managed it did definitely probably make some improvements to and I had  a conversation with Lance Gunderson.  He's the yeah, yeah, he's in Nebraska there.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:21:08):**  What is Regen Labs?  Regen Ag Labs, something like that.  Regen Ag Labs, yeah.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:21:12):**  Yeah.  He was kind of talking about the destruction or the destructivity.  I don't even know the word, the destructiveness of tillage.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:21:22):**  And he kind of talked about, you know, yeah, it's not great.  And if you can avoid it, great.  That's that's fantastic.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:21:28):**  But when you really think about the ability of biology and a healthy functioning system  to recover from tillage, it can do it pretty quickly.  He talked about and, and so we wanted to minimize tillage as much as possible.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:21:42):**  And there's guys doing it where there's very little tillage.  And we probably did it more than we should.  And we hadn't figured it out as well as some folks do.  
**[0:21:51-0:22:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:21:51):**  But even if you have to for weed control or something, use a little bit of tillage occasionally.  He wasn't too, he thought that might be better than, for example, a no till heavy chemical  and synthetic system that you know, it's so it's, I don't know, in a world where it's  
**[0:22:09-0:22:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:22:09):**  pretty tough to have perfection.  I mean, in an ideal world, it's a perennial pasture mix and grazing and stuff.  But the challenge with that up here is winter, we can't crazy around and that gets really  
**[0:22:20-0:22:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:22:20):**  expensive to feed cattle through the winter.  So there's  you can't even stockpile forage into pasture for them.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:22:29):**  We can and we have we the most most years the issue is that the snow falls and it kind  of we have a couple warm days and then it freezes and it kind of ice is over.  And that's not ideal for cows trying to find groceries.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:22:45):**  It's not.  It's not.  It's been a struggle.  
**[0:22:48-0:23:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:22:48):**  We've for the last kind of six or seven years now, since I got more involved and got home  on the farm and stuff.  We've been really trying to figure out how do we graze later we dad and I went and did  
**[0:23:01-0:23:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:23:01):**  the numbers on what it actually cost us to feed hay.  And I'm like, embarrassed almost to say this, like what our costs were, because it was so  not sustainable, like, you don't have to say it didn't even do it.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:23:12):**  I mean, it was it was just a not sustainable price that we were paying when you include  when we especially when you include opportunity costs, we were feeding what was really good  high quality organic alfalfa hay that we could have sold to an organic dairy for 200 250  
**[0:23:27-0:23:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:23:27):**  bucks a ton to beef cows.  And feed, you know, so I mean, it worked out to several dollars per day.  And we're like, well, gosh, we just need to reduce our winter feed costs.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:23:37):**  We need to do this.  And so we started with a lot of sorghum sedan plantings is the big kind of thing we did  and and even that got buried under snow and ice were in the if we grazed it August, September,  
**[0:23:51-0:24:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:23:51):**  November, even in December, we were getting 180 plus cow days per acre out of the sorghum.  And when it got buried under snow in February, we were getting 30 cow days per acre and the  rest they couldn't access and they were going backwards and body condition pretty quick.  
**[0:24:05-0:24:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:24:05):**  And so when you have 200 to $300 an acre land rent tied up and something that gets you $30  30 cow days per acre.  It just is a that's pretty expensive too.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:24:15):**  And so for winter, we've kind of actually gone to a couple things grazing corn, corn  stocks is the main one and we send send our corn our cows are actually down in southeast  Nebraska grazing corn stocks down there.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:24:30):**  And our yearlings are grazing, they've grazed corn stocks 10 miles away and the last three  years we've gotten till January 20, or later, grazing corn stocks up here.  So if that I don't know if that's consistent, that's three years in a row of trials that  
**[0:24:44-0:24:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:24:44):**  we've been able to get that late.  But it's way better than most folks starting to feed and end of October.  Are you still so when they're out on stocks, you're still having to feed right?  
**[0:24:57-0:25:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:24:57):**  No, they're just grazing straight stocks.  No hay, no protein, nothing.  They just salt and mineral grazing stocks through snow and ice as deep as they are as  
**[0:25:05-0:25:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:25:05):**  long as they can.  And yeah, yeah, that's that.  It's the best we can do to push them hard.  
**[0:25:10-0:25:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:25:10):**  Yeah, we've been trying to breed the tough ones.  So  breed the tough ones.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:25:15):**  So I want to get we'll circle back to that.  I still haven't finished hearing the story of how Jared came to the farm.  Sure.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:25:23):**  The ranch.  Yeah.  Okay.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:25:26):**  All right.  So gosh, we're well, I was Yeah, so as a kid, I was always the one that wanted to  help on the farm.  
**[0:25:34-0:25:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:25:34):**  For sure.  Spent most every day after school and summers, all summer out working.  My brother's had off farm jobs.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:25:42):**  And I think it was probably a blessing for some reason when I got my driver's license,  even though there was plenty of work to do on the farm, I applied at 11 different places  and not one called me back.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:25:50):**  So I have a feeling my dad called them all and said, you better not hire my son because  I need him here or something.  But I didn't get a job and I ended up just working on the farm.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:25:59):**  And then went to school at the University of Minnesota.  In the summers, I had summer internships, but close to home so I could farm and weekends  and I would come home and farm from school and stuff.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:26:12):**  So I was always pretty involved, but graduated and came right home.  Just when I graduated came right back, which I still am not sure if that was the best thing  or not, you know, my dad had that opportunity to go to New Zealand.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:26:23):**  And I was wondering if I maybe missed out on that opportunity.  And so actually in 2020, when we kind of were deciding to more actively switch out of cropping  towards more pasture, we realized it really doesn't take any more labor to move 250 cows  
**[0:26:39-0:26:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:26:39):**  than it did 150 cows.  And we have a lot less cropping to do and dad wasn't going to leave.  So I actually took a job working for the Sustainable Farming Association as well.  
**[0:26:48-0:27:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:26:48):**  So I still farm after work and weekends and stuff.  But that's been kind of my New Zealand trip is it's been a fantastic opportunity to go  out and meet farmers all around the state and learn how other people are doing things.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:27:01):**  And yeah, that's been good.  But yeah, went to school and came right home after I graduated.  Nobody's gonna judge you for sitting in a tractor.  
**[0:27:11-0:27:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:27:11):**  Nobody's gonna judge you for farming.  Yeah, yeah.  No, I mean, it's not even that it's bad.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:27:17):**  We both prefer cattle now.  And it's weird because I like I said, growing up, I love sitting in the tractor listening  to the radio.  
**[0:27:23-0:27:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:27:23):**  Now it bores me to death.  Like I all I want to do is be out moving cattle and you know, cattle with the out in the pasture  with cows and stuff.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:27:32):**  That's what we both enjoy.  Neither of us are mechanical and probably part of the thing that changed when I came  home.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:27:38):**  It was nice when I was in high school, if something broke down, I'd be like, Hey, Dad,  call him up, you know, hey, Dad, tractor broke.  I'm gonna head into town with the guys.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:27:47):**  Let me know when it's ready and I'll come back and plant or whatever, you know.  And today, hey, Dad, something broke.  He's like, All right, well, I'm overdoing this.  
**[0:27:55-0:27:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:27:55):**  You better figure it out.  Let me know when you got it fixed.  It's like, huh?  
**[0:27:58-0:28:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:27:58):**  This way to go the other way.  And it's dad being like, Oh, hey, this broke.  I don't know what happened.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:28:04):**  I'm gonna Yeah.  Good luck.  That has that's happened as well.  
**[0:28:09-0:28:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:28:09):**  Yeah, no doubt.  Get used to that.  Yeah.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:28:14):**  I have no problem with farmers by no means.  I'm surrounded by almost all of my friends here are regular crop farmers.  I think there's even ways to really build soil in crop farming.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:28:25):**  I've seen people do amazing things with cover crops and just corn and soybeans, but adding  cover crops and no till in the right ways.  It's tremendous what people can do.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:28:35):**  So I have nothing against farming.  I just realized that's not really what I want to do.  Yeah.  
**[0:28:40-0:28:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:28:40):**  And you know, that kind of brings to mind a lot of the things that I say on this podcast  and that, you know, some of my guests talk about make it sound like we're really negative  on commodity crop farming.  
**[0:28:51-0:29:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:28:51):**  Well, we kind of are, but there's still a place for it.  I mean, the soils that are just north of me, where it gets into irrigated country, that  goes through most of Kansas and up into Nebraska and west into Colorado down through the panhandles.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:29:10):**  There is so much potential to heal so many acres of soil that have been degraded by this  model culture agriculture.  It's like, you know, there's a lot of programs, you know, government programs and like, the  
**[0:29:27-0:29:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:29:27):**  one I'm thinking of is a lesser prairie chicken habitat conservation.  And there's a bunch of wind farms north of me.  They had to build a bunch of big power lines to get the power out.  
**[0:29:40-0:29:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:29:40):**  And this is 14 years ago, the guy was coming out to cite the power lines.  And he's like, well, we don't want to put them through the farm ground because that's  going to interrupt the farmers.  
**[0:29:50-0:29:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:29:50):**  And that'll be in the way of the wind turbines.  We want to put them out here through this place.  And we're like, well, hold up.  
**[0:29:55-0:30:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:29:55):**  You know, this is critical prairie chicken habitat.  It's like some of the last.  And we got him to agree like to designate it as a listed bird that since come off.  
**[0:30:07-0:30:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:30:07):**  But the good part was they moved the power line.  I mean, it's not on the ranch.  I can still see it from the house.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:30:13):**  I can see it ranch, but the whole Ridge north of me and I can see probably 40 miles of it  stretching across the horizon.  It's just wind turbines.  
**[0:30:24-0:30:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:30:24):**  100% wind turbines.  And we don't have any down here and I'm kind of grateful for it because yeah.  And where it was leading to with that is we have this wonderful bird, the lesser prairie  
**[0:30:38-0:30:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:30:38):**  chicken, and it's really an amazing bird.  I mean, native prairie grouse to this part of the world.  And we've pushed it into this marginal, you know, in this incredibly marginal habitat.  
**[0:30:51-0:31:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:30:51):**  I mean, I'll admit that right now.  My ranch is and always has been marginal habitat for that bird.  The big, flat open farm, the big open areas that are up north, I mean, that are currently  
**[0:31:05-0:31:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:31:05):**  under either a two or three crop oscillation or rotation, or growing the most soil destructive  crop that can be possibly planted here.  That's where all the prime prairie chicken habitat is.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:31:18):**  That's where all the prime prairie chicken habitat is.  Why is your habitat not prairie chicken habitat, but up there it's like, what's the difference  in?  
**[0:31:27-0:31:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:31:27):**  They like big, flat open spaces where they can see forever.  They don't like the canyons and the brush where the coyotes can sneak up on them.  Sure.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:31:35):**  They like to have a big open area that's kind of grazed a little bit flat to do their  mating dance called booming.  It's pretty cool.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:31:45):**  Like native American tribes, like have prairie chicken dance that's modeled after the actual  prairie chicken dance.  So that's pretty neat.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:31:57):**  But then they also need some tallish cover nearby.  They need a varied amount of habitat.  Like you see in the picture behind me, grasses under my cow's bellies.  
**[0:32:10-0:32:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:32:10):**  It's a nesting habitat, but it's not always good feeding or breeding habitat.  So you have to have kind of a good, you have to have the right amount of habitat is what  I'm saying.  
**[0:32:19-0:32:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:32:19):**  That makes sense.  Because that's when I see what's behind you.  Like, obviously, nobody listening can see what's behind you.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:32:23):**  I imagine when I see that it looks like beautiful, some sort of bird habitat kind of cover from  wildlife protection and stuff.  That's what I would imagine.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:32:30):**  But I've never been a wildlife expert by any means.  I guess I'm not a wildlife expert in the sense that I just observed wildlife constantly when  I'm out on the ranch and occasionally visit with a couple people that are a lot smarter  
**[0:32:46-0:32:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:32:46):**  than me.  But speaking of what's going on in the video, if you want to see the video, what we're actually  talking about in our backgrounds, you're gonna have to go to my Patreon and sign up for Patreon  
**[0:32:57-0:33:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:32:57):**  to get the unedited versions of the videos.  So I didn't know we were on video.  That was a good that's good to know.  
**[0:33:03-0:33:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:33:03):**  I didn't really I would have I don't know, worn a nicer shirt or something.  Oh, you're fine.  You're fine.  
**[0:33:10-0:33:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:33:10):**  They come here for the content.  Not not how pretty.  That's good.  
**[0:33:13-0:33:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:33:13):**  Sure.  If they came here for how pretty I am, I would have zero fans like that beard.  That's what they're coming to see.  
**[0:33:20-0:33:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:33:20):**  Yeah.  Beautiful.  Yeah.  
**[0:33:23-0:33:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:33:23):**  Okay, so circling back, you're you're back on the farm.  But what year was that?  That you came back to the farm?  
**[0:33:29-0:33:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:33:29):**  You said just a couple years ago?  It's spring of 2015.  I got back.  
**[0:33:33-0:33:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:33:33):**  I graduated college.  Yeah, spring of 2015.  Okay, what the operation look like then versus what it looks like now?  
**[0:33:41-0:34:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:33:41):**  Yeah, so at that time, we had just picked up another farm.  We were running about 600 acres and probably 250 to 350 somewhere in their acres of row  crops a year, probably 300 250 to 300 acres of row crops a year of organic corn, sweet  
**[0:34:02-0:34:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:34:02):**  corn, field corn, sweet corn, black edible beans and soybeans are the main crops that  we raise and stuff and the rest was either alfalfa hay kind of in the rotation or perennial  pastures.  
**[0:34:13-0:34:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:34:13):**  We had really just two farms that we could graze on.  One was the home farm and a farm that we picked up in 2014 that we had just put fence around  and the other farms we rented two other farms that were they didn't have fence didn't have  
**[0:34:27-0:34:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:34:27):**  water infrastructure, nothing like that.  And so yeah, the cropping was big part of it.  And we were still kind of at that time, had really no intentions of changing out of the  
**[0:34:39-0:34:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:34:39):**  cropping system.  It was big part of it.  It was, but within a couple of years, actually that fall of 2015 that I graduated, my grandpa  
**[0:34:48-0:35:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:34:48):**  he was still up until that point, day, every day, sunup till sundown out there working.  And so we had three of us and the workload was high and we had enough people and up until,  and then that fall of 2015, my grandpa had a stroke and he moved into town to an assisted  
**[0:35:04-0:35:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:35:04):**  living home and stuff.  And at that point, the following that fall and the following summer things, I mean, it  was exhausting, just dad and me doing all this and we were working like crazy.  
**[0:35:16-0:35:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:35:16):**  And that's the way my grandpa and my dad had grown up and I had grown up that way too.  And I knew that, but I also knew that I didn't want that to be my life either.  And so we kind of realized we wanted something to change lifestyle wise in addition to the  
**[0:35:32-0:35:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:35:32):**  soil health.  And when I got home, I went to everything that I could get to as far as conferences  and conventions and things to learn.  
**[0:35:39-0:35:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:35:39):**  And so soil health was something I was learning a lot about and just seemed to make sense  that we needed to change something.  Who's your favorite soil health guru?  
**[0:35:51-0:36:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:35:51):**  Oh gosh, that's a good question.  Looking over at my bookshelf for help.  Dirt to Soil is always my favorite book, Gay Brown, my favorite book until I read the Turnaround  
**[0:36:03-0:36:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:36:03):**  actually by Dave Pratt, the book they send out with the school that shall not be named,  I believe is what you refer to it as.  But not even get the button.  
**[0:36:14-0:36:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:36:14):**  I was already.  Oh, well, I apologize for that.  You got a beeper or something like that or a ding, a bell?  
**[0:36:21-0:36:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:36:21):**  Yeah, for the ranching for profit school.  There we go.  Nice.  
**[0:36:26-0:36:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:36:26):**  That's great.  Yeah, that book is now my new favorite, but the Gay Brown's book and what he's done  in his ranch in North Dakota is so cool.  
**[0:36:38-0:36:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:36:38):**  And it always, while it's a totally different environment, it was cool in that it was both  crops and livestock.  It wasn't just a grazing story and it wasn't just a cropping story.  
**[0:36:47-0:37:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:36:47):**  It was similar to our story and that it had both and that he used them, integrated them.  So that was kind of relevant and spoke to me, I guess, more than some stories, people  who are all one and that's just not our context.  
**[0:37:01-0:37:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:37:01):**  But no, he was a big one for sure.  For sure.  Yeah.  
**[0:37:07-0:37:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:37:07):**  And Jason Rountree actually that fall, my mom's family is from Michigan.  And so my dad sent me, he told me the Grass-fed Exchange is having a conference out in Michigan  at Michigan State University.  
**[0:37:18-0:37:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:37:18):**  And so I went out there and stayed with my grandpa out there and went to the Grass-fed  Exchange that Jason Rountree in Michigan State was hosting.  I've always thought what they're doing is it's probably the closest to our environment  
**[0:37:30-0:37:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:37:30):**  as far as high moisture, high snowfall, productive grounds, but trying to run a low input grazing  system.  So they were also people that I kind of looked up to as far as kind of pioneers in this world  
**[0:37:44-0:37:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:37:44):**  of trying to make grass work on productive grass or productive lands and stuff in a northern  wet environment.  Are you going to go to Grass-fed Exchange this year?  
**[0:37:53-0:37:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:37:53):**  I think it's down in Fort Worth.  It's in May, isn't it?  Yeah.  
**[0:37:58-0:38:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:37:58):**  It seems to me like, it seems like a ridiculous time to plan a grazing conference like that.  I mean, no, I'm not going to make it.  I'm going to try to be there.  
**[0:38:08-0:38:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:38:08):**  The young man I had working with me last summer, finishing his first year at college and be  starting summer break about 10 days before I got to leave.  So I'll have you...  
**[0:38:21-0:38:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:38:21):**  Are you calving?  Is that one, are you calving?  When do you calve?  
**[0:38:25-0:38:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:38:25):**  I guess.  I'm going to start in two weeks and I've been saying for about three weeks, but first  of May, like I think around the fourth or sixth of May is when I should have my first  
**[0:38:35-0:38:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:38:35):**  calf.  March or May?  May.  
**[0:38:38-0:38:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:38:38):**  March.  Did I say May?  You said May, but you also said two or three weeks.  
**[0:38:42-0:38:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:38:42):**  So I was confused.  Yeah.  We're supposed to start at the beginning of March, like sometime the fourth and the sixth,  
**[0:38:47-0:38:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:38:47):**  I think by the calendar.  But I think we both know that mother nature and genetics can play their own tricks.  So I'm expecting a couple early ones.  
**[0:38:57-0:39:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:38:57):**  Yeah.  Early today because the cold is coming.  So I won't be shocked if I make it to the cold snap and don't have some early calves.  
**[0:39:07-0:39:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:39:07):**  Okay.  So May for like that conference then May won't be too bad.  Most of your calves should be on the ground and things should be in a little bit more  
**[0:39:15-0:39:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:39:15):**  of a routine or?  Things never stop being on a routine.  We calve on the moon.  
**[0:39:20-0:39:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:39:20):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  See, I'm not weird.  
**[0:39:23-0:39:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:39:23):**  I'm just everything in one big, beautiful mess.  Okay.  I love that.  
**[0:39:27-0:39:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:39:27):**  In the picture behind me, you'll see everything from a 16 year old Longhorn cow over where  she go.  Now she's hiding 14 or 16 year old Longhorn cow.  
**[0:39:37-0:39:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:39:37):**  Like her horns are way too wide to even get down my alley, much less preg check as she  bought her.  She looks cool.  
**[0:39:46-0:39:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:39:46):**  She's here.  But everything from her down to one year olds.  All running in the same big, beautiful mess.  
**[0:39:54-0:40:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:39:54):**  Got last year's calves two years ago's calves and every cow that I've bought running in  one big, beautiful mess.  There's three steers out there.  
**[0:40:04-0:40:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:40:04):**  There's two calves, one steer calf at each generation.  And then I've got big Steve.  He's my big Longhorn.  
**[0:40:10-0:40:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:40:10):**  Big Longhorn.  I mean, if you don't have a Longhorn for pasture yard, are you really a rancher?  We are not then.  
**[0:40:19-0:40:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:40:19):**  Yeah, that's okay.  I didn't mean that.  No, I love it.  
**[0:40:24-0:40:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:40:24):**  I love it.  That's awesome.  I think that's so cool.  
**[0:40:28-0:40:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:40:28):**  So yeah, things just stay on a big, beautiful mess and I don't stop rotating when I start  calving.  Okay.  
**[0:40:35-0:40:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:40:35):**  So we're not going very far.  Like we're going across the fence line and a lot of times, that's being out there paying  attention to behavior.  
**[0:40:46-0:40:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:40:46):**  If you get them up and you're moving them all slow and you're paying attention to making  sure they get paired and you've got good maternal cattle that aren't running off and leaving  their calves and just let them go at their pace, it works great.  
**[0:40:56-0:41:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:40:56):**  But if you're trying to move them with the feed truck, that's when they just run off  and leave their calf.  Sure.  
**[0:41:03-0:41:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:41:03):**  And you suck them through a gate, you put them another pasture, you feed them and then  they get done with this massive sugar high that they've been on because you fed them.  Then they suddenly they go like, oh crap, where's my calf?  
**[0:41:17-0:41:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:41:17):**  Giving the cattle content and paired up and moving them at their own pace.  Been doing, been calving on the move for years and it's never been an issue.  How often do you move them?  
**[0:41:26-0:41:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:41:26):**  Is it the same as when you're calving as when you're not?  Right now we're like every five to seven days or so.  Okay.  
**[0:41:32-0:41:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:41:32):**  Because I'm lightly stocked and we're in big paddocks.  Just trying to make sure we've got plenty of rest going back in.  We're going to stock back up around the first of May, first of May to first of June, just  
**[0:41:44-0:41:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:41:44):**  depend on what part of the ranch we're stocking.  We're going to stock back up a little bit, but not get too aggressive because I'm staring  down the double barrel shotgun of like a record drought that's just been spreading for two  
**[0:41:55-0:42:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:41:55):**  years.  So I've been planning for it and I think I'm ready.  Okay.  
**[0:42:01-0:42:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:42:01):**  Gosh, I could ask you a million questions.  I'm fascinated by your environment and everything and stuff.  So I like to do that.  
**[0:42:10-0:42:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:42:10):**  Yeah.  Well, I want to hear about your cows.  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:42:14-0:42:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:42:14):**  No, I can tell you about them.  Our cows have changed from when my grandpa was running the farm.  He had the old, like the white face cementals, like the big ones, tall ones and stuff like  
**[0:42:29-0:42:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:42:29):**  that.  And he kind of saw that.  That wasn't made everybody want to find low birth weight bulls.  
**[0:42:34-0:42:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:42:34):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  And he just, my grandpa, he was a progressive guy kind of, at the time when he was early  
**[0:42:41-0:42:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:42:41):**  and stuff, he was running acres and farm was very advanced and stuff.  And he saw that that cemental market with the type of cattle he had, wasn't really the  direction that made a lot of sense.  
**[0:42:52-0:43:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:42:52):**  And everybody and their brother was selling registered Angus and stuff.  So he went with red Angus, which turned out to be kind of a good decision for us.  So we're 100% registered red Angus cattle is the breed we're running.  
**[0:43:06-0:43:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:43:06):**  And my dad, when he kind of took over, really after that New Zealand experience was a grass-based  kind of a guy.  And so he wasn't really interested in the big type of cattle and he was raising, he  
**[0:43:21-0:43:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:43:21):**  was breeding for kind of a more grass-based type animal himself.  And we'd always been even back into the cementals, selling a few head off the farm, kind of in  bulls as seed stock.  
**[0:43:32-0:43:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:43:32):**  Grandpa would always sell a few bulls and dad sold a few bulls and stuff too.  And so we've been raising red Angus for over 20 years, 20, 25, 30 years.  And for at least the last 20 to 25 now or so it's been grass-based genetics and kind  
**[0:43:50-0:43:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:43:50):**  of breeding for that as long as dad's been around.  You made a remark about breeding the tough ones.  Yeah.  
**[0:43:59-0:44:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:43:59):**  What do you mean by that?  Yeah.  And we raise cattle for Feral Cattle Company is kind of who we raise bulls for and stuff.  
**[0:44:10-0:44:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:44:10):**  And he's kind of who we really got that out of.  I mean, it's all about low input.  And up here, the summer forages are pretty high quality.  
**[0:44:22-0:44:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:44:22):**  I mean, we've got good lush green grass year round and stuff like that.  And so it's kind of almost a challenge to breed tough cattle, especially if you feed  all winter long, because they're getting good grass all summer and good feed all winter  
**[0:44:35-0:44:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:44:35):**  and stuff.  And so that's what we had been doing for a while.  And so really, we want cattle that can survive on what our environment produces.  
**[0:44:42-0:44:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:44:42):**  We don't want to baby them.  We don't want to stick money into them.  And we want to see the cattle that survive.  
**[0:44:51-0:45:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:44:51):**  And we have a no excuses policy where if they don't get bred back, if they have an issue  and they come up open, even if they were our favorite cow the year before they're gone.  And I always like what kid had said about, you know, you might get rid of a couple of  
**[0:45:05-0:45:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:45:05):**  good cows that way, but you'll for sure get rid of every single bad cow.  And so that's kind of been our philosophy is just pull out the you know, pull out the  the inputs, pull out the supplements and kind of the toughest we found out found to raise  
**[0:45:20-0:45:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:45:20):**  our cattle now has been like kind of corn stocks.  I don't know how we really get we can't kind of evaluate in our environment.  What do we have an abundance of?  
**[0:45:29-0:45:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:45:29):**  We have a lot of corn production around here.  The problem is most people want to turn it black before the ground freezes.  But we found one individual who is a no tiller and saw the advantage of having livestock  
**[0:45:41-0:45:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:45:41):**  on their farm.  And so we've been working with him now for the last four or five years and grazing animals  out on his corn stocks and getting like I mentioned until January 20.  
**[0:45:51-0:45:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:45:51):**  And that was great.  But we wanted to go longer than that even so we sent cows.  This is the second winter trying to send some cows down to Nebraska to graze corn stocks  
**[0:45:59-0:46:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:45:59):**  there.  And we don't supplement them with any protein.  They don't get any hay.  
**[0:46:04-0:46:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:46:04):**  It's just what they can grab and what they can eat and what they can find is what they  get.  And that trial run down to Nebraska was kind of the big question mark will they after being  
**[0:46:13-0:46:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:46:13):**  on corn stocks from end of October until the first week in March, and then hopping on a  trailer and riding 500 miles home, and we fed them when they got home, two year old  rye kind of just not nothing special at all.  
**[0:46:29-0:46:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:46:29):**  What was going to happen?  Would they throw a bunch of calves, you know, a bunch of calves and would they get bred  back?  
**[0:46:35-0:46:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:46:35):**  But we didn't lose a single calf and we had a 95% read back on those cows.  We were blown away.  So I mean, we were really happy that things seem to be working, I guess.  
**[0:46:48-0:47:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:46:48):**  One of these days, I will get all the crap out of my herd and have those conception rates.  Someday I'll get there.  I don't feed.  
**[0:47:01-0:47:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:47:01):**  You know, I try not to and I really didn't want to.  So last winter I used like a pretty, I consider it a high quality tub.  I used a Cadillac.  
**[0:47:11-0:47:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:47:11):**  I think it was a 30% tub with some probiotic in it.  Went through a lot of it.  Was it a good product?  
**[0:47:20-0:47:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:47:20):**  Yeah.  Well, when we got into this spring, you know, I made my winter.  I want to try to get my winter protein decision made in the spring.  
**[0:47:29-0:47:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:47:29):**  Like make sure I have that source secure to make sure I have that coming where there's,  you know, contract on alfalfa, making sure I've got blocks or cubes, whatever.  I mean, I think it pays to be proactive and get that stuff secured ahead of time because  
**[0:47:45-0:48:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:47:45):**  you know you're going to need it.  So I kind of looked at the cost of the tubs and talked to my partner that we're commingled.  We commingled for over 270 days with these cows.  
**[0:48:00-0:48:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:48:00):**  It started to get dry and he wanted to feed them a little more aggressively than I was  feeding mine.  So he took them home and I said, okay, that's just that many less days I got to go beat  
**[0:48:10-0:48:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:48:10):**  my feed truck up and feed everything.  So yeah, we're down to feeding about eight pounds per head of 20% alfalfa every third  day.  
**[0:48:21-0:48:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:48:21):**  Okay.  Other than that, I got to live on native range.  I even took the salt away from 60 days ago.  
**[0:48:27-0:48:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:48:27):**  Okay.  Yeah, no, that's not bad at all.  And that's what, well, I was just talking to somebody earlier today, actually from Oklahoma,  
**[0:48:34-0:48:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:48:34):**  and he kind of saw, I mean, that was the big shift in his mindset when he moved down there.  He moved from Ohio to Oklahoma actually and talked about that surprise of trying to graze  stockpiled warm season grasses and how that's very different than stockpiling cool season  
**[0:48:50-0:48:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:48:50):**  grasses.  And there almost needs to be some sort of a supplement.  And I have no idea, but I was curious how the quality, do you have any idea how the  
**[0:48:59-0:49:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:48:59):**  quality of warm season grasses compare to corn stalks?  Because that is technically a warm season grass, but technically, yes.  Corn is a grass.  
**[0:49:13-0:49:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:49:13):**  I have a hard time seeing corn as a real grass because of how much it's been manipulated.  Yeah, man.  And I'm not talking GMO.  
**[0:49:24-0:49:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:49:24):**  I'm talking crossbreeding, interbreeding, hybridizing it.  It's the corn we grow.  Yes, it is technically a grass and it fits into that family, but I would argue that it's  
**[0:49:36-0:49:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:49:36):**  just so far removed from even assembling a wild plant that it's kind of something different.  We've bred it and engineered it to go to grab all these sugars and store all these  sugars everywhere in the plant, especially in the kernel.  
**[0:49:54-0:50:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:49:54):**  And that's why they can live on corn stalks for longer is because there are some cured  sugars in there in the dry matter.  Yeah.  
**[0:50:02-0:50:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:50:02):**  And that makes sense.  That's kind of what I was wondering.  A lot of this is bred for even corn silage, like the whole plant, not just the kernel  
**[0:50:10-0:50:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:50:10):**  and stuff is bred for feed quality.  So I imagine that's not all going to go away when it goes dormant.  So the analog is for me is making sure that I have a chance.  
**[0:50:23-0:50:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:50:23):**  I give my warm season grasses a chance to complete stage four of growth, which is putting  up the big stem and seed head.  I love going out and walking through chest high Indian grass in mid September.  
**[0:50:36-0:50:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:50:36):**  Mid September when the Indian grass is in full bloom is one of my favorite times of  the year.  And if you turn cattle in, there's about a three, almost a four week period where they  
**[0:50:50-0:50:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:50:50):**  will run in and they will strip those seeds out of that Indian grass seed head first.  That's the first thing they'd go for.  Really?  
**[0:50:59-0:51:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:50:59):**  Yeah.  They're talking a tiny little seed and they got to get a lot of them.  But those cows know there's something in there that they want.  
**[0:51:06-0:51:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:51:06):**  Just like we see them eating all kinds of weird shit like yucca blooms.  I had a group that would go in to the Sandhill plum thickets and ignore the leaves and eat  the green ones.  
**[0:51:19-0:51:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:51:19):**  Only the green ones, not the red ripe ones.  Tell me why.  Well, I mean, that's what and I'm not finished yet.  
**[0:51:26-0:51:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:51:26):**  I'm sitting right behind me.  The Fred Provenza book, Nourishment.  Have you read that?  
**[0:51:30-0:51:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:51:30):**  No, I haven't.  I should.  Okay.  
**[0:51:33-0:51:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:51:33):**  He's a future guest on the Ranching Reboot podcast.  Fred.  I hope to get them online too.  
**[0:51:37-0:51:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:51:37):**  So yeah, it's incredible what he does.  I mean, I feel bad.  I always laugh because I imagine he had to have some sort of a grad student or something  
**[0:51:46-0:51:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:51:46):**  do this research.  But he talks in the one book about they followed around a cow.  Like what I'm imagining, and I don't know if this is exactly how it happened was he  
**[0:51:55-0:52:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:51:55):**  said, all right, grad student, you're following Bessie, you're following, you know, old Betsy  or whatever, follow them, you know, all throughout the day.  And every time they take a bite, try and you know, essentially, they would try and grab  
**[0:52:06-0:52:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:52:06):**  the same bite, represent what they got.  And then they ended up taking that and doing a nutritional test on what that cow had eaten,  based on what they kind of grabbed.  
**[0:52:14-0:52:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:52:14):**  And they found that that cow had picked like the perfect ration.  I mean, it was incredible.  I feel bad for that grad student, but it was pretty neat to read.  
**[0:52:23-0:52:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:52:23):**  So I had heard that it was down on the south end of the ranch back in the spring, moved  him into a paddock that I knew had really great cool season grass down around this little  pit pond and in the creek that comes out of it.  
**[0:52:39-0:52:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:52:39):**  And I knew where there's some other really good stuff up this draw.  So we moved him in, made a sweep, made sure we had them all cleaned out of the other ones,  grabbed them in with the tubs, moved them over.  
**[0:52:48-0:52:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:52:48):**  And then I looked to see where the cattle were.  Half of them were in a corner.  They were over in the southeast corner where there wasn't a whole lot of grass.  
**[0:52:57-0:53:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:52:57):**  And I'm thinking, there shouldn't be anything up there.  Why are they up there?  So we jumped in the gator and buzzed over there and looked.  
**[0:53:05-0:53:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:53:05):**  Well, they were eating this clover that was about six inches tall that I couldn't see  through the grass.  Real quick, like I grabbed a big old handful of it and ran out the gate and got my little  
**[0:53:18-0:53:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:53:18):**  plant smasher and smashed it down, got some juice to put on my brick meter.  And it looked, 26 bricks.  Wow.  
**[0:53:26-0:53:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:53:26):**  No wonder they wanted to go over to that corner of the pasture and cut clover.  Now, these cows had never been on the ranch before.  How did they know it was there?  
**[0:53:34-0:53:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:53:34):**  And how did they get there within five minutes after being moved into that pasture?  Hmm.  That's incredible.  
**[0:53:40-0:53:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:53:40):**  I'm curious, what are your bricks typically on your natives in that region?  Okay.  So I measure, I like to measure my bricks around 2 PM during the summer.  
**[0:53:55-0:54:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:53:55):**  That's around peak photosynthesis.  That's close to when you're going to get your peak sugars.  We can argue about the pennies and like, what time was solar max summer?  
**[0:54:04-0:54:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:54:04):**  When was peak photosynthesis?  You know what?  Two o'clock is good enough for my work.  
**[0:54:09-0:54:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:54:09):**  So I try to measure, if I'm going to make a serious measurement, I try to look at it  at two o'clock.  And most of the year, you know, a lot of my warm season grasses, they're staying down  
**[0:54:20-0:54:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:54:20):**  in the three, four, five range.  But when they're really good to eat, when I noticed the cattle are really selecting  them, those things are up in the six to eight range.  
**[0:54:29-0:54:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:54:29):**  So I had a lot of, I had a, like just after we'd get a little bit of moisture, get a little  flush of growth.  One day I could get six and the next day go to the same area on the same plants and barely  
**[0:54:43-0:54:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:54:43):**  get four.  Interesting.  Huh?  
**[0:54:46-0:54:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:54:46):**  So our native, like native plants are definitely not going to be as sweet as anything we're  going to plant.  And Brix directly correlates to growth.  
**[0:54:59-0:55:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:54:59):**  Doug Ferguson says that, I think Zithman says that, you know, four to five range, you're  going to put on pound, pound and a half a day.  You get up around six and it's closer to two.  
**[0:55:11-0:55:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:55:11):**  You get up like 16 bricks, you're putting on four pounds a day.  I mean, you're, you're like feedlot ration.  Yeah.  
**[0:55:18-0:55:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:55:18):**  Yeah.  I wonder what feedlot ration would be if you ground it up and put it on a Brix meter.  Worth trying.  
**[0:55:26-0:55:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:55:26):**  I'd be curious.  Pretty high.  That'd be really high.  
**[0:55:29-0:55:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:55:29):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, that's, that's, that's, that's interesting.  
**[0:55:34-0:55:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:55:34):**  And I, I've always wondered, I've heard, maybe I don't know what kind of region you're, you're  in and stuff, but some of that Western, no, that's more short grass, I guess.  That's got the punch.  
**[0:55:44-0:55:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:55:44):**  It's supposed to just have this punch.  People talk about, I don't really know.  Ours is pretty high water, you'd protein mix and stuff, but that more warm season or Western  
**[0:55:52-0:56:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:55:52):**  grasses are just, they got this punch that everybody talks about that gets cattle growing  like crazy.  Is that a Brix thing or something else in the grass?  
**[0:56:00-0:56:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:56:00):**  Uh, it's a, it's a Brix thing and it's a growth phase thing.  So sometimes you got to kind of consider the source, right?  You know, what are these guys managing?  
**[0:56:12-0:56:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:56:12):**  Like they're saying that this, you know, just short grass has a lot of punch on it and put  a lot of weight on, you know, look at their pasture.  And if it all looks like a pool table, you know, the old saying, the only tool you have  
**[0:56:24-0:56:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:56:24):**  is a hammer.  Every problem looks like a nail.  You know, I think there's a lot of guys that think that something is good grass when they've  
**[0:56:32-0:56:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:56:32):**  never really seen what good grass is.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[0:56:36-0:56:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:56:36):**  I'm sure that's true.  Yeah.  I've driven to the Western end of the state several times, you know, out to Denver, out  
**[0:56:42-0:56:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:56:42):**  to Albuquerque.  And it always used to blow my mind where I'd hear people from just a few miles West of  me say, Oh, well, Alexander, we can't grow that blue stem here.  
**[0:56:53-0:56:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:56:53):**  We can't grow that Indian grass here.  This is short grass Prairie.  You're just right on the edge.  
**[0:56:58-0:57:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:56:58):**  And I believed it until you drive all the way out to like Ulysses or Colby or, or Holly  Colorado and you see fucking big blue stem and Indian grass growing six foot tall in  the ditches.  
**[0:57:10-0:57:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:57:10):**  Yeah.  Astrid next door is grazed to an inch high.  Like let's consider the source here.  
**[0:57:17-0:57:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:57:17):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, that's a, well, that's, that's relevant with so much right there.  
**[0:57:23-0:57:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:57:23):**  Right.  How much are people actually looking at actively at what they're doing and how that impacts  what they're used to?  
**[0:57:29-0:57:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:57:29):**  I mean, gosh, it's.  And even more fun comparison to do down the ditch, like if you've got places that are  broke up between, you know, a mile of pasture and then some row crop ground, right down  
**[0:57:41-0:57:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:57:41):**  that stretch of road and look at what the ditches look like next to that pasture.  You might have some fairly healthy talk, like say healthy.  You'll see some taller grasses.  
**[0:57:52-0:57:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:57:52):**  You'll see some bigger plants.  You'll see probably less weeds.  Yeah.  
**[0:57:57-0:58:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:57:57):**  And by that farm field, it's either going to be kind of full of one weed or full of  one really crappy type of grass.  Why is that?  
**[0:58:06-0:58:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:58:06):**  I mean, even if the pasture is totally abused and grazed to dirt, the ditch is still going  to reflect that that pasture is cleaning the life in some way.  But what the ditches are telling me next to those farm fields is those farm fields are  
**[0:58:23-0:58:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:58:23):**  been so sprayed with such a higher herbicide load that it's just creeped out under the  fence and nothing can grow in that barge.  Yeah.  
**[0:58:31-0:58:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:58:31):**  No, I like the comparison of the ditches and stuff too, because everything is like management.  You could turn the cattle out in spring and pick them up in the fall and say, you don't  really manage them, but you're managing for something in our area.  
**[0:58:47-0:58:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:58:47):**  I mean, it's long-term, it's selecting for Kentucky bluegrass.  I mean, it's lawn.  It's essentially like a lawn and stuff like that.  
**[0:58:54-0:59:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:58:54):**  People look at our pastures and see them.  They're pretty different.  And honestly, people are like, what?  
**[0:59:00-0:59:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:59:00):**  You got all those weeds out there.  All those, I don't know.  We plant diversity and people just think it's ridiculous and stuff, but it's exactly, it's  
**[0:59:09-0:59:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:59:09):**  beautiful.  It's not a weed.  It's just good cow feed, man.  
**[0:59:12-0:59:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:59:12):**  Exactly.  Yeah.  I remember several years ago, I went to a KNRC thing and one of the presentations was  
**[0:59:20-0:59:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:59:20):**  how to get cows to eat Palmer amaranth.  And me being a, you know, not necessarily a well book educated guy.  I don't know what Palmer amaranth is.  
**[0:59:33-0:59:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:59:33):**  I know what hay weeds are.  Okay.  Yeah.  
**[0:59:37-0:59:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:59:37):**  Yeah.  As it turns out, they're kind of the same thing.  And I think cows love pigweeds.  
**[0:59:42-0:59:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:59:42):**  Like I turn cows into pasture pigweeds and they're not there in 30 minutes.  Like they go straight for them and just absolutely destroy them.  But apparently cows or pigweeds in a cornfield is kind of a bad thing.  
**[0:59:55-1:00:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=0:59:55):**  So people were trying to get their cows to figure out how to eat the pigweed.  Like it's easy.  They'll want to eat it.  
**[1:00:02-1:00:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:00:02):**  Like, cause it's usually a really, really high, really powerful plant.  Speaking of bricks, like you mentioned earlier, my wife and I were driving around on the four  wheeler doing bricks readings here and did, you know, some grass over here, some clover  
**[1:00:15-1:00:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:00:15):**  over here, some whatever over here.  And then we did ragweed.  We have a ton of ragweed.  
**[1:00:19-1:00:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:00:19):**  That's our biggest problem on our farm.  And with the organic cropping and ragweed has been, I don't know if you know that if  you got that in your region at all or not, 10 foot tall, massive weeds and stuff.  
**[1:00:31-1:00:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:00:31):**  Our kennel.  Our kennel take after, you know, they're all over the field, nipping the leaves, ripping  the leaves off of that ragweed.  
**[1:00:39-1:00:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:00:39):**  And that was the highest bricks reading of anything that we tested that day.  Grasses, clover, everything.  It was the ragweed.  
**[1:00:45-1:00:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:00:45):**  And so now like when people look out and I see what a weedy pasture, everything is just  another diverse forage species and stuff, you know, in a cornfield.  Sure.  
**[1:00:55-1:01:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:00:55):**  You're missing out.  The ragweed is our worst enemy in the cornfield.  And I've spent many a years pulling weeds.  
**[1:01:02-1:01:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:01:02):**  And that was one of the reasons why we wanted to go to crops too, or cattle and pasture.  I hated pulling weeds.  We in high school, we had my whole football team would go out in the summers and just  
**[1:01:13-1:01:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:01:13):**  pull ragweed up and down the rows, hundreds of acres, just one row under your legs, one  on each side, yanking ragweeds out and stuff.  So never will I have to do that if I just let a cow eat it.  
**[1:01:24-1:01:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:01:24):**  And so yeah, another advantage of pasture.  It's not a weed.  It's just good cow feed.  
**[1:01:31-1:01:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:01:31):**  Well, my cows won't eat it.  Well, your cows are spoiled rotten and they don't know how to eat.  They don't know how to eat.  
**[1:01:38-1:01:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:01:38):**  Well, I think, yeah.  And I think part of it is like they may not eat it, not because it's not good for them  or because they won't like it because they've never learned to eat it and stuff.  
**[1:01:46-1:01:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:01:46):**  Like honestly, when we put the high stock density, it's, I mean, we've done, we're fortunate.  That's one advantage of our area, high rainfall and stuff.  We can do stock densities in excess of half a million pounds per acre if we wanted to  
**[1:01:56-1:02:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:01:56):**  and stuff.  I mean, fairly consistently when you force them, when you get high stock density over  a hundred thousand pounds, 200,000 pounds, they're going to eat whatever is in front  
**[1:02:07-1:02:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:02:07):**  of them.  Yeah.  They're going to eat it just because they want something or the neighbor's going to  
**[1:02:10-1:02:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:02:10):**  get it and they're not going to get a bite.  So once you get them, forcing them to eat that ragweed, the next time you bump that  population down to 40,000 pounds or less, or whatever, you can give them free range  
**[1:02:21-1:02:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:02:21):**  and they'll choose the ragweed because they now see that, Oh yeah, I've eaten that.  That was actually pretty darn good.  So it's kind of neat.  
**[1:02:31-1:02:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:02:31):**  So what kind of Brix readings do you, what kind of Brix readings are you getting on your  stuff?  Yeah.  
**[1:02:36-1:02:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:02:36):**  Like, I don't mind sharing mine, but there's been a couple of times where I've shared mine  and been like, well, Hey, what's yours?  I'm like, well, that's proprietary secret.  
**[1:02:46-1:02:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:02:46):**  Really come on, man.  Yeah.  And gosh, you know, I feel like dumb because I can't even remember now I look at it.  
**[1:02:53-1:03:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:02:53):**  I want to say eight to 10, but I could be totally off.  We can get into the teens I've seen in the teens multiple times, but when I think we  were looking at that ragweed, I think was 18.  
**[1:03:04-1:03:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:03:04):**  I'm pretty sure that day, but I can't even remember what the rest of it was.  I don't, it sounds like you do it quite regularly.  I probably do it once a year, so that's neat and forget about it.  
**[1:03:13-1:03:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:03:13):**  I need to do it more regularly.  I have a couple of times a week if I remember.  Really?  
**[1:03:17-1:03:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:03:17):**  Yeah.  Wow.  Do you see seasonal patterns and different or like different paddocks and things like,  
**[1:03:23-1:03:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:03:23):**  do you actually see trends when you're doing it that regularly?  I'm not yet.  I'm still trying to collect data in two years of data points.  
**[1:03:33-1:03:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:03:33):**  It isn't really a whole lot.  Yeah.  And you're actually, you are keeping track and recording them?  
**[1:03:39-1:03:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:03:39):**  I have a book.  That's awesome.  Oh, that's super cool.  
**[1:03:43-1:03:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:03:43):**  You got to get you to share that sometime down the road when you have something to show  for it, because I'm sure it'll change as your management and stuff changes.  I'm excited.  
**[1:03:53-1:03:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:03:53):**  That's neat.  Yeah.  And trying to keep track of everything between this is the management we've been doing here,  
**[1:03:58-1:04:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:03:58):**  this is the management we've been doing here and track those, and track that trend over  a long time and say, okay, this is the BRICs representative in this area before we moved  him in.  
**[1:04:10-1:04:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:04:10):**  And then this is what it was like two days post-grace, 21 days, 45, things like that.  I'd love to have the time to be able to do all that data collection, but cows got to  move, fence has to be checked, mineral has to be hauled.  
**[1:04:27-1:04:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:04:27):**  That's the tough thing about all the things that I would love to record data points on  and stuff.  We picked up a pasture in 2016 and before that said, next pasture we get or next farm  
**[1:04:38-1:04:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:04:38):**  we get, I want to go out and do all these different data points and soil tests and water  infiltration and penetrometer tests.  Just so that when we manage four years down the road, five years down the road, we'll  
**[1:04:47-1:04:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:04:47):**  be able to show.  And it's like, then we got the pasture, spring came around, we're calving, we're moving cows,  we're planting crops, never got to it.  
**[1:04:55-1:05:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:04:55):**  And here we are four years later and still just like nothing, just observation.  Hey, the samples would have been awful cool.  Yeah, it would have been.  
**[1:05:04-1:05:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:05:04):**  But I think it's always kind of fun when you go to like a farm conference.  I mean, even some ranching conferences and they're like, you ever thought about soil  testing?  
**[1:05:15-1:05:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:05:15):**  Sure have.  What's your pitch?  Well, this is what we want to look for and this is the sample we take and this is how  
**[1:05:21-1:05:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:05:21):**  we process it and this is how much it costs.  Okay, great.  How close do you want to sample?  
**[1:05:26-1:05:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:05:26):**  Oh, we usually do a 10 acre grid.  Okay, an acre grid.  Let me get my calculator out.  
**[1:05:31-1:05:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:05:31):**  10 acre grid on 1000 acres is yeah, that's about three times what I make on cows in a  year.  So yeah, yeah, yeah.  
**[1:05:40-1:05:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:05:40):**  Yeah, no, that's the I think I'm not a cropping expert, but I think those guys do even some  of them are two acre grids.  Is that it?  
**[1:05:49-1:05:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:05:49):**  I'm not sure.  I mean, it's, it's wild.  Some of the people on there testing and how precise with their precision ag and stuff  
**[1:05:53-1:06:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:05:53):**  they get with their variable rate, everything and stuff, but I don't know if that pencils  as well on pasture land or especially on rangeland down in your country.  Yeah, the precision ag and making sure we get the right amount of chemical in the exact  
**[1:06:07-1:06:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:06:07):**  right spot to the inch.  I support that.  I mean, it's less waste.  
**[1:06:12-1:06:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:06:12):**  It's less waste, less chemical use, less diesel fuel.  And in the end, that's better for all of us.  So you know, I support that stuff.  
**[1:06:20-1:06:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:06:20):**  Yeah, yeah.  They'd have to put a pretty good argument together to say why you should, why it's how  it's going to pay for you.  
**[1:06:28-1:06:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:06:28):**  Right.  Right.  Yeah.  
**[1:06:31-1:06:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:06:31):**  So I'm kind of curious, how long have you guys been, been raising bulls for Pharaoh?  I asked dad and he can't remember the exact year.  It's been, we think 13 could have been 14 years now.  
**[1:06:44-1:06:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:06:44):**  We've been doing that.  And yeah, that kind of happened.  Dad was down there buying a bull cause he was raising kind of low input grass-based  
**[1:06:52-1:07:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:06:52):**  genetics and found, came across Pharaoh and, um, and, uh, bought one and got talking and  kind of got tied into him that way and stuff.  So we've been with them ever since.  
**[1:07:02-1:07:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:07:02):**  Yeah.  Has that been a pretty good deal for you guys?  Yeah.  
**[1:07:06-1:07:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:07:06):**  Yeah, no, it has.  And it's, I mean, up in my area, I'd say one of the biggest advantages, my dad and grandpa  were selling bulls, like I say for decades, but in my area, almost everything is cropland.  
**[1:07:18-1:07:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:07:18):**  And the people who have cows have 10 to 20, 30, maybe 40 cows out on a little chunk of  pasture that's too steep or too rocky to run crops on.  It's not really, they don't take it seriously and they don't put a whole lot of money into  
**[1:07:31-1:07:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:07:31):**  it.  And so to be able to market bulls nine months out of the year, what's that probably haul  feed to them nine months out of the year.  
**[1:07:38-1:07:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:07:38):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  For sure.  
**[1:07:41-1:07:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:07:41):**  Most are at least, at least five months, six to seven months, probably more realistically  for most guys that I know of are feeding somehow.  And it's not really, maybe they think it is or something.  
**[1:07:52-1:08:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:07:52):**  I would say it's not really a large contributing factor of their profit, a profit to their  overall operation.  And so to sell bulls in this region is, there's not that many customers and they don't pay  
**[1:08:05-1:08:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:08:05):**  as much as when you get out in cattle country.  So it's been advantageous for us just to kind of connect into some of the Western markets,  some of the more cattle country markets and stuff that we have.  
**[1:08:13-1:08:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:08:13):**  So yeah, overall, we've been really happy with it.  And I mean, I do believe in their program, obviously, and stuff we're doing.  It's neat to see these cattle work in different environments and stuff.  
**[1:08:25-1:08:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:08:25):**  So we've been fortunate to get connected with them and then just to learn what a great group  of people willing to think differently and stuff too.  There's a couple of Pharaoh Cattle Company bulls I've had my eyes on for a while.  
**[1:08:38-1:08:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:08:38):**  Oh, yeah.  AI catalog or?  Yes.  
**[1:08:42-1:09:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:08:42):**  And I'm not sure how I feel about that because trying to AI a bunch of horn cattle is probably  not the most intelligent operation to undertake.  So I'm thinking, I'm really thinking there's a couple of Michonne bulls that are in a catalog  
**[1:09:03-1:09:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:09:03):**  that are very attractive to me or mostly the carcass traits and what I think they'll do  with the genetics that I'm developing.  Yeah.  
**[1:09:13-1:09:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:09:13):**  Well, I know you've been...  I heard you talk on one of your past podcasts and stuff too about your goal of...  Sounds like trying to do a similar thing of raise these low input, tough cattle that fit  
**[1:09:24-1:09:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:09:24):**  your environment.  And someday you'd like to get to a point where you're marketing either females or maybe some  males and stuff too, right?  
**[1:09:30-1:09:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:09:30):**  That's goal of yours?  100%.  Yeah.  
**[1:09:34-1:09:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:09:34):**  My cows, I don't think anything of mine is probably ever going to see the inside of a  sale barn anymore.  Yeah.  
**[1:09:41-1:09:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:09:41):**  Because I'll admit I sold some there and that was probably the dumbest place I ever could  have sold any.  I take that one.  
**[1:09:51-1:10:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:09:51):**  But from here on out, so from here on out, everything's closed.  Every calf being born this year was bred on the ranch.  I can't say that for last year's calf crop or the calf crop before that.  
**[1:10:05-1:10:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:10:05):**  This calf crop is the first one hitting the ground that is 100% me from conception onwards.  And that's the product I want to be proud to put my name behind.  Sure.  
**[1:10:16-1:10:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:10:16):**  Hopefully when a couple of them get peeled and go to freezer camp in 2025, I'll have  something worth having.  That's the goal.  
**[1:10:28-1:10:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:10:28):**  That's the goal.  So when...  Because you're primarily a Corianni kind of base.  
**[1:10:35-1:10:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:10:35):**  Is that right?  Corientes, Longhorns, and there are some crosses in there that I bought.  But yeah.  
**[1:10:41-1:10:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:10:41):**  So for some reason, this seems to be a thing as of late.  I've had a bunch of people reaching out wanting to learn more about that.  So I mean, are you...  
**[1:10:49-1:10:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:10:49):**  Is your herd...  Do you hope it to be kind of purebred and you sell crossbred calves?  Do you want to have a crossbred, like a 50% mama cow?  
**[1:10:59-1:11:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:10:59):**  What's your kind of goal for your program?  Well, we've got in, we bred in Angus last year and we had quite a few opens and I didn't  have any marketing figured out.  
**[1:11:11-1:11:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:11:11):**  So I said, okay, well, let's add some value back.  So we turned in some bulls for 45 days to try for a fall breed.  I know there's at least three or four of them that didn't catch.  
**[1:11:23-1:11:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:11:23):**  No big deal.  So we've got some Angus in them.  We've got some Fleckovich influence Cimetal in them, which I was really happy with the  
**[1:11:30-1:11:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:11:30):**  carcass size on those bulls.  They're a full frame smaller than the black ones, but they're carrying a full condition  higher.  
**[1:11:40-1:11:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:11:40):**  Sure.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[1:11:43-1:11:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:11:43):**  When you could carry a seven on a frame six versus a six on a six, I know what I want  to have in my cows.  As far as breeding up next year, got three text messages while we've been doing this  
**[1:11:56-1:12:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:11:56):**  interview trying to get that worked out.  So...  Okay.  
**[1:12:00-1:12:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:12:00):**  I'm not sure if we're going to come back on top with Angus or with something a little  different, but most likely it'll be Angus.  I want to get to where I have a 50-50 base herd.  
**[1:12:12-1:12:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:12:12):**  And then maybe we can kind of moderate that 50-50 base herd and start to look at some  more, I guess, terminal type traits.  But for now I'm more concerned with developing my maternal herd.  
**[1:12:25-1:12:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:12:25):**  And the Angus and the Sim bulls are to try to bulk up or to try to put another frame  size on the Corriente.  Hopefully what I keep from the Corriente is their stayability, their trout, their foraging  
**[1:12:42-1:12:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:12:42):**  ability, their inherent health and pest and disease resistance.  And just their efficiency.  Isn't that one of the biggest things about them?  
**[1:12:51-1:13:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:12:51):**  They're just like, they can make it by on dirt almost.  You can just about feed them sticks, rocks and dirt and make them drink air and they  can get along.  
**[1:13:01-1:13:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:13:01):**  Because that might not be the best, but yeah, you can push them really, really hard.  And they know how to eat everything in the pasture.  The core group that I've got here, they're with me strip grazing.  
**[1:13:16-1:13:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:13:16):**  And I mean, we had those things at 45 to 55,000 pounds per acre on a daily move.  If it was in the past, they had to eat it.  Like there's willow trees that they eat.  
**[1:13:25-1:13:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:13:25):**  And some of you felt enough of a taste for the willow trees that they'll go seek that  out the first couple of hours in a pasture if there's a good one.  It's weird to see a cow running past green grass and green weeds that you know are super  
**[1:13:39-1:13:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:13:39):**  high in bricks and super high in nutrients.  And she's going to need a dang willow tree.  Yeah.  
**[1:13:45-1:13:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:13:45):**  Yeah.  No, that's the truth.  And something you just made me think back to that Fred Provenza book and stuff where  
**[1:13:52-1:14:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:13:52):**  he talks about all of the other like nutrients and like the secondary to tertiary nutrients  and stuff and these other things that they can balance their diet.  Cows are so dang smart if you let them, if you let them.  
**[1:14:02-1:14:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:14:02):**  That's the one thing that I love about your environment anyway, that it seems like that  we don't have much of here is the extent of the diversity.  I imagine you've got way more diversity than we have even in our pastures, which we try  
**[1:14:14-1:14:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:14:14):**  to seed in diversity is nothing like native rangeland.  So we'll throw out a couple terms here.  You know, native range gets thrown out a lot.  
**[1:14:23-1:14:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:14:23):**  Okay.  And I don't want to discourage anybody from using the term native range because it's very  descriptive of, you know, of a forage condition.  
**[1:14:31-1:14:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:14:31):**  But there's a new term I'd like to start using that's old growth grassland.  Okay.  Okay.  
**[1:14:37-1:14:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:14:37):**  And that's grassland that's never been fucked up with a plow.  Yeah.  Never been planted, never been farmed.  
**[1:14:42-1:14:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:14:42):**  You can take a piece of farm ground, plant natives in it, decent management in a few  years, it's back to native range, but it will never be old growth grassland again, because  old growth grassland is going to be defined by the soil structure that's been developed  
**[1:14:58-1:15:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:14:58):**  since the last ice age.  And in my mind.  Yeah.  
**[1:15:02-1:15:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:15:02):**  So that being said, the whole place is about 7,000 acres of that maybe five or 600 of it  was ever farmed.  Zero of it is farmed now.  
**[1:15:13-1:15:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:15:13):**  So, and I can tell differences on the places that have been farmed that are planted back  to native range.  And it was a process.  
**[1:15:23-1:15:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:15:23):**  Dad started planting them back in 1986, 85, 86, right after he took over the ranch because  he didn't want to farm.  Like the farm tractor that he got was a 65 horsepower open cab Massey Ferguson.  
**[1:15:39-1:15:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:15:39):**  I think the biggest tool that would fit, but that he had that was out here that would go  behind it was like 10 feet.  Wow.  
**[1:15:46-1:15:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:15:46):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  That all got planted back to native grass.  
**[1:15:55-1:16:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:15:55):**  And I remember when I was drilling up going down there and there was never really anything  impressive growing.  It wasn't until I moved away and came back from the Navy that there was actually some  
**[1:16:06-1:16:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:16:06):**  impressive forage, impressive grass going down there in the late nineties, he came back  and put a Ford mix on it because what he seeded it with in the eighties was just straight  grass seed.  
**[1:16:16-1:16:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:16:16):**  It didn't have any Forbes in it at all because thinking at the time, why don't we want, we  don't want to put weeds out there.  Cows don't eat weeds.  
**[1:16:24-1:16:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:16:24):**  Cows eat grass.  Let's just see that all the grass.  What a, what a, what a shortsighted and uneducated mindset that was.  
**[1:16:33-1:16:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:16:33):**  Yeah.  So in the nineties, late nineties, he went back out and, and put some Forbes back on  it.  
**[1:16:40-1:16:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:16:40):**  And once those Forbes started to get established, I could, I could use the pasture.  And there are a couple of years that I used it just perfect.  And we got the perfect rain right after I used it just hard enough.  
**[1:16:55-1:17:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:16:55):**  And I had enough rest.  And well, next thing you know, we've got five, six foot tall, big blue stem and Indian grass  and switchgrass coming back and healthy little blues and you know, all the, all the other,  
**[1:17:06-1:17:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:17:06):**  like the Grama grasses and everything was coming back.  Even Forbes were coming back.  So yeah, that's, that's cool.  
**[1:17:15-1:17:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:17:15):**  We've wanted a couple of years back.  We like look pretty seriously at planting more natives in our region up here and kind  of what we learned and talk to people.  
**[1:17:26-1:17:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:17:26):**  And it takes, it sounds like it took you quite a while to get it established and stuff like  that.  And here it was going to be, people were saying three years up to five years to kind of get  
**[1:17:36-1:17:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:17:36):**  it established where we really got to baby it and take some time and kind of be easy  on it.  And when you're honest, I mean, we could probably get at least $250, if not $300 plus dollar  
**[1:17:46-1:18:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:17:46):**  an acre land rent here, when you're setting line land kind of aside or not really harvesting  much off of it for two to five years to try and get something established.  It's a pretty expensive establishment cost.  
**[1:18:00-1:18:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:18:00):**  And I don't know if they call our stuff, improved grasses, these kind of cool season mixes and  stuff that we get now.  And I don't know if they're really improved or not.  
**[1:18:10-1:18:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:18:10):**  They're improved in some part, some ways, maybe the nutritional content, not so much  the hardiness and the stability of some of the other plants and stuff.  But that's kind of the route we've gone just because it seems like it just isn't cost effective  
**[1:18:24-1:18:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:18:24):**  for us to try and establish warm season native mixes up here.  But I remember my dad telling me something and it was a long time ago.  He said, no matter what you do, don't ever get involved with the grass of the month club.  
**[1:18:43-1:18:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:18:43):**  Okay.  And I took, I've kind of lived by that.  Yeah.  
**[1:18:51-1:19:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:18:51):**  There've been several opportunities and places to plant something like, no, I don't want  that.  I don't want that improved grass.  
**[1:19:03-1:19:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:19:03):**  I don't want that.  I think the lessons we've been learning, a lot of these grasses that are quote improved  and the one that comes to mind right now is like the current devil of the Plains, Old  
**[1:19:14-1:19:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:19:14):**  World Bluestem.  We bred that in the lab.  We bred it to be allopathic and allotropic and spread and be drought resistant.  
**[1:19:26-1:19:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:19:26):**  Problem is we didn't breed it to be palatable for cows.  So it establishes really easy as drought tolerant, fire tolerant, chemical tolerant.  Like you could spray old world, like the yellow and Caucasian types that I have here.  
**[1:19:40-1:19:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:19:40):**  We sprayed some to absolute bare soil for three years in a row.  Like nuked it to bare soil.  And guess what's growing there?  
**[1:19:51-1:19:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:19:51):**  Same stuff.  Same stuff.  Old World Bluestem and nothing else.  
**[1:19:56-1:20:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:19:56):**  It's almost like we bred a super grass that doesn't do much for cows.  Okay.  Do cows eat it?  
**[1:20:05-1:20:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:20:05):**  Yes.  There's not much nutrition in it.  Like I've never been able to get a Brix reading from Old World Bluestem.  
**[1:20:13-1:20:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:20:13):**  Really?  Period.  Wow.  
**[1:20:16-1:20:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:20:16):**  You don't have any other ruminant species like sheep or goats or anything?  No?  Okay.  
**[1:20:23-1:20:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:20:23):**  I wish I did.  Yeah.  I wish I had them about a year ago.  
**[1:20:26-1:20:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:20:26):**  Yeah.  It's a lot of ground to cover and I'm just one guy.  I guess I'll say it because it's on my podcast and I can get away with it.  
**[1:20:36-1:20:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:20:36):**  If you come out here and run sheep and goats and make me an offer, like I might not even  charge you for it.  Just bring them out here because I need some goat brush control in places.  
**[1:20:46-1:20:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:20:46):**  Like yeah.  Links in show notes.  You get stuck with me.  
**[1:20:50-1:20:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:20:50):**  That's awesome.  Yeah.  No, that's one thing that I talked to Luke Perman not too long ago.  
**[1:20:58-1:21:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:20:58):**  If you've met him or talked to him or anything, who brought in custom sheep.  He's on one of my episodes and stuff.  It brought in a couple thousand sheep, just custom grazing.  
**[1:21:09-1:21:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:21:09):**  And he says he doesn't think it's affected his cattle, like how much forage he has for  cattle.  So it's not really affected his stocking rate.  
**[1:21:15-1:21:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:21:15):**  He gets a custom fee.  They're taking care of weeds that he otherwise would have had to spray.  It's like, what a win, win, win, win, win.  
**[1:21:22-1:21:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:21:22):**  Everyone around when you start messing with some of these other ruminants and provide  opportunity for a young guy, someone in your community, maybe who wants to get started  in something that doesn't have a ranch of their own.  
**[1:21:33-1:21:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:21:33):**  That's pretty neat.  I'd love to help a young person get started with sheep and build a business.  Like I'm out for that because underutilized resource, it's a demand.  
**[1:21:44-1:21:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:21:44):**  The two fastest growing ethnic group in the country are the Muslims and Hispanics.  They like sheep and goat.  Someone was telling me, and I don't know if there's any truth to this or not, but that  
**[1:21:57-1:22:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:21:57):**  it's cheap anyway, is the only industry with increasing demand and reducing supply consistently  over the last however many decades.  It's continuously increased supply or increased demand reduced supply.  
**[1:22:10-1:22:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:22:10):**  That's a good thing to be in that industry.  I can believe that.  I was just sitting here thinking like, I kind of almost have this theory and it's not even  
**[1:22:22-1:22:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:22:22):**  a half-baked theory.  Did the sheep industry go by the wayside because big meat couldn't figure out a way to industrialize  it?  
**[1:22:32-1:22:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:22:32):**  I mean.  It's a good question.  I guess I always assumed and I have no idea, but assumed that it was because once people,  
**[1:22:45-1:22:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:22:45):**  I've always heard the ranches of the West were paid for with sheep and then nobody ever  really liked them necessarily.  So once they had the ranch paid for, it's like, well, now we can do what we want.  
**[1:22:54-1:23:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:22:54):**  Let's move back to these cows and stuff or something.  But I don't know if that's any sort of a factual theory or not.  That's just what I've kind of wondered.  
**[1:23:04-1:23:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:23:04):**  In the last few years, I've been fortunate enough to work with some of the old cowboys  that worked out here on this ranch in the sixties and seventies and that knew my great-great-grandfather  to put all this crap together and tell me that he went broke with cows many times.  
**[1:23:30-1:23:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:23:30):**  When he always got back and whenever he'd go broke with cows, he'd get sheep, make a  fortune on sheep in like two years, get rid of the sheep and get back in cows, lose his  ass in a couple of years and then go back to sheep.  
**[1:23:46-1:23:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:23:46):**  Wow.  All for the love of the cow.  Yeah.  
**[1:23:50-1:24:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:23:50):**  It's pretty crazy.  That's funny.  I heard it first on Clay Connery's excellent working cows podcast.  
**[1:24:00-1:24:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:24:00):**  He's my pod father.  Is he yours?  I like that.  
**[1:24:05-1:24:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:24:05):**  He's probably the egg or the ranching pod father.  I remember the first time I heard of podcasts at a wedding from a buddy of mine and I just  started typing in like into the search bar cows, cattle, ranch things and found working  
**[1:24:18-1:24:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:24:18):**  cows podcast.  It was one of the first ones I listened to and I was like, well, here we go.  This is it.  
**[1:24:24-1:24:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:24:24):**  When he calls me, I answer the phone.  Yes.  Pod father.  
**[1:24:28-1:24:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:24:28):**  I like that.  That's good.  No, I, uh, yeah.  
**[1:24:31-1:24:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:24:31):**  Or he's saying for a, for as going off on that's where you heard it.  Maybe that's where I heard it.  The first time was that they keep the sheep out back to pay for all of it.  
**[1:24:43-1:24:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:24:43):**  The cows around the cows around the horse or cows around the house for the appearances,  for the neighbors and the family.  And they keep the horses out by the road for the tourists and the sheep are out back.  
**[1:24:56-1:25:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:24:56):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's, that's probably, you know, I'd be, it's interesting because I've heard that from  
**[1:25:04-1:25:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:25:04):**  more than one place, this value of sheep and stuff.  You'd I I've wanted to get more sheep guests on, and I cannot find just about anybody who's  got them or has experience with them or has a story to tell about their grandfather building  
**[1:25:17-1:25:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:25:17):**  a ranch with sheep.  There's just not many people out there who actually do it.  So yet it sounds like every ranch was built with them.  
**[1:25:23-1:25:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:25:23):**  So let's put the call out.  If you know, if you can relax story about building a ranch, paying for ranches with  sheep, like that you've heard from your grandfathers, you're, you're still part of an operation  
**[1:25:36-1:25:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:25:36):**  or you have something to say about that.  Reach out to me, reach out to Jared, reach out to Jared over on herd quitter.  Tell those stories.  
**[1:25:44-1:25:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:25:44):**  I've had a lot of requests for sheep episodes, but trying to find sheep producers, guys,  you got to reach out to us.  We'd love to do a platform to tell your stories.  
**[1:25:56-1:25:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:25:56):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's good call.  
**[1:25:59-1:26:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:25:59):**  Yep.  Thank you.  Yeah.  
**[1:26:02-1:26:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:26:02):**  Oh, for sure.  So what did inspire you to get into podcasting?  Well, it was, it was clay and the working cows podcast.  
**[1:26:14-1:26:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:26:14):**  I mean, there was a big part of it.  I always wanted to.  And then I was like, well, if I can find someone that does it, I'll just listen.  
**[1:26:22-1:26:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:26:22):**  I don't really need to do a podcast.  I just want to hear these things and learn.  So I found Clay's podcast and was like, this is great.  
**[1:26:29-1:26:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:26:29):**  You know, went several years.  And then I took this job with SFA and they have a podcast that is, we talked to a lot  of local farmers here in Minnesota that I do quite a few of the interviews on that one  
**[1:26:41-1:26:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:26:41):**  for them and stuff.  And we talked with everything from vegetable farmers to dairy farm to all sorts of stuff.  And that just got me experience in actually doing any sort of a conversation like this.  
**[1:26:53-1:27:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:26:53):**  I had no idea if I could maintain any sort of a conversation.  I didn't, I had no clue how I would do it that.  So after I had a few under my belt with that, I was like, well, this is fun and all, but  
**[1:27:01-1:27:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:27:01):**  I really want to talk to cattlemen and more, you know, all over the country.  And so I had the little bit of experience.  I was confident enough to get started and, and I always wanted to do it.  
**[1:27:12-1:27:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:27:12):**  And so, yeah, at that point I just went ahead and did it.  And yeah, I, I don't remember how I got started.  I talked with Kit Farrow and stuff to see if he had some, I wanted to get him on it  
**[1:27:26-1:27:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:27:26):**  and talk to him a little bit, see if he wanted to participate in it somehow.  And he was open to that.  And so, yeah, we just started going.  
**[1:27:33-1:27:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:27:33):**  And it's been not quite a year now, right around a year.  I don't remember when the first episode was released right around a year ago now.  So we started at the same time.  
**[1:27:43-1:27:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:27:43):**  I know each other.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[1:27:46-1:27:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:27:46):**  I remember Clay saying, saying on his podcast, I had him come on.  It was one of my first and he said that he had got two new ones start and I was like,  well, I know I'm one of them.  
**[1:27:55-1:28:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:27:55):**  Who's the other guy that started right when we did.  Well, it was you.  Well, it was me and then you as he had said, unless there was somebody else.  
**[1:28:04-1:28:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:28:04):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then not too long after that, the ranching or the roots and ruminants came out too.  
**[1:28:11-1:28:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:28:11):**  They do a good one as well.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[1:28:14-1:28:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:28:14):**  I, I don't, I'll admit, I don't catch too many ag podcasts these days because I do one  and I don't always want my content to be derivative.  Yeah.  
**[1:28:24-1:28:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:28:24):**  Yeah.  But I have, I have listened a couple of years.  I listened to a bunch of Clays.  
**[1:28:28-1:28:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:28:28):**  But a lot of times it's just nice to put on Joe Rogan and you know, have a three hour  show, have a three hour show to zone out to.  Yeah, no, I, I, I enjoy his as well.  
**[1:28:40-1:28:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:28:40):**  And it's, yeah, that was something where I was like, how do I want to structure this?  And it was funny because when I first started, I was 30 minutes was fine, you know, 30 to  40 minutes I could get and stuff, but it felt more like I was working for it.  
**[1:28:53-1:29:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:28:53):**  But as you start going into it, these conversations, you throw away the questions and the agenda  and just let a conversation happen.  You can talk for however long, you know, I mean, however long you got time for it.  
**[1:29:05-1:29:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:29:05):**  That's that's never been the issue.  I've got a couple bullet points.  And if I run out of that, I've got a cheat sheet posted on the wall.  
**[1:29:13-1:29:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:29:13):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  I like that.  
**[1:29:16-1:29:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:29:16):**  Yeah.  It's, it's great.  And I don't know, Joe Rogan is a pro at it.  
**[1:29:19-1:29:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:29:19):**  He's got his three hour long every time and stuff and seems to make it seem so effortless.  And I never understood how he can do that.  But once you start, you get the right people having a conversation.  
**[1:29:29-1:29:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:29:29):**  There's endless content.  I mean, you can talk for a long time.  That's that's rarely the issue.  
**[1:29:34-1:29:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:29:34):**  It's Yeah.  Have you been lucky enough to get get the chance to do one of these face to face yet?  No, I well, with my I did one with my dad where I talked to him about our history.  
**[1:29:44-1:29:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:29:44):**  That was the only one I've done in person.  I I'm almost nervous too, because I told dad, if we do another one, he's going to do it  from his computer in his house because I don't have the tech or the know how to do it in  
**[1:29:53-1:30:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:29:53):**  person and I didn't like having one audio file.  So yeah.  Okay, I can understand that I actually I'm really fortunate.  
**[1:30:01-1:30:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:30:01):**  I have a friend that has a like a professional quality podcast studio.  Yeah, let's me use it only takes like 3540 minutes to get there.  Sure.  
**[1:30:12-1:30:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:30:12):**  And he has a restaurant.  So if we're going to schedule a schedule an interview in his studio, always make sure  I take my guest out to have a nice meal at his restaurant.  
**[1:30:23-1:30:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:30:23):**  Maybe the report after.  But he's got some he's got like, the same roadcaster Pro that I do, but he's got different  microphones.  
**[1:30:32-1:30:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:30:32):**  So I just got to take a memory card, pop my settings in, man, we sit down, do the thing.  You know, it's a big table for four mics.  And you know, you kind of get a little bit out of the way, you just kick back and have  
**[1:30:43-1:30:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:30:43):**  a great conversation.  I'm telling you, like, we're sitting here doing this.  And I keep glancing at the clock just to see where we're at.  
**[1:30:51-1:30:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:30:51):**  Doing one in the studio.  Like I look over and it's like, man, we've been doing this forever.  I look over and it's been going for six minutes.  
**[1:30:58-1:31:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:30:58):**  Shit, is this ever gonna get going?  I look over again.  It's like 30.  
**[1:31:03-1:31:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:31:03):**  I'm like, Okay, that's fine.  All right.  We're all here.  
**[1:31:06-1:31:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:31:06):**  Yeah.  In like 10 minutes later, I'm like, All right, we've had a good conversation.  You know, let's see where we're at.  
**[1:31:09-1:31:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:31:09):**  I look over and it's like, 201.  I'm like, Oh, we got an episode boys.  Yeah.  
**[1:31:15-1:31:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:31:15):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, that's, it's always, it's weird.  
**[1:31:19-1:31:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:31:19):**  Even after 55 or whatever, every time I'm still a little nervous beforehand.  Like am I gonna, is this gonna go okay?  Is this gonna be the one where I should have prepared for, you know, but it yeah, after  
**[1:31:31-1:31:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:31:31):**  10, 20, 30 minutes, and they just keep rolling.  But I need to get your tips on that in person, the tech, because that's my biggest fear.  Why I haven't really done it is I actually I should do it before I go to the, you can  
**[1:31:44-1:31:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:31:44):**  get your bell ready, ranching for profit school in April.  There we go.  Before I go to the ranching for profit school in April, so that I can see if I find somebody  
**[1:31:55-1:32:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:31:55):**  with neat stories there and actually talk to him in person is what I would love to do.  But I have no clue how to do it right now.  So yeah, maybe we can get together like, you know, shoot me a text or give me a call.  
**[1:32:04-1:32:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:32:04):**  We can kind of, you know, get together offline so I can see what what equipment you're dealing  with.  And yeah, yeah, yeah, that'd be great there.  
**[1:32:12-1:32:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:32:12):**  So where is that ranching for profit school?  Oklahoma City?  Yeah.  
**[1:32:17-1:32:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:32:17):**  John Locke will be your instructor.  Yeah, yeah, I was supposed to go to Minot with my dad here a couple weeks ago, but I  ended up getting sick.  
**[1:32:24-1:32:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:32:24):**  So I had to stay home and he went off and had all the brain, brain numbing fun, I guess,  of ranching for profit.  Well, you're still going to get John Locke as an instructor.  
**[1:32:35-1:32:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:32:35):**  Yes, he was.  Yep.  He was scheduled for Minot as well.  
**[1:32:38-1:32:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:32:38):**  Mm hmm.  Yeah.  Somebody asked what he did to deserve Minot in February.  
**[1:32:43-1:32:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:32:43):**  And the answer was Phoenix in January.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's, that's probably fair punishment.  
**[1:32:50-1:32:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:32:50):**  Yeah.  For those that don't know, John was on podcast previously camera the episodes off top my  head.  
**[1:32:57-1:33:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:32:57):**  Jamie's not here to look it up.  But John is from southwest of Houston, Texas.  John does not like the cold.  
**[1:33:06-1:33:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:33:06):**  The opposite of North Dakota.  Yes.  Yeah.  
**[1:33:10-1:33:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:33:10):**  John is not a man that is made to enjoy cold weather.  And he will tell you that himself.  Yeah.  
**[1:33:14-1:33:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:33:14):**  Yeah.  No, I can't blame a person.  But at the same time, I also have zero desire to be in South Texas in the summer.  
**[1:33:22-1:33:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:33:22):**  So I would probably take Minnesota winter over that for sure.  Or that but for sure, anywhere south east with the humidity.  I do not know how they can do it.  
**[1:33:33-1:33:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:33:33):**  And I, I'm pretty sure I would have a heart attack year one.  So drink a lot of water.  I'm told.  
**[1:33:40-1:33:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:33:40):**  Yeah, yeah.  For sure.  For sure.  
**[1:33:43-1:33:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:33:43):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[1:33:46-1:33:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:33:46):**  So I want to hear about a wreck.  Tell me about a wreck you've had and what did it teach you?  On our on our farm?  
**[1:33:53-1:33:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:33:53):**  Yeah.  Farm ranch cow.  Okay.  
**[1:33:56-1:34:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:33:56):**  Yeah, the closest thing I can think of and I feel bad because it happened on another  person's farm with our cattle and stuff is the the so we we want to extend our grazing  season right.  
**[1:34:12-1:34:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:34:12):**  So we were having really expensive winter feed costs.  And so we started planting sorghum, sedan grass on our farm and doing a couple years  of trials with that to see what we could do.  
**[1:34:20-1:34:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:34:20):**  And we were getting when we planted a cool season cover crop mix in the spring, hated  off, and then gray and then planted sorghum, sedan grass mix and graze that in the fall  and winter, we we were getting 180 plus cow days per acre that we were able to harvest  
**[1:34:36-1:34:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:34:36):**  off of that.  And when we divided out our cost per cow day, it was well below well below our cost per  cow day of feeding hay was and we did this and it went quite well for several years.  
**[1:34:48-1:35:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:34:48):**  And so then we we had this farmer that we we still graze stocks on this place every  year great friend really progressive crop farmer, no till cover crops doing fantastic  stuff on really heavy wet ground.  
**[1:35:02-1:35:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:35:02):**  And he wanted to get livestock integration on his farm and we wanted to kind of access  more acres potentially to raise crops.  And so we thought here might be a mutually beneficial way that we can pay him to raise  
**[1:35:13-1:35:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:35:13):**  a cool season mix make hay on it, put a sorghum sedan grass mix in and graze that in the winter.  And so we went over to his place with our cattle in October, grazed corn stocks on it,  as long as we could graze corn stocks and then with the plan being to go to the sorghum  
**[1:35:27-1:35:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:35:27):**  sedan grass after the corn stocks when the snow was too thick or deep for the the the  corn stocks.  Well, by the time we got to the sorghum sedan the snow it got really that that sorghum caught  
**[1:35:40-1:35:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:35:40):**  a lot of snow and it seemed like by the time we got off the corn stocks because it was  too hard on the cattle.  The the sorghum sedan was buried in snow and ice and they got 30 counties per acre off  
**[1:35:52-1:36:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:35:52):**  of that.  And so we felt pretty bad because he had all the costs of what would have produced 180  plus power days per acre, but he had to divide it across, we paid him on a per head per day  
**[1:36:03-1:36:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:36:03):**  basis kind of a thing and we ended up trying to make it work, but he kind of lost a lot  of production out of that because it was all buried in snow and ice.  And we if we had gotten the full hundred and eighty to two hundred counties, it would have  
**[1:36:17-1:36:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:36:17):**  been a really good setup for him where he got paid a fair price, we got a significantly  reduced cost for our winter feed costs.  We don't have to run the sorghum on our own acres so we could increase our pasture acres,  
**[1:36:27-1:36:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:36:27):**  run more cows and kind of increase turnover.  It was gonna be we were really excited about the mutual benefit between it all and stuff,  but it ended up being a total flop with that sorghum when we were grazing in the middle  
**[1:36:37-1:36:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:36:37):**  of February and it was buried in snow and ice and we barely got anything off of it.  That's probably the biggest one I can think of.  So if somebody was sitting in, let's just pick a town, LA in a filing cabinet for humans,  
**[1:36:55-1:37:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:36:55):**  what would be some advice that you could throw their way if they wanted to do what we're  doing?  What's the what would be the best advice you wish you had before you started in your ag  
**[1:37:05-1:37:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:37:05):**  career?  Man, like, to that point, I was fortunate to have my dad who'd been doing this for years.  So I started off a lot better off than a lot of folks.  
**[1:37:16-1:37:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:37:16):**  I was fortunate to have that.  But as far as advice to beginners with cattle production specifically is, I mean, especially  if you're getting started, don't jump in with all the things you think you need.  
**[1:37:30-1:37:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:37:30):**  I mean, how many people get started buying a tractor, buying a hay rack and hay equipment  and all that stuff you need to feed you think you need to feed cattle and stuff.  I mean, that's a one advantage of a grazing based system is that you can get into it with  
**[1:37:43-1:37:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:37:43):**  little or no overhead.  I mean, you can get into it without the equipment.  So don't try and be the crop farmer.  
**[1:37:49-1:37:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:37:49):**  That's the reason why a lot of people start off with grazing enterprises as opposed to  cropping appears because they can't afford to get all the crop and equipment.  So don't try and play their game.  
**[1:37:57-1:38:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:37:57):**  Just let the animals do their own work.  And then and then call ruthlessly if you can.  Yeah, I don't want to say that necessarily entirely is like a blanket statement, you  
**[1:38:07-1:38:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:38:07):**  should pull out all the stops and call ruthlessly because that could be financially destructive  for a lot of people too.  So you know, you got to work with what you got and try and, you know, make it work but  
**[1:38:16-1:38:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:38:16):**  work towards reducing inputs, pulling out the crutches, selecting the animals that work  and I just had a fantastic conversation last two weeks ago now with Jason Sargrove, who  talked about kind of a philosophy we were trying to kind of come up with like, what  
**[1:38:29-1:38:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:38:29):**  are the principles like the principles of soil health they talk about?  What are the principles of profitable cattle production and stuff and he said, like one  of the ones for cows would be to call, improve genetics, not from buying better bulls, but  
**[1:38:41-1:38:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:38:41):**  from calling out the worst and, you know, let the environment select and I was like,  that's a really kind of revolutionary thought, not revolutionary, I shouldn't say that but  very, very insightful thought, you know, I mean, improve your herd genetics, not through  
**[1:38:53-1:39:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:38:53):**  selecting and better genetics, but getting rid of the worst ones.  And you're heard in time will just become this group of cattle that fit beautifully  in your environment.  
**[1:39:02-1:39:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:39:02):**  And that's totally backwards from everything we read in the publications and the mainstream  podcast which is, yeah, you can improve your profitability with this bull or you know,  this breed is proven profit this or use this app to track your feed and track your cost  
**[1:39:18-1:39:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:39:18):**  and you'll make more money or use this implant to improve this.  Like yeah, why don't we just take out the crap out of a herd that ain't working that's  hold the rest of them down?  
**[1:39:28-1:39:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:39:28):**  Yeah, yeah.  Well, I hear it all the time of just like, well, gosh, you got so I talked about a really  good read back on our cows in 93 to 95% for several years.  
**[1:39:39-1:39:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:39:39):**  The heifers ain't so pretty.  The heifers, the yearling heifers is 70 to 75%, and maybe 80% on a good year.  And people are saying you could get 90 95%.  
**[1:39:51-1:40:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:39:51):**  You know, if you did this, or you added this, or you supplemented with that.  It's like I would much rather have an open heifer than an open four year old, or five  year old, you know, I mean, when we're calling them out at the beginning, we're setting up  
**[1:40:04-1:40:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:40:04):**  our herd so much better at the start for long term, you know, stability, because we've weeded  out the ones that can't do it early on.  And I'm okay with that, too, because the other I mean, we, my wife and I direct market meat,  
**[1:40:15-1:40:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:40:15):**  so we just grass finish them and sell them for more than we could as you get good money,  grass market or grass finishing beef too.  So you can get a premium form, but it's a lot harder to do that with an open five year  
**[1:40:26-1:40:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:40:26):**  old, then you got a sale barn cow that's worth, you know, a fraction of what she could be.  So those are the ones you guys have a grinder and sell for five bucks as burger.  That's what that's the thing we want to look for is wholesale burger markets or beef stick  
**[1:40:43-1:40:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:40:43):**  markets, something we can capture out of our cows.  That's what we would like to do.  The other thing that we're considering after going to Doug Ferguson sell by marketing school,  
**[1:40:53-1:41:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:40:53):**  you know, and Wally Olson talks about it a lot too is, you know, that cows don't appreciate  in a straight line, they drop off, you know, year four or five.  So keeping the younger herd selling them earlier.  
**[1:41:02-1:41:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:41:02):**  We don't have much fallout that early.  I mean, after we get the heavy fallout early, we don't have that much after there.  So we don't really have that many cows to sell at a sales barn.  
**[1:41:14-1:41:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:41:14):**  So it's not that much of a hit.  And usually, if we're calling at that point, we're calling out ones that are bred that  not opens.  
**[1:41:24-1:41:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:41:24):**  But there's always a few and so far, we've just gone to the sales barn with them.  But I would like to, we've been looking at beef sticks as kind of our cull cow market.  Yeah, yeah, I'm with you.  
**[1:41:36-1:41:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:41:36):**  I'm on that level.  It's just trying to find that pipeline and trying to get that pipeline built.  It's not easy.  
**[1:41:43-1:41:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:41:43):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, yeah, you hear about the pros.  
**[1:41:48-1:41:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:41:48):**  There's a lot of people out there have done an amazing job.  And I when I first started the podcast, I had a guest from Georgia.  And somebody reached out and said, I love this.  
**[1:41:56-1:42:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:41:56):**  You got somebody from the southeast who's not Will Harris.  Well, just this morning, I released Will Harris.  And because I've wanted to talk to him forever.  
**[1:42:06-1:42:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:42:06):**  But that person, I think I reached, talked to him or something.  And they said, you know, at least if you're going to talk to Will Harris, talk more about  the struggles like early on, you know, it doesn't really do anybody any good to hear  
**[1:42:15-1:42:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:42:15):**  of this guy doing 20 million in sales and all how great this is and how fantastic that  is and stuff, you know, hear about how he did it.  And so that we tried to talk a lot early on about what were the actual challenges and  
**[1:42:25-1:42:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:42:25):**  how did you overcome them?  Because that's, it's not easy.  I mean, it sounds great.  
**[1:42:30-1:42:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:42:30):**  Just go sell everything direct.  But when you get to doing it, you realize the time commitment and the infrastructure  requirements and everything just to move a head of beef to a consumer is not cheap or  
**[1:42:42-1:42:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:42:42):**  easy.  And labor requirements.  It's a lot easier to grow them than it is to sell them.  
**[1:42:48-1:42:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:42:48):**  Yeah.  Gosh, I can't remember.  I listen to so much stuff.  
**[1:42:53-1:43:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:42:53):**  But we're listening to one about, you know, that the producers have just willingly given  up all of our marketing power.  And it's true.  
**[1:43:01-1:43:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:43:01):**  We let, you know, they sold the checkoff to all the producers back in the 80s.  I didn't vote on it.  You didn't vote on it.  
**[1:43:10-1:43:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:43:10):**  But we're still paying it.  Yeah, they sold us the checkoff as saying, guys, we know you don't have time to market  your stuff.  
**[1:43:18-1:43:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:43:18):**  Let us do that for you.  Good stuff, right?  And at the time, I'm sure it was a great thing.  
**[1:43:26-1:43:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:43:26):**  And I'm sure that it worked well for a while.  But history has proved that ever since the checkoff has been put into place, the cattleman  share of the beef dollar has done nothing but go down.  
**[1:43:38-1:43:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:43:38):**  Yeah, well, I think it's you that maybe said it or one of your guests.  This conversation is one that I hear mostly I feel like from your podcast.  But how many cattlemen are actually selling beef?  
**[1:43:53-1:43:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:43:53):**  We're not.  We're not selling beef.  We're selling cattle.  
**[1:43:56-1:44:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:43:56):**  And yet the checkoff is selling their marketing beef.  They're not marketing our cattle.  And so we're paying them to market the packers product.  
**[1:44:04-1:44:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:44:04):**  We're paying them for their own advertising.  Like we're giving them their advertising budget.  Like when was the last time you saw Tyson brand advertising one of their protein products?  
**[1:44:19-1:44:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:44:19):**  They don't have to because we paid advertise it for them through the checkoff.  We don't have Tyson, Cargill, JBS, Marfrag, Smithfield.  They don't have to do anything to tell us how good the meat is.  
**[1:44:35-1:44:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:44:35):**  They don't have to do any marketing.  Because we paid a quote independent third party to do that.  And 100% I'm in the cattle business.  
**[1:44:49-1:45:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:44:49):**  I want to be in the beef business.  But I don't want to sell cattle to somebody that's in the beef business.  Because let's face it, no matter what we take to the barn, they're paying us hamburger price.  
**[1:45:01-1:45:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:45:01):**  They're paying us hamburger price and selling it for steak.  Bottom line.  And it wraps back around to that they base these grids and formulas on the quote cash  
**[1:45:16-1:45:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:45:16):**  trade.  While the overall volume of cash trade is so small and they control it anyway, they're  basically continuing to manipulate the price further and further down on all these grid  
**[1:45:30-1:45:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:45:30):**  and formula contracts and importing quote lean trim from Brazil.  Like bullshit.  We import more than we export.  
**[1:45:40-1:45:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:45:40):**  Yeah.  Well, it's interesting because I kind of it's a challenge.  No doubt.  
**[1:45:47-1:45:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:45:47):**  But you and I talked to people all over the country who are making a profitable business  out of cattle and on grass.  And so it's not in the commodity markets too.  
**[1:45:59-1:46:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:45:59):**  And so it's no doubt is there challenges.  No doubt is that maybe making things difficult and stuff too.  But I think there's definitely ways that people can work with it, at least in the time.  
**[1:46:11-1:46:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:46:11):**  And that's kind of what we're trying to do is do things differently.  I mean, yeah, you maybe can't compete with the guys with at the you can't compete with  guys in the kind of more large scale feedlot type systems.  
**[1:46:26-1:46:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:46:26):**  You maybe can't get into this business and compete with them and stuff, but you don't  need to I mean, you can go the more low input route and be profitable from cow one, and  then scale a profitable enterprise.  
**[1:46:35-1:46:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:46:35):**  And that's, I don't know, it's, it's interesting.  I'd like I like Doug Ferguson, when I went to his class, spent like two hours talking  to us about kind of this idea of our mindset and not being the victim and that we can choose  
**[1:46:51-1:47:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:46:51):**  we can be profitable in this industry if we do things differently.  And I do believe that.  But no doubt are there challenges too.  
**[1:47:01-1:47:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:47:01):**  It also needs to be said that there's I don't think that the person needs to feel guilty  about taking advantage of the system the way it exists.  But on the other side of that coin is as long as there's, you know, desire to seek knowledge  
**[1:47:21-1:47:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:47:21):**  to do better.  Yeah.  You know, there's a lot of guys that I know that are in the cattle business that just  
**[1:47:31-1:47:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:47:31):**  can't take their entire cattle business and shift it to a beef business, you know, thousand  head operations.  It doesn't make sense for somebody to do that.  
**[1:47:40-1:47:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:47:40):**  And I'll admit that, like, if you're that guy, it doesn't make sense for you to take  everything you've been doing.  And those really high quality cattle that are in high demand at the feedlot at the sale  
**[1:47:51-1:48:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:47:51):**  barn, it doesn't make sense to try to shift all that demand over over to direct sell,  take a percentage of it, select a couple of animals out of that, retain them, and put  those put your name on those and start building your brand, instead of giving away the best  
**[1:48:10-1:48:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:48:10):**  of yourself and the best of your genetics for Tyson to put their label on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[1:48:17-1:48:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:48:17):**  And I like that.  I don't know when this will be released.  But last week, I think you released the one with George Walker.  
**[1:48:23-1:48:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:48:23):**  And they've done an amazing job of marketing.  They're doing so good with direct marketing and building out their brand and stuff, too.  But he also was talking about their like the challenges that come with it.  
**[1:48:33-1:48:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:48:33):**  And I have a lot of people who come to me more with my job with SFA and asking how can  we you know, we want to do this direct marketing, it sounds fantastic and stuff to maybe coming  in a little ambitious and, and there's some real challenges to that as well.  
**[1:48:47-1:48:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:48:47):**  But the reward is there.  But yeah, there's some real reward and opportunity.  And long term, the guys who have their own market, I feel like are going to be I mean,  
**[1:48:59-1:49:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:48:59):**  you just have this whole level of control that no one else will ever be able to have  long term if you can control your market from beginning to end, especially the guys who  are big enough to have their own processing line and stuff to that's where things kind  
**[1:49:09-1:49:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:49:09):**  of get exciting.  And I like with Will Harris, where he talked about that 100% of the consumer dollar comes  to him in Bluffton, Georgia.  
**[1:49:16-1:49:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:49:16):**  And he asked a lot of expenses that go out with that, that go to the pack and to the  all the employee, the 180 employees who are saw the stuff, but 100% of that dollar rather  than going to the 50,000 headfeed lot in Nebraska or the pack or wherever stays in Bluffton,  
**[1:49:31-1:49:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:49:31):**  Georgia, in his community.  How cool is that?  I mean, when you start building, you can build communities with cattle.  
**[1:49:37-1:49:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:49:37):**  I mean, that's where things get exciting.  I love that cows build towns and that's correct Steve Stratford quote.  Yeah, you know, that's a hill that I'll die on shoulder to shoulder with them cows build  
**[1:49:49-1:50:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:49:49):**  towns Will Harris has Will Harris has a model.  And I'm not saying that it's 100% correct, or will work everywhere.  But it is a good model.  
**[1:50:00-1:50:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:50:00):**  It is a good framework for people to look at and say, if he can do that Bluffton, Georgia,  I can do something similar in Yankton, South Dakota, or Phoenix, Arizona, or Seattle, Washington,  like 80% of it's gonna be common.  
**[1:50:14-1:50:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:50:14):**  80% of it's gonna be replicatable and will work somewhere else.  It's just finding that 20% that you need to get there to just make it sing.  Yeah, yeah.  
**[1:50:26-1:50:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:50:26):**  No, exactly.  And there's totally potential there's, I don't know.  We just did a search within 20 miles of the center where we have a freezer space in the  
**[1:50:37-1:50:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:50:37):**  Twin Cities, where we market our meat out of and we just kind of looked 20 miles around  Edina, and there's like 3 million people or something in the Twin Cities.  And it's like, why am I trying to there's so many people who want my product within  
**[1:50:54-1:51:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:50:54):**  an hour for me.  I mean, this opportunity is great.  And we hear from so many customers, oh, we've been looking for someone like you for so long.  
**[1:51:02-1:51:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:51:02):**  And it's like, they're out there.  They are everywhere.  Just got to get in front of them somehow.  
**[1:51:07-1:51:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:51:07):**  That's the challenge.  Figuring out how to connect the story that we want to tell to the consumer that wants  to hear it.  
**[1:51:18-1:51:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:51:18):**  That has been a challenge.  Like I said, I got out of the Navy in 06 and came back and it was really around 07, 08.  I started to kind of really get my head around some of these things.  
**[1:51:31-1:51:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:51:31):**  If you want to sell grass fed, trying to sell grass fed 10 years ago was an uphill battle.  I mean, if you're trying to sell grass fed beef, everybody's laughing at you.  Nobody's listening.  
**[1:51:43-1:51:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:51:43):**  Now people are at least listening.  And there's less people that fight you on it.  And there's more people seeking you out.  
**[1:51:49-1:51:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:51:49):**  Yeah.  And I don't know where I was going with that.  I don't know either.  
**[1:51:56-1:52:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:51:56):**  But it's, it's, it is interesting, like talking to these guys like Will Harris and Seven Sons  in Indiana and stuff.  They were the early ones on in like the early 2000s when no one else was doing it.  
**[1:52:06-1:52:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:52:06):**  The technology wasn't out there.  But they also had a wide open market.  So I kind of wonder, I don't know where I'd rather be.  
**[1:52:12-1:52:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:52:12):**  Would I rather be here where there's an awareness of the benefits of grass fed, you know, the  benefits of what we do?  And there's the tools like, you know, all the tools there are for marketing and like  
**[1:52:21-1:52:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:52:21):**  the all this or would I rather be back there where there was no market, no tools, but no  competition.  That's no, yeah, there's advantages to each, I guess.  
**[1:52:33-1:52:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:52:33):**  I don't think we missed it.  I think it's still coming.  Yeah.  
**[1:52:37-1:52:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:52:37):**  Yeah.  Do you know, is there a stat out there?  I've wondered, is there a stat that says actually how what percent of beef is purchased direct?  
**[1:52:44-1:52:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:52:44):**  I've never seen one, but I wondered.  No, I don't.  I don't know.  
**[1:52:49-1:52:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:52:49):**  And I will, how would you track that?  I'd be interested to see.  I have no idea.  
**[1:52:53-1:53:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:52:53):**  I don't even for me to figure out that's for her.  I don't even believe the official USDA harvest statistics.  Like, yeah, yeah, you know, they come, you know, they come from the big packing plants.  
**[1:53:04-1:53:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:53:04):**  I don't even believe that bullshit.  But that would be something very interesting, very interesting to know, but I don't, you  know, what, what kind of data data collection would that require?  
**[1:53:17-1:53:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:53:17):**  And I'd be curious, probably the best way to do it, I suppose would be to go to like  the, the Gray's carts, the barn doors, the, you know, the companies that are actually  like the interview, they probably have the numbers, but maybe that's illegal to share  
**[1:53:29-1:53:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:53:29):**  that data.  I don't know.  I mean, I just, if we were, say 1%, let's say 1% of the whole population or the meat  
**[1:53:37-1:53:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:53:37):**  is direct marketed or something like that.  I'd be curious then to how COVID affected that, you know, it would for sure went up  to go 2%.  
**[1:53:45-1:53:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:53:45):**  Yeah.  I mean, it's like, it could have totally doubled it, but it's still such this minor fraction.  You know, we could have doubled the direct marketing, you know, of the country went from  
**[1:53:55-1:54:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:53:55):**  1% to 2% maybe, but it's still this tiny fraction of the whole industry.  Like there's so much potential in this direct marketing yet.  And everybody who buys beef or go ahead, let's look at it this way.  
**[1:54:07-1:54:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:54:07):**  Okay.  So once an idea takes hold in 3% of the population, it's basically unstoppable.  So if we get 3% of the population on direct marketing, grass fed beef, that's unstoppable  
**[1:54:21-1:54:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:54:21):**  momentum and that movement and that, that demographic will do nothing but continue to  grow.  Yeah.  
**[1:54:28-1:54:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:54:28):**  And what if it's not even just grass fed beef?  Like if we want to just support local communities, I mean, if it's every, if every kind of beef,  it can be grain fed beef, grass fed, all natural, whatever.  
**[1:54:38-1:54:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:54:38):**  But if they, if they supported local, you can have the same impact on communities that  that Will Harris is having without, you know, meeting the grass.  I mean, you can still get the same quality product at a reasonable price too.  
**[1:54:49-1:55:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:54:49):**  I mean, the people selling direct market or grain fed beef, I don't know, one, $2 more  per pound or something like that.  And the average consumer eats 44 pounds of beef a year.  
**[1:55:01-1:55:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:55:01):**  So I mean, you're talking 100 pounds more per pound.  Yeah.  From one of my friends that produces high quality beef, since I don't have my pipeline  
**[1:55:12-1:55:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:55:12):**  built yet, I will happily pay whatever they ask.  And it's usually 50% over the grocery store, but you end up with more food in the pan after  you cook it.  
**[1:55:24-1:55:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:55:24):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[1:55:27-1:55:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:55:27):**  You end up with more nutrition in the pan after you cook it.  Yeah.  And if, and if you do that, say it's four bucks a pound more and the average person  
**[1:55:37-1:55:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:55:37):**  needs 50 pounds per year, whatever you're talking $200 or yeah.  Am I right on that?  Yeah.  
**[1:55:43-1:55:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:55:43):**  That seems like not very much.  $200 more in meat costs and beef costs.  But I can't afford to eat pelvic because I need a new pair of Jordans or I need the latest  
**[1:55:52-1:56:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:55:52):**  iPhone.  I mean, Netflix, that's my Netflix or my monthly, my daily Starbucks and stuff.  I mean, it's like the, the, the investment costs we're asking the consumer to make is  
**[1:56:00-1:56:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:56:00):**  relatively small, but the impact is massive.  The potential impact.  It's and it's, it would be just a few small investments every day.  
**[1:56:11-1:56:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:56:11):**  Yeah.  That would pay dividends far down the line in human health.  I mean, we wouldn't have these, we wouldn't have as many late onset cases of diabetes  
**[1:56:24-1:56:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:56:24):**  if we got rid of carbs and seed oils out of our diet.  You know, maybe we wouldn't have some of these health problems if we weren't eating a lot  of this, you know, I'm going to say you're going to disagree with me and that's fine,  
**[1:56:37-1:56:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:56:37):**  but a lot of grain fed cattle that have been fed a lot of GMO grains that have been sprayed  with a lot of herbicide and pesticides.  Yeah.  
**[1:56:45-1:56:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:56:45):**  You know, I'm sure that I will get flamed for saying that there's some kind of herbicide  and pesticide residue that makes it in that grain that builds up in that cow.  Like it's there.  
**[1:56:56-1:57:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:56:56):**  It might not be a detectable quantity.  And just because science says, Oh, well that can't happen.  I point to the neonicotinoids.  
**[1:57:03-1:57:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:57:03):**  Like they have proven that neonicotinoids will kill honeybees and wasps in quantities  so small, we can't even measure them.  Yeah.  
**[1:57:16-1:57:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:57:16):**  Yeah.  Well, and yeah, I'm not going to disagree with you.  I mean, we raise grass hush beef.  
**[1:57:22-1:57:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:57:22):**  We believe in the benefits of that and stuff too.  But you know, yeah, it's interesting if we could shift more that way, that would be incredible.  And I, Joel Soliton has talked about, I've heard people talk about and stuff too, that  
**[1:57:35-1:57:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:57:35):**  we have the capacity to raise all of the beef that we raise right now on grass.  And maybe we do, maybe we don't.  I don't know, there needs to be some for both.  
**[1:57:42-1:57:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:57:42):**  And there's always going to be a market for green finished beef out of, you know, afford,  they need the cheapness and the other people who just prefer that meat and stuff.  But I like, I love the idea of this more local and stuff too.  
**[1:57:55-1:58:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:57:55):**  And it's going to cost more.  But people always say that they're against that cost.  And I really question whether the idea of cheap food is really doing anybody any favors.  
**[1:58:07-1:58:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:58:07):**  Okay.  Let's pay the extra cost to the rancher that's taking care of his land, that's managing it  regeneratively that keeps the soil covered and has a diverse mix of species in his pastures  
**[1:58:19-1:58:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:58:19):**  that has clean, clear streams running off the ranch and ponds that you can see the bottom  of that are full of fish.  Okay.  
**[1:58:28-1:58:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:58:28):**  Let's not give that guy a premium because that's too much.  Let's go to the meat case at Walmart and buy the cheapest fucking thing we can.  It's just responsible for all manner of environmental destruction.  
**[1:58:42-1:58:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:58:42):**  And guys, please don't think I'm attaching the production beef system.  But let's be honest.  There's some problems.  
**[1:58:49-1:59:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:58:49):**  Like there's some serious problems when you look at the production Kefoe model from the  30,000 foot view, you know, our cows to blame for rainforest destruction in Brazil.  Not directly, but yeah, they're clearing rainforest to grow corn and soybeans to feed cows and  
**[1:59:05-1:59:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:59:05):**  fucking feed lots in Brazil so they can ship them up here.  So is our demand for animal agriculture feeding rainforest destruction in a roundabout way?  Yes.  
**[1:59:15-1:59:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:59:15):**  But the average cattleman that I'm near or you're near would argue that till they're  blue in the face.  Cows don't cause climate destruction.  
**[1:59:23-1:59:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:59:23):**  Nobody's cutting down the rainforest to grow cows.  And they're right.  They're just cutting it down to grow cow feed because the cows are staying in a Kefoe.  
**[1:59:32-1:59:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:59:32):**  And it honestly, that's not much different.  You know, if we're going to cut down a rainforest to do something for cows, let's put cows on  it.  
**[1:59:40-1:59:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:59:40):**  Yeah, no, it's interesting.  It's a conversation we could talk to, you know, like another two hours.  Easy.  
**[1:59:50-2:00:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=1:59:50):**  I mean, there's so much you could get into with this.  We have been going two hours and something that I've heard said, and I don't repeat it  very often is, and I wish I could remember who said it, but east of the Mississippi can  
**[2:00:07-2:00:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=2:00:07):**  raise 100% of the cattle that we need in this country.  There's enough grazing land and enough rainfall that we don't even need to be west of the  Mississippi with cows.  
**[2:00:16-2:00:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=2:00:16):**  Interesting.  Yeah.  Well, I'm sure that's true.  
**[2:00:21-2:00:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=2:00:21):**  And I suppose what people say then would be, well, all of that ground would be the grain  production ground.  And so where would all the stuff that grain production is going to, what would we do with  
**[2:00:33-2:00:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=2:00:33):**  that?  But 40, 30, 35% of that or so goes to livestock feed, although that's also including pork  and poultry.  
**[2:00:40-2:00:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=2:00:40):**  But another 35, 40% of that goes to ethanol production.  You know, I mean, is that really doing us any favors either and stuff?  I mean, yeah.  
**[2:00:47-2:00:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=2:00:47):**  Oh, ethanol is a two hour podcast.  Not with me.  I don't know enough about that.  
**[2:00:54-2:01:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=2:00:54):**  But on ethanol, I have no idea.  I saw on Twitter, and I always get a kick out of it on Twitter.  And I don't really care one way or another or something myself, but people who are just  
**[2:01:07-2:01:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=2:01:07):**  100% against solar, solar arrays.  And they were saying how this is, you know, what a waste, all this productive ground will  never be back in corn or something like that.  
**[2:01:18-2:01:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=2:01:18):**  I just doing some Google searching.  And I have  Probably doing a better benefit to the world with solar panels on it than it was with corn.  
**[2:01:27-2:01:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=2:01:27):**  Yeah, well, I was just looking at purely from a car, like how many miles and I looked how  many miles can you get out of an acre of solar electricity harvested versus an acre of corn  used for ethanol.  
**[2:01:39-2:01:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=2:01:39):**  And I don't remember the number.  It was ridiculously wildly more with solar.  So you can harvest so many more miles in a car in an automobile with that.  
**[2:01:51-2:01:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=2:01:51):**  And then they would say, well, what about all the byproducts you can get, you know,  feed out of grain?  Well, it's like you can graze under solar panels too.  
**[2:01:57-2:02:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=2:01:57):**  So it's still feed.  It's also miles and energy.  And I was just like, I don't know, I'm not, I'm very non confrontational.  
**[2:02:04-2:02:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=2:02:04):**  So and I'm probably gonna get something back from all this and stuff too.  But so I didn't respond on that Twitter, but as it may be the sources I saw were wildly  off too.  
**[2:02:14-2:02:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=2:02:14):**  But I mean, if you can increase more of the fuel, essentially, I mean, why are we raising  all this corn to go into fuel, it's a pretty inefficient system in itself.  And then we can also use it for agricultural purposes and grazing and actually get paid  
**[2:02:29-2:02:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=2:02:29):**  to graze.  A lot of these solar arrays will pay like a vegetation management fee to somebody to  graze.  
**[2:02:37-2:02:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=2:02:37):**  I mean, this is in the landowner.  Hopefully it's, you know, somebody's rural and not some, you know, city person buying  up land across the country, but the landowner gets a pretty pretty penny as well for this,  
**[2:02:48-2:02:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=2:02:48):**  I mean, for the rent payments.  So it can be a win win, and that's a lot of money coming into that local community.  So I don't know, there's, there's a lot of different ways to do things that people are  
**[2:02:57-2:03:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=2:02:57):**  willing to think a little differently and challenge their own paradigms and be willing  to say, not that I need to change tomorrow, but is what I'm doing the best thing that  we could do in this situation?  
**[2:03:09-2:03:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=2:03:09):**  I don't know.  I like it.  I like it.  
**[2:03:14-2:03:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=2:03:14):**  Yeah.  We're bumping on that two hour mark, bud.  Yeah.  
**[2:03:19-2:03:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=2:03:19):**  We'll go another two hours on my podcast with you then.  So yeah, yeah, definitely will have to do that.  Yeah.  
**[2:03:26-2:03:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=2:03:26):**  Yeah.  I think I said, I might regret saying this, but I'm going to try to have this one out,  I think on the 14th.  
**[2:03:34-2:03:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=2:03:34):**  Okay.  Cool.  Cool.  
**[2:03:37-2:03:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=2:03:37):**  So if you just heard that on the podcast, and it came out on a different day, make sure  you send me some hate mail.  Let me know.  
**[2:03:44-2:03:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=2:03:44):**  I was gonna say, and if I'm no longer on Twitter, because somebody, I don't know.  Somebody heard me in my crop country here go after corn production.  I might be in trouble too.  
**[2:03:54-2:03:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=2:03:54):**  I've got your phone number now.  Don't be afraid to get kicked off Twitter.  Oh, good.  
**[2:03:59-2:04:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=2:03:59):**  No, good.  I appreciate it.  That was fun.  
**[2:04:05-2:04:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=2:04:05):**  You're good at keeping conversation going too.  This was this two hours flew by.  Thanks, Brian.  
**[2:04:10-2:04:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=2:04:10):**  Hey, I'm just faking it till I make it.  Where can we find you on social media?  How can people get ahold of you?  
**[2:04:16-2:04:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=2:04:16):**  Where can I find your excellent Heardquitter podcast?  Yeah.  So Jared Lumen on Facebook and Instagram, Heardquitter podcast, Facebook, Instagram.  
**[2:04:26-2:04:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=2:04:26):**  Yeah, that's where you can find me.  I'm not too active on either.  I respond to messages, but I don't post too much.  
**[2:04:32-2:04:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=2:04:32):**  So that's where you can find me.  Yeah, thanks.  What's your podcast host platform?  
**[2:04:37-2:04:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=2:04:37):**  Anchor.  You're on Anchor too?  Okay, sweet.

**[2:04:47-2:04:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=2:04:47):**  I should have mentioned that as well.  I'm not listening to it pretty much on any Where We Listen podcast, I guess.  I'm still learning how to do all that self-promotion.  
**[2:04:57-2:05:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=2:04:57):**  I'm still pretty rough at it too.  We'll get better.  Yeah, yeah, hopefully.  
**[2:05:02-2:05:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=2:05:02):**  Well, man, it's been an awesome afternoon hanging out with you, Jared.  I'm really looking forward to meeting back up with you in a couple of weeks and your  show and continuing this great conversation.  
**[2:05:13-2:05:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=2:05:13):**  Yeah, for sure.  Me too.  Like I said earlier, there's a million questions I got for you that we'll have to do that  
**[2:05:20-2:05:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=2:05:20):**  on mine so you can be in the hot seat next time.  Looking forward to it.  Awesome.

**[2:05:32-2:05:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=2:05:32):**  Yeah.  All right, guys.  Well, thanks so much for sticking around.  
**[2:05:35-2:05:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=2:05:35):**  We'll see you next week.  Yeah.  Gosh.  
**[2:05:38-2:05:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/55-Jared-Luhman-Breeding-the-Tough-ones-e1fkloe#t=2:05:38):**  Yeah.  Bye.

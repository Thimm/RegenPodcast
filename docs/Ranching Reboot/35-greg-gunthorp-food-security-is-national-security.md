This week we've got a really great guest for you.  He's got four generations of experienced, pasture finishing hogs.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:01:03):**  He sells to Charlie Trotter's World Famous in Chicago.  We talk about truth in labeling and then we tackle one of our favorite subjects on the  Ranching Reboot podcast, meat packer concentration.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:01:14):**  We talk about the velocity of money and how food security is national security.  Today's guest is Greg Gunthorpe.  Welcome Greg to the show.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:01:22):**  Greg, welcome to the show and we'll just start off like we really haven't met.  We've just exchanged a little bit over Twitter.  So why don't you go ahead and tell us about yourself a little bit.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:01:36):**  Sure.  Great to be on today.  Greg Gunthorpe, my family, wife and son, we own Gunthorpe Farms in LaGrange, Indiana.  
**[0:01:49-0:02:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:01:49):**  I grew up on a diversified crop and livestock farm.  My parents still own it, butts up to our farm.  About a 600 acre corn, soybeans, wheat, alfalfa, actual diversified crop and livestock farm,  
**[0:02:07-0:02:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:02:07):**  finished some cattle until 1985.  My family's farrowed pigs on pasture for at least four generations.  Hold them on the commodity market until 1998.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:02:22):**  Just a few years before that, 94, my wife and I just newly married.  My dad said that the hog market was done for the independent small hog farmer.  Said that it's time to sell the sows.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:02:40):**  I said I wasn't ready to quit raising hogs.  And so me and my wife went off on our own.  1998 found out my dad was right.  
**[0:02:49-0:03:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:02:49):**  The market for the independent hog farmer was done.  My wife and I sold live pigs for less than what my grandpa sold them for in the Depression.  We netted five cents a pound on one pot load of hogs by the time they took trucking and  
**[0:03:03-0:03:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:03:03):**  insurance and docked us.  And what little equity we had, we lost in 98.  And I still said that I'm not ready to be done raising pigs.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:03:14):**  And I said, you know, I'd spent a summer in England and Scotland right after I'd graduated  in 1988 with the FFA and the Young Farmers of the United Kingdom and stayed on a couple.  Well, I stayed on 11 different farms, but a couple of them were direct marketing back  
**[0:03:31-0:03:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:03:31):**  in 88.  And I kind of thought it was crazy at the time that they were making their living selling  at farmers markets and selling to chefs and selling to other individuals.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:03:41):**  I thought, man, that looks like way too much work.  But I got to see that kind of firsthand.  And in 1998, when we got nothing for our pigs, I thought, you know, maybe we can eat out  
**[0:03:53-0:04:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:03:53):**  a living if I can make some connections with chefs in the big city and a little bit of  luck and a little bit of faith.  We sold our first pig to a restaurant in September of 1998, got more for that one pig than was  
**[0:04:07-0:04:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:04:07):**  getting for whole truck loads of them at the time.  And as luck would have it, the place that we started was Charlie Trotter in Chicago.  And you know, I just farm boy from Northeast Indiana.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:04:22):**  I didn't know who Charlie Trotter was.  I was connected to the foodie world.  But Wine Spectator magazine that same month rated him the number one restaurant in the  
**[0:04:30-0:04:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:04:30):**  world for food and wine.  So they said a little bit of luck and a little bit of faith.  We started at the top when she was selling pigs to Charlie Trotter.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:04:38):**  It's just kind of grown word of mouth from there.  Other people wanted to try it.  A couple years later, we made a really good connection with Chef Rick Bayless Fronterra  
**[0:04:48-0:04:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:04:48):**  Grill.  He's been our largest customer for about 20 years.  And up until COVID came, we were rolling along.  
**[0:04:56-0:05:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:04:56):**  I say pretty decent because the, you know, the weed actually, you know, there's a sizable  group.  But there's a sizable group of direct marketers in the country.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:05:08):**  And I think we'd finally made enough splash that we woke the big guys up.  And, you know, the I always tell people they've co-opted virtually every message from every  niche that we've produced.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:05:20):**  And without really making any meaningful changes, they've started stepping into our market.  And about 2015 on, it's kind of got a lot more difficult to be a niche producer.  But it's been an amazing journey.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:05:34):**  You know, we're still raising pastured pigs.  We got some pastured poultry on the farm, still raised some turkeys.  And we got some sheep this year.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:05:44):**  My family, my dad and grandpa sold the ewes in 1968, two years before I was born.  Me and my son brought them back this year.  So we're out here having fun, have a USDA inspected processing plan on the farm.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:05:58):**  You know, our customer bases.  Some online retailers, restaurants, some universities, some other meat shops.  Really diverse.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:06:12):**  That sounds great.  Yeah.  So, yeah, we're, you know, we're definitely unique because there's not very many of us  
**[0:06:24-0:06:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:06:24):**  little integrated operations, you know, and we jumped off the cliff in 98.  Like I said, it's been an amazing journey.  It's not been simple at all.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:06:35):**  But, you know, it's, I would do it again.  Actually, I'd love to have get to do it again, because we made some big mistakes through  the process, but we survived some.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:06:46):**  Well, you mentioned that the that the packers of the big guys were starting to invade and  cut into some of your niches.  How is that working?  
**[0:06:54-0:07:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:06:54):**  How are they doing?  You know, the we got ran out of the commodity market in 98.  And I feel like that in some days, I wake up and feel like what we did was just take  
**[0:07:08-0:07:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:07:08):**  on an awful lot more risk to have the commodity guys try to run us out of this.  And you know, you go into the conventional grocery store, and I consider Whole Foods  is conventional grocery store.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:07:21):**  So any grocery store you go into, it's just about impossible to find meat or poultry that  doesn't have what I call like to call fluffy labels on it, whether it's natural, whether  it's, you know, cage free, whether it's antibiotic free, whether it's grass fed, whether it's  
**[0:07:39-0:07:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:07:39):**  you name it, there's there's a label on virtually all local, you name it.  And there's only a handful of producers like us in the whole country.  You know, I was arguing with somebody on Twitter the other day and said it was half a dozen.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:07:57):**  And when we got all said and done, I realistically guess it's probably closer to two dozen in  the country.  So it's maybe 25 producers around the United States that are actually what the consumer  
**[0:08:09-0:08:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:08:09):**  thinks that they're getting.  Most of that, you know, every one of those things I mentioned, cage free organic, you  know, the cage free organic eggs, 10% of those come from one farm, about 100 miles north  
**[0:08:24-0:08:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:08:24):**  of us that has about a million hens, nobody that's buying cage free organic eggs thinks  they're getting hens from a farm that has a million hens.  I mean, not a single person thinks that.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:08:36):**  Organic milk, we just seen last week, the whole group out in the northeast, it's got  their pink slips, they're getting cut off from organic milk in a year from Denon from  Horizon.  
**[0:08:50-0:09:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:08:50):**  You know, we all know that that's because they've got 10 and 20,000 cow confinement  organic dairies that don't even come close to meeting the Code of Federal Regulations  in Chapter 7 for the grazing requirements.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:09:06):**  Organic cows are supposed to get 30% of their diet actually harvested from grazing.  How are they getting away with it?  You know, there's loopholes.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:09:19):**  And so that's, that's like my biggest concern with the organic labeling is it's really misled  what the intentions of the whole label were, right?  You know, the I'm not going to get too terribly political, I like to get a little political  
**[0:09:36-0:09:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:09:36):**  at times, but you can if you want.  We love doing that here.  So yeah, I always tell people the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission,  
**[0:09:47-0:10:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:09:47):**  the USDA, they've really been on vacation on all these issues since the 1970s.  And it's been both sides of the aisle.  When you get all said and done, labeling laws in this United States are go to the biggest  
**[0:10:01-0:10:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:10:01):**  bidder that, you know, we have agency capture issues in all of our federal government, and  they've largely been able to either write the labeling laws, or they've been able to  convince those guys on how they interpret the labeling laws.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:10:21):**  So you know, the some of those organic dairies considered grazing is the as far as I can  tell the, you know, they're sprouting that fodder.  They're calling that they're calling that cows grazing.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:10:35):**  Oh, and no one that buys organic milk thinks that taking small grains, adding water to  it and letting it sprout is a cow grazing.  I mean, come on, that's just absolute bullshit.  
**[0:10:47-0:11:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:10:47):**  But you know, if you have a organic standard that's owned by the USDA, and it becomes the  lowest common denominator of who will certify what, and there's some certifiers out there  that are just absolutely questionable, but it's not just organics, it's everything.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:11:04):**  The virtually no one realizes that if you go to the grocery store and buy grass fed  beef, even with a product of the USA label on it, 85% of that is foreign beef.  Yeah, because it's able to be packaged in the United States.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:11:25):**  That's what they convinced the USDA that that's the production is the packaging.  That's a bunch of bullshit too.  I mean, excuse my language.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:11:35):**  I mean, that that's not that's not what anybody thinks, you know.  So I mean, the natural that that is completely worthless on a meat and poultry label because  that, you know, you can even read from the asterisk that just means it's minimally processed.  
**[0:11:52-0:12:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:11:52):**  All meat and poultry meets the natural definition by USDA yet Consumer Reports says 34% of people  buying that think that it means that it's organic.  So I mean, it's all so I say the big the big packers have stepped into that the you live  
**[0:12:08-0:12:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:12:08):**  in Colorado, virtually all local beef comes from Aspen Ridge, which is JBS's hundred plus  thousand feedlot.  Nobody thinks JBS with 100,000 plus steers on feed is local, but that's what local is  
**[0:12:28-0:12:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:12:28):**  if you're in Colorado.  So I mean, it's it's small farmers can't compete in the retail space.  So just like us, you know, the even if you're you know, we've we've sold as much as a million  
**[0:12:41-0:12:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:12:41):**  pounds of pastured pork and poultry a year.  And you have to go around the big guys, you know, you have to sell in places that they  either can't or won't.  
**[0:12:51-0:13:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:12:51):**  And we'll never rebuild local and regional food systems until we actually have access  to the market.  So how like, okay, so those places where the big guys can't or won't sell?  
**[0:13:05-0:13:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:13:05):**  What are some of those places and and how are you getting in there?  You know, we we largely especially pre COVID we largely built our market around.  You know, I tell people we're selling the ultimate dining experience we raise a Duroc  
**[0:13:21-0:13:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:13:21):**  and a Duroc Berkshire crossbred pig, significantly higher meat quality than the conventional  pig, raised on pasture processed here on the farm, delivered fresh to a restaurant, the  big guys can't compete with that on a flavor standpoint, can't compete with that on freshness  
**[0:13:44-0:13:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:13:44):**  standpoint.  So, you know, there, there's some chefs out there that really appreciate the what we do  in that regards.  
**[0:13:52-0:14:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:13:52):**  And like I said, the big guys can't compete on that.  So you know, if we're not just competing on price, and we're instead completing on service  and quality, we have a chip selling to restaurants.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:14:08):**  You know, and we seen last week, I'm sure you guys followed Hertzog's, you know, quality  and service.  Quality and quality and service, you know, and they're an excellent example of it.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:14:24):**  We've seen it so many times over the years.  You know, our our best customers are ones where the chef is also the owner.  And so, you know, he's the one that makes the final decision.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:14:37):**  Because otherwise, you deal with something that's a big chain or a big group or whatever,  you can have the greatest relationship with the chef.  But you got to have every single person above them in their chain of command that's also  
**[0:14:50-0:15:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:14:50):**  on board with buying from you, because it only takes, it only takes one of them to kick  you out the door takes all of them for you to stay there.  The bigger that organization gets above the chef that wants the quality food, the less  
**[0:15:03-0:15:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:15:03):**  likelihood there is that they're probably going to buy it because more people, you know,  more management above that level, means they're more concerned with profit than with quality.  Right, exactly.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:15:15):**  Yeah.  And you know, the reality is, they can buy something else in the marketplace that comes  back to what we were just talking about, they can buy something else in the marketplace,  
**[0:15:24-0:15:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:15:24):**  that's got some fancy label on the package.  And they're saying, Oh, yeah, this stuff is really better.  But you know, this over here is only 25% over commodity price, because that's what most  
**[0:15:36-0:15:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:15:36):**  of the big guys get for those fancy labeled stuff is 25 to 40% over commodity for doing  basically nothing.  And we can't compete against that.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:15:46):**  So you get kicked out the door.  So it's like a big roller coaster ride.  And then that manager goes away.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:15:51):**  And you talk to the chef and you get back in the door.  Yeah, no start over.  Yeah.  
**[0:15:57-0:16:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:15:57):**  So is that like one of the biggest barriers for so I actually just looked up on Twitter.  So I did kind of an idea of what we're what you're into.  But but you had mentioned like competing for retail space.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:16:10):**  And, and I think is that one of the biggest barriers of getting retail space is talking  to the actual decision makers of the board and getting approval?  Or is it because these big commodity guys can can offer this weird scale that isn't  
**[0:16:23-0:16:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:16:23):**  necessarily the greatest quality?  Yeah, I mean, it's, it mostly comes down to price and supply.  You know, the, they they don't want to deal with a bunch of smaller producers, even though  
**[0:16:38-0:16:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:16:38):**  even though they give the impression, you know, I don't like to beat up on Whole Foods.  But, you know, most everybody understands that Whole Foods, you know, made their market  on claiming that they're buying from small family farms.  
**[0:16:52-0:17:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:16:52):**  But you know, they don't want to deal with a bunch of small family farms, they want to  deal with a couple outlets for their supply.  You know, and we can't compete on convenience, right?  
**[0:17:04-0:17:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:17:04):**  Yeah.  And, you know, it's a lot more work to have a local and regional food system.  And it's a lot more work in, you know, the that's where we found some chefs that make  
**[0:17:19-0:17:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:17:19):**  it work, and that are willing to put in the effort.  And when we started, we kind of stayed away from retail, mostly.  And you know, we we pursued a little bit of retail direct to individuals, but we couldn't  
**[0:17:35-0:17:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:17:35):**  get the volume that we needed because we made that necessary step of building a processing  plant, we needed enough volume to run through our processing plant.  And our easiest way to get some volume was to work with a handful of chefs rather than  
**[0:17:49-0:17:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:17:49):**  working with 1000s of individual customers.  Some days, I wonder whether that was the right decision or not.  But you know, it is what it is.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:17:59):**  If you had to do your meat plan again, would you or would you do it differently?  Yeah, the is the necessary evil to do what we do.  But if there was processing, and especially if we could have got processing done at someone  
**[0:18:18-0:18:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:18:18):**  that was at a slightly larger scale than us, we'd have been better off doing that.  But at the time, that probably would have been AMPAC in Chicago or something like that,  which didn't survive.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:18:33):**  So we'd have probably been in a world of hurts anyways.  And you know, realistically, to sell to restaurants, we didn't ever been able to do what we did  without us actually having the flexibility of raising or lowering the number of animals  
**[0:18:48-0:19:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:18:48):**  we processed each week, and cutting each and every one of them to a bunch of different  restaurants the way they wanted them cut and the way they wanted to package.  So yeah, we probably built the processing plant again, but it's some days, it's more  
**[0:19:01-0:19:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:19:01):**  headaches than others.  And right now with the whole labor situation, it's it's pretty rough on a little processing  plant.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:19:10):**  Can you talk a little bit more more about that?  Are you having trouble getting guys to cut and package?  Are you having inspectors?  
**[0:19:16-0:19:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:19:16):**  Um, no, we've one thing, you know, I probably bash USDA Food Safety Inspection Service probably  as much as anyone in the whole country.  And I think the Secretary Vilsack and the administrator, Mr. Kicker and all that, they  
**[0:19:32-0:19:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:19:32):**  have probably put me on that list right up there at the top.  But one thing I always say good about USDA is that I think in our 17 or 18 years here  at the farm that we've had USDA inspection, I think there's only ever been one time that  
**[0:19:47-0:20:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:19:47):**  we wanted to slaughter that we didn't have an inspector.  And that was one that literally walked off our line when his 12 hours was up and didn't  even tell us that, you know, because we would have probably just stopped so that he absolutely  
**[0:20:01-0:20:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:20:01):**  had to go home.  But other than that, we've always got an inspector.  So we've been fortunate in that regard.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:20:07):**  Now, sometimes we get some crazy ones, I always like to talk about that there's two groups.  So well, there's actually three groups, there's the same and reasonable group, which I think  makes up about 80% of USDA.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:20:19):**  And then you got the ones on the one end, I like to call them the lazies.  And you got the ones on the other end that are the crazies.  And you know, they they can definitely make your life really interesting.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:20:29):**  And you know, the unintended consequence of regulations and food safety standards is that  it costs substantially more for a little operation to deal with them than it does a big operation.  But you know, we do.  
**[0:20:45-0:21:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:20:45):**  When you get all said and done, I don't know that I can really argue about or say that  there was any one specific food safety regulation that I would want gone.  I think that there's been some times that we definitely have a different interpretation  
**[0:21:00-0:21:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:21:00):**  and some USDA but I think we'd be largely operating the in the same manner.  Whether we had USDA now, employee wise, I don't think most people realize that even  when labor is not tight.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:21:18):**  It's really, really difficult to staff a slaughter plant, there's a large percentage of our population  that is not going to work in a slaughter plant, no matter what.  And you know, I think part of that is that we're just so far removed and so far disconnected  
**[0:21:36-0:21:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:21:36):**  from our food supply.  I think part of that is a misconception of what people think happens in very small slaughter  plants, because you know, we get our chefs and customers come out all the time.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:21:49):**  And a lot of them say, man, I was expecting it to be a lot more gross than that I was  expecting it to be more violent.  I was expecting you know, they they list off bunches of things.  
**[0:21:58-0:22:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:21:58):**  And, you know, it's not that I mean, don't get me wrong.  There's parts of a slaughter plant and a processing plant that's too cold, too hot, too wet, too  dry.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:22:09):**  I mean, you're dealing with live animals, it's dirty.  It's, I mean, it's difficult work, everything that we do on the farm and everything we do  on the processing plant is hard work.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:22:19):**  And you know, there's large portions of our society that is not hard work anymore.  So yeah, and I think farms and processing plants, but I think slaughter plants in general,  have a more difficult time on staffing and when you know, there just aren't enough people  
**[0:22:35-0:22:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:22:35):**  to go around.  It gets really, really scary to the slaughter plant when you know, they can go make as much  money flipping burgers that you can afford to pay.  
**[0:22:46-0:22:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:22:46):**  You know, it's it's definitely an uncertain time.  And then you know, you have a pipeline of animals coming in because you're scheduled,  you know, you're scheduled so far out.  
**[0:22:57-0:23:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:22:57):**  Do you just do your own stuff?  Or do you do stuff for other folks?  Nope, we, um, one of our flexes after COVID was that we've started to process pigs for  
**[0:23:06-0:23:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:23:06):**  other people.  We always chose in the past not to do it mainly over biosecurity issues, but we put some changes  in place and, you know, and especially since the shortages was so bad everywhere.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:23:23):**  We slaughter and process some pigs for some other people now and that actually works out  quite well.  We used to try to slaughter some chickens for other people.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:23:32):**  And the labor requirements on poultry is so much higher per pound and pigs and that never  really worked.  Oh, really?  
**[0:23:40-0:23:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:23:40):**  We had we we quit doing chickens this year.  We did pasture chickens about 120,000 of them a year until this year.  And what's the main thing?  
**[0:23:51-0:24:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:23:51):**  Is it the feathers or no?  No, I mean, we're actually really, really good at scalding and plucking them.  But, yeah, so the feathers wasn't a was never really a huge issue.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:24:03):**  The big problem is the you know, the bird weighs, it's just the physics of it.  The bird weighs, you know, four and a half pounds, and there's still tasks that you have  to do on that.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:24:13):**  And our scale, we couldn't justify the millions of dollars worth of equipment to do that with  machines.  So our chicken line would take 20 to 22 people on the line to do about the exact same number  
**[0:24:26-0:24:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:24:26):**  of pounds of chickens in a morning that we can do with seven or eight people on our pig  line.  So, you know, we have just way, way more dollars in processing and chicken.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:24:39):**  And when you get all said and done, you have chicken.  And the this whole industrialization of our food supply goes down a path.  And I don't think most of us ever, you know, we talk about it, but I don't think we really  
**[0:24:52-0:24:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:24:52):**  stop and think about it.  The chicken industry has done one thing really, really well.  And I actually hate him for it.  
**[0:24:58-0:25:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:24:58):**  But they've made chicken really, really cheap.  And when you make chicken really, really cheap, there's absolutely no way for a small operation  that wants to do something by hand, raise them where the chicken actually ought to be  
**[0:25:12-0:25:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:25:12):**  where it gets to scratch on the ground, gets chase a few bugs, gets to actually see the  sun.  You can't afford to do that because when you get all said and done, the American people  
**[0:25:23-0:25:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:25:23):**  still think that chicken should be cheap.  Pastured chicken should cost as much as beef or pork because it costs as much to produce.  But people are like, no matter where we sold it, it still had to be the cheapest item on  
**[0:25:38-0:25:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:25:38):**  the menu.  Well, before John Tyson figured it out, chicken was one of the most expensive meats.  Yep.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:25:47):**  Really?  Yeah.  In the 20s and 30s, Depression era, nobody ate chicken.  
**[0:25:52-0:26:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:25:52):**  The farmers ate chicken because that's, you know, they always had chickens, but nobody  in the cities was eating chicken.  You know, you guys know Will Harris, White Oaks pastor?  
**[0:26:02-0:26:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:26:02):**  Yeah.  He sends me a screenshot from history.  I think the one is from like 1916, a menu and the chicken was more expensive than the  
**[0:26:13-0:26:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:26:13):**  beef on the menu in 1916.  And yeah.  Will Harris, hopefully another future guest on the Ranching Reboot podcast.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:26:23):**  Will and his southern drawl, I think that you could listen to him for an hour, read  the phone book.  When I met Will, it was out of the Regenerate Conference in 2019.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:26:34):**  I don't know if I've told this story on air before or not, but it was, we're just come  out of a big session and I saw Will Harris and went up and I introduced myself and I  started talking to him and then up walks Mike Calacrate.  
**[0:26:50-0:27:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:26:50):**  And if you could imagine Will and Mike Calacrate for an hour and a half, I just stood there  just soaking it all in.  Those two guys are legends.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:27:01):**  I think that if I'm not mistaken, I think I spoke at that conference and I think I had  lunch with Mike right before I went up and spoke.  I should send you the link to that sometime because I kind of told some interesting stories  
**[0:27:17-0:27:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:27:17):**  about Mr. Almanza and JBS and him going to take that job and everything.  It was a pretty interesting talk.  Mike got me kind of wound up before I went up on stage.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:27:29):**  I was going to say, did he get you fired up before you had to get up and talk?  Because I could totally see that.  Mike is really, really good about that.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:27:36):**  Oh yeah.  I was like, he was our fourth episode when we started the podcast and I just like thought  about it for weeks.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:27:45):**  I was like, Brian, I can't stop thinking about everything you said.  Mike and Will are both really, really good friends.  I've known both of them for a long time, been out to both of their places.  
**[0:27:56-0:28:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:27:56):**  Mike's been here to the farm several times.  And you guys definitely see eye to eye about meat packer concentration and the lack of  market transparency and why that that's such a bad thing.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:28:12):**  Yeah.  I see just about completely eye to eye with Mike, Will's got a scaled enough operation  that I think he's virtually gave up on the fact that there'll ever be a competitive commodity  
**[0:28:29-0:28:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:28:29):**  market again.  But I see the same as Mike because I still, I don't know that we'd ever go back to the  commodity market because we chose a different route.

Cause it comes back to that same thing, the problem we had with the chickens.  
**[0:28:57-0:29:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:28:57):**  If the other product is so dirt cheap and has no value to any consumer anywhere, it's  really, really difficult to sell something that does have some value.  That has some real true actual costs in it.  
**[0:29:14-0:29:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:29:14):**  Instead of trying to externalize the cost or exploit cheap labor, cheap grain somewhere  else.  Right.  
**[0:29:22-0:29:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:29:22):**  So let's talk about supply chains.  Are you experiencing a lot of supply chain disruptions?  Are you seeing a lot of that, any of that stuff on your radar?  
**[0:29:34-0:29:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:29:34):**  You see it everywhere, but we're kind of fortunate in that I think we don't have serious problems  in it.  Like the materials for the plant, we buy our packaging materials several months at a time.  
**[0:29:53-0:30:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:29:53):**  So I don't think we're having problems there.  We have a really antiquated and probably too many tractors on the farm.  So we don't have parts and issues like that.  
**[0:30:06-0:30:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:30:06):**  We don't really have a lot of specialty equipment per se, don't raise much crops.  So we're not really seeing much supply chain issues.  Now everything's going through the roof on costs of everything that we use.  
**[0:30:25-0:30:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:30:25):**  But now I think that the...  Like fertilizer and, fertilizer I saw the other day where China was said, they're not  going to export any phosphate in 2022, which that's 40% of our phosphate supply for fertilizer.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:30:45):**  The one that scares me a little bit, we still feed a fair amount of corn because our eggs  and our poultry aren't ruminant.  So we have to feed some corn.  
**[0:30:57-0:31:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:30:57):**  And I'm starting to hear an awful lot of farmers talk about their anhydrous and their nitrogen  costs.  And I haven't really tracked it completely, but they're talking about double and triple  
**[0:31:09-0:31:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:31:09):**  the cost.  I got a good enough understanding of crop production.  I know that they can probably skimp for a while on their phosphorus and their potassium  
**[0:31:20-0:31:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:31:20):**  and still come up with these trend line yields.  Our US corn supply without nitrogen, those boys don't know how to raise corn without  nitrogen.  
**[0:31:31-0:31:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:31:31):**  We don't have corn crop if we don't have anhydrous and nitrogen in the United States.  Because we want to talk about resiliency.  We don't have any resiliency in the meat and poultry industry because we slaughter almost  
**[0:31:44-0:32:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:31:44):**  all the cattle and 27 plants in 13 States, 85 or 86%.  We slaughter 90 some percent of the pigs in about 40 plants in this country.  But we raise all of this corn to feed the non-ruminate animals and it's hand to mouth  
**[0:32:04-0:32:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:32:04):**  on nitrogen needs.  And it's all propped up by huge amounts of inputs.  And they just plain won't do it without nitrogen.  
**[0:32:16-0:32:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:32:16):**  And at some point, and I guess in the grain farmers defense, they've been really good  for decades about continuing to produce corn and soybeans, whether they make any money  or not.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:32:30):**  So I guess maybe they'll continue to go on because that's just the history of crop farming  in the United States.  So like corn farming, I think the number is 96, 97% of the acres planted to corn is not  
**[0:32:46-0:32:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:32:46):**  for human consumption.  And then you can further break that down and say, well, there's a lot that go to biofuels  and there's some that go to corn oil.  
**[0:32:55-0:33:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:32:55):**  But yeah, a lot of it does go to livestock feed.  And is it an efficient use of land?  Maybe.  
**[0:33:02-0:33:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:33:02):**  Does it grow a lot per acre?  Yeah.  But what's the cost?  
**[0:33:06-0:33:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:33:06):**  What's the input cost?  What do we need to haul?  And how much fossil fuel does it take?  
**[0:33:13-0:33:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:33:13):**  Because a lot of those fertilizers come from natural gas as a raw feedstock.  And how much of those fertilizers does it take?  And how much energy is it taking to actually grow this crop?  
**[0:33:25-0:33:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:33:25):**  And are we getting ahead by using it as biofuel at all?  Those are some of the real questions I have.  Well, I mean, I'm kind of, I guess, as most people probably figured out, I'm probably  
**[0:33:38-0:33:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:33:38):**  a little radical and probably don't normally always fit in in rural America too well.  But you know, the rough numbers and you want to really fire up corn and soybean farmers,  the rough numbers with my calculations is somewhere around 10,000 miles per acre, planting  
**[0:33:58-0:34:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:33:58):**  corn, turning it into ethanol, putting it into a gas car.  That same acre of land is about 750,000 miles with solar panels as a solar farm, running  through an electric car.  
**[0:34:16-0:34:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:34:16):**  So I mean, it's, you know, what, 7500 times more efficient to take those same land, you  know, but farmers are like, Oh, man, we can't take any of this land away because we need  to continue to raise corn.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:34:32):**  We take 40 some percent of the corn, turn it into ethanol.  And the best study you can find is about 1.35 units of energy produced for every unit of  energy that went into producing the corn.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:34:44):**  I think that's a bullshit number.  I think it's an idiot.  You think it's I mean, I really I wouldn't, it wouldn't surprise me.  
**[0:34:51-0:35:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:34:51):**  But you know, in lots of ways, isn't our the CAFO industry, the confinement livestock industry  isn't the feedlots, isn't the ethanol industry, really just to deal with the fact that we've  had massive overproduction in agriculture for decades.  
**[0:35:11-0:35:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:35:11):**  And we've we've topped it up because we had to they had to do something with this corn  instead of just piling it up everywhere and letting it rot.  So they turned it into ethanol.  
**[0:35:20-0:35:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:35:20):**  They raise bar pigs that the Chinese and the Brazilians own to export to somewhere that  is just a really, really fragile system that has just economically gutted rural America.  The economic metrics of rural America look worse than the inner cities.  
**[0:35:41-0:35:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:35:41):**  And yet they're just saying, Oh, this is all grand and we're feeding the world.  We're feeding the world, but we're not even feeding the farmers in rural America.  Yeah, you know, you touched on something about that we're taking these pigs that are owned  
**[0:35:58-0:36:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:35:58):**  by foreign interests, we're going to run them through a slaughterhouse that's owned by foreign  interests.  And we're feeding them corn and soybeans that's heavily subsidized by the American taxpayer,  
**[0:36:10-0:36:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:36:10):**  just so meat can be cheap.  But what like, what's just right under the surface is that all these meat packers, and  I'll call them out Smithfield, JBS, Longford, they're all owned by by either Brazil or China.  
**[0:36:27-0:36:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:36:27):**  And that's where all our subsidies are going.  That's where the that's where the crop subsidies that the government pays farmers, they end  up in the bank accounts of the big packers.  
**[0:36:34-0:36:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:36:34):**  Right?  I mean, it's real easy to connect the dots.  But you know, enough people's pockets are getting line that we as a society choose not  
**[0:36:44-0:36:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:36:44):**  to connect the dots.  And it's, it's weird.  It's like we almost have blinders on and you got to wonder why, why aren't people talking  
**[0:36:56-0:37:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:36:56):**  about these things?  You know, why is this all been buried?  Why Why isn't this on front page news?  
**[0:37:04-0:37:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:37:04):**  Meat packers make billions to overseas investors while American ranchers starve?  Yeah, I mean, that's a really, really good question.  Because, you know, some of us talk about it, but it doesn't feel like the, you know, and  
**[0:37:19-0:37:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:37:19):**  I don't feel like that when we talk to consumers or taxpayers or the average American, you  know, everybody, except for a handful of farmers that think they're going to be the last one  standing.  
**[0:37:31-0:37:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:37:31):**  And I agree with what we say, but man, it's really hard to get enough momentum to actually  get states in Washington, DC to really do something different about it.  And I think a lot of it comes back to that whole that I mentioned before agency capture,  
**[0:37:48-0:38:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:37:48):**  you know, the these corporations have some really powerful people in some really high  places.  And our government on virtually every decision, makes choices that are contrary to the interest  
**[0:38:03-0:38:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:38:03):**  of independent family farms, and they've done it for decades, and they just continue to  do it.  Well, we, I think we've done a great job of kind of laying out the problem.  
**[0:38:14-0:38:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:38:14):**  So how do we fix it?  Um, you know, I tell people, I think we got to do four things.  I think the we have to start with subsidy reform.  
**[0:38:24-0:38:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:38:24):**  We have to quit encouraging through subsidies, the industrialization of agriculture, and  the you know, the proliferation of money going towards just a handful of people, the subsidies  need to be about real food, rather than just corn and soybeans, if there's going to be  
**[0:38:50-0:39:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:38:50):**  subsidies.  So we need subsidy reform, we need labeling reform, people need to be able to go into  the marketplace, and they need to be able to trust what is on that package, you know,  
**[0:39:03-0:39:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:39:03):**  rattled off a whole bunch of them.  But you know, whether it's natural, whether it's organic grass fed, gestation, crate free,  you name it, cage free people, if they're going to spend a premium for it, and this  
**[0:39:20-0:39:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:39:20):**  is in the interest of both niche and commodity producers, that those are actually transparent  and meaningful, because they harm both the niche and the commodity producers because  they clearly take away part of our demand.  
**[0:39:35-0:39:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:39:35):**  But they're also harming the commodity producers, because it's just another step in this progression,  where they take commodity products, the packer and the retailer get a premium for it, the  commodity producer gets zero premium for that.  
**[0:39:50-0:40:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:39:50):**  We need antitrust enforcement.  We need the Federal Trade Commission, Department of Justice, the Packer and Stockyards Administration,  they actually have to do their job.  
**[0:40:02-0:40:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:40:02):**  There's glaring examples, you know, the sheep slaughter plant out in Colorado last year,  JBS, the largest importer of lamb into the United States, buys up a sheep slaughter plant  with the sole intention of shuttering it for sheep slaughter.  
**[0:40:26-0:40:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:40:26):**  It had the capacity to slaughter about 20% of the lambs in the western United States,  no longer a lamb slaughter plant.  JBS didn't buy that for financial interest to own that plant.  
**[0:40:41-0:41:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:40:41):**  They bought that in their financial interest to get rid of competition.  We have laws on the books, Clayton Act, Sherman Act, Packer and Stockyards Act, that make  it clear that we actually need competitive markets in this country, and that we're not  
**[0:41:00-0:41:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:41:00):**  supposed to allow individual corporations to get big enough to make decisions that could  impact the market.  Every single one of those four corporations that you mentioned before are big enough that  
**[0:41:13-0:41:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:41:13):**  their individual decisions impact the marketplace.  We have packing plants that are big enough that whether there's a fire, whether there's  Russian hackers, whether there's COVID issues, one plant has an impact on the marketplace.  
**[0:41:30-0:41:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:41:30):**  We're a smart enough and an affluent enough society that we should not have allowed that  to happen, and we're an affluent and smart enough society that we should go in a separate  direction.  
**[0:41:40-0:41:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:41:40):**  Food security is national security, and we have to enforce antitrust laws.  They're on the books.  It's time that the Federal Trade Commission, Department of Justice, and the USDA goes back  
**[0:41:52-0:42:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:41:52):**  to work.  And then the final thing is that we need some inspection reform.  Small plants, very small plants especially, if they're going to get a chance to operate  
**[0:42:10-0:42:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:42:10):**  and function, they have to have reasonable inspection, and there has to be some safeguards  in place for when they get both of them, for the consumer and the plant standpoint, those  crazies and those lazies that I like to talk about in inspection.  
**[0:42:30-0:42:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:42:30):**  USDA Food Safety Inspection Service is expending a huge amount of resources for modernization  of poultry and pork, and they're working on beef, and they're doing that to cut their  labor force, but the biggest reason that they're doing that is that they're doing that because  
**[0:42:49-0:43:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:42:49):**  this new inspection system makes it so the lines more consistently run at full and even  faster line speeds.  They won't tell anybody that, but that's the realistic reason.  
**[0:43:02-0:43:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:43:02):**  They have staffing issues, so they eliminate part of the staffing issues by making the  plant do part of the inspection, and if they don't have as many employees show up, under  the old inspection systems like poultry, for example, every inspector didn't show up.  
**[0:43:18-0:43:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:43:18):**  The plant had to run 35 birds less per minute.  Under the new inspection system, the plant's the one that has to do that inspection.  They have an inspector at the end of the line.  
**[0:43:27-0:43:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:43:27):**  They can be 50% short staffed, and the plant's still running at full speed.  Before if they'd have been 50% short staffed, the plant would have run at 50%.  So the new inspection systems are really about making sure that the new plants can run at  
**[0:43:42-0:43:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:43:42):**  full speed.  They're putting in virtually no effort to make it so that we have more resilient, robust,  and appropriate...  
**[0:43:51-0:44:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:43:51):**  Oops, sorry, my phone called... they're putting in no effort at all to make it so that we  have resilient, robust, and appropriate inspection systems for little plants.  Their answer always for why there isn't little plants is that these people just need more  
**[0:44:13-0:44:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:44:13):**  resources.  We actually have the resources available now.  There's groups like the Niche Meet Processors Assistance Network, lots of the extension  
**[0:44:21-0:44:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:44:21):**  services.  The available resources for little plants are much greater now.  Talk about my plant, for example, compared to the modern inspection plant.  
**[0:44:33-0:44:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:44:33):**  We get three USDA inspectors a day.  One full time, one that's at our farm eight hours a day.  The veterinarian that's on a patrol, he normally shows up for a couple hours a day, and then

So we get a patrol inspector for a couple hours there.  One of the modern park inspection plants, 35 miles up the road, that does 8,000 to 11,000  
**[0:44:58-0:45:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:44:58):**  pigs a day, they get four inspectors.  We get three.  You're serious.  
**[0:45:02-0:45:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:45:02):**  No, I'm serious.  I'm serious.  That's why the rules favor the big guys.  
**[0:45:07-0:45:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:45:07):**  Well, there's a certain amount, no matter how small you get, there's still a certain  amount of inspection that is required.  My argument would be that USDA has completely dragged its feet over this cooperative state  
**[0:45:24-0:45:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:45:24):**  inspection system.  That was initially in the 2002 Farm Bill.  USDA finally promulgated regulations so that there could be a cooperative state inspection  
**[0:45:36-0:45:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:45:36):**  plant, and that's where a state inspected plant can use a federal legend and can sell  across state lines.  They finally did that in 2014.  
**[0:45:44-0:45:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:45:44):**  They were told to do it in 2002 Farm Bill.  They got around to it in 2014.  On the modern inspection stuff, they were told not to do it, and they had five plants  
**[0:45:57-0:46:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:45:57):**  that they were allowed to do for a pilot project.  They added the plant down the road here as number six when they were told by Congress  not to add anymore.  
**[0:46:07-0:46:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:46:07):**  So their attitude is that let's go out of our way to make it easier for, and I wouldn't  necessarily say easier, they want to go out of their way to make it so that the big guys,  cost of production is lower, and they're more consistently able to run.  
**[0:46:22-0:46:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:46:22):**  I think they go out of their way on the opposite end to make it so that the little guys, cost  of production is higher, and we're not consistent.  And I think that they need to level that playing field as much as they need to worry about  
**[0:46:35-0:46:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:46:35):**  the leveling the food safety playing field.  You know, you're right.  I can't disagree, but I can also see that this is a case where they've kind of done  
**[0:46:46-0:46:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:46:46):**  the minimum necessary to keep food flowing.  Because like you said, food security is national security.  The only thing scarier to the government than a Bible thump and Republican that has a gun  
**[0:46:58-0:47:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:46:58):**  is one that's hungry.  I mean, you take away people's food for just a couple of days, and they're going to get  upset real fast.  
**[0:47:07-0:47:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:47:07):**  So like food riots is the one thing the government wants to avoid at all costs.  That means we've got to keep the meat supply flowing.  Right, but at some point, and you know, before COVID, I was probably one of those tinfoil  
**[0:47:23-0:47:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:47:23):**  cat paranoid conspiracy theory people when I was talking to people saying, you know,  the big cities really only have three days, 72 hours worth of food supply.  And if this food supply doesn't keep cranking, you literally could run out of food in the  
**[0:47:40-0:47:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:47:40):**  grocery store.  You know, before 2020, people looked at you and said, you're nuts.  Now they're like, Hmm, what was this Greg saying over here?  
**[0:47:49-0:48:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:47:49):**  Because you know that that's a reality.  And you know, where do I go to learn how to plant a garden?  Right, right up up to a certain point, this whole idea of industrialization specialization,  
**[0:48:01-0:48:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:48:01):**  you know, it's extremely efficient and productive when it's all working.  But up to a certain point, they they I believe that they finally somewhat realize that you  can go too far pushing that whole cheap food and scale biggest fragile point, it becomes  
**[0:48:18-0:48:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:48:18):**  fragile, and then it's no longer long term.  It's not cheap, efficient, secure food.  And we've got to that point as a country to to where food when it's working, is really,  
**[0:48:34-0:48:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:48:34):**  really cheap, really, really efficient.  And now we can argue all day and I'd be on the side arguing that that has huge amount  of hidden costs.  
**[0:48:44-0:48:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:48:44):**  Not good for the animal, not good for the average American, good for rural America,  all of that stuff.  But that argument never really got very far with people.  
**[0:48:53-0:49:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:48:53):**  But nowadays, most people realize when you started talking about it, we should not have  let foreign entities own and control our food supply.  We should not have allowed it to become so consolidated, so industrialized, to the point  
**[0:49:10-0:49:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:49:10):**  that it's no longer secure.  And people realize it's no longer secure.  You know what?  
**[0:49:18-0:49:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:49:18):**  It was about a month ago, there was a couple cases of BSE in Brazil, barely heard a peep  about it in our news, but China overnight shut down beef imports from Brazil.  They had a case, I think, two weeks ago.  
**[0:49:33-0:49:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:49:33):**  I think that was in Britain.  Do you remember C.K.?  Yes, it was in England.  
**[0:49:37-0:49:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:49:37):**  It was in Britain.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[0:49:40-0:49:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:49:40):**  Barely heard a blip about it on the news.  You know, seven years ago, the cow that killed Christmas, you know, that didn't even get  into food supply, that tanked our cattle market, you know, like, is there any consistency?  
**[0:49:53-0:50:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:49:53):**  Is there anything that you can point to that says, no, the cattle market's not fraudulent  or it's actually working like it should?  Or is it just a totally, totally fraudulent system?  
**[0:50:04-0:50:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:50:04):**  Oh, it's a fraudulent system.  The largest processor of beef in the United States is a criminal organization.  You know, I tell people all the time, we have laws in this country.  
**[0:50:21-0:50:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:50:21):**  And in fact, I'll share with you on Twitter afterwards, I got a letter back from the USDA  Food Safety Inspection Service because I've been hounding them for years.  The Meat and Poultry Act does not allow convicted felons to be in the meat business in the United  
**[0:50:41-0:50:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:50:41):**  States.  They actually enforce it on small and very small plants.  The Batista brothers have never been convicted in the US court.  
**[0:50:54-0:51:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:50:54):**  You sound just like Mr. Kicker.  You sound just like the undersecretaries every time I told them that.  Up until October of 2020, they've been convicted then.  
**[0:51:07-0:51:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:51:07):**  They finally had got convicted over that rotten beef and the fraud and the bribery in a US  court and they also got convicted over price fixing in a US court.  So I immediately sent off a letter to the USDA Food Safety Inspection Service administrator  
**[0:51:29-0:51:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:51:29):**  because they told me, I bet you they told me 20 times, Greg, yes, but our laws do not  cover felonies in foreign countries.  Well, then they had felonies in the United States.  
**[0:51:42-0:51:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:51:42):**  I got this long letter back.  They're supposedly investigating it, but I don't know.  I think it's difficult to point to there not being fraudulent activities that go on in  
**[0:51:58-0:52:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:51:58):**  the meat industry because there are.  The largest processor of beef in the United States has a track record around the globe  of convicted felonies.  
**[0:52:11-0:52:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:52:11):**  We have laws.  We're not supposed to have that.  And fines and bribery charges.  
**[0:52:17-0:52:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:52:17):**  We just choose not to enforce it.  I do think one thing that the other point I like to make about what's going on in the  beef industry now is the and I'm sure you guys have all heard it before.  
**[0:52:30-0:52:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:52:30):**  You know, when I told people that we ought to have more packing plants, we ought to actually  have more farmers in the United States.  We ought to have a larger percentage of our production coming from niche producers direct  
**[0:52:42-0:52:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:52:42):**  to consumers.  The answer always from the Farm Bureau types and the industrial food types was that the  American consumer cannot afford that, that we need cheap food.  
**[0:52:53-0:53:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:52:53):**  Well, that's a that's not accurate because look at the spread right now between live  beef and what the Packers are getting for them.  It's seven hundred to a thousand dollars been running.  
**[0:53:07-0:53:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:53:07):**  It ran.  It's ran a little bit higher net national beef last quarter.  And it's seven hundred bucks per steer that they slaughtered small processing plants don't  
**[0:53:19-0:53:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:53:19):**  charge seven hundred dollars for processing.  So somebody is lying when they say that the American consumer can't afford the processing  cost of very small processing in the U.S.  
**[0:53:31-0:53:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:53:31):**  The American consumers paying it to the big packer and the big retailer right now.  They can afford it.  They're paying the bill.  
**[0:53:39-0:53:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:53:39):**  Yeah, and I think Mike, Mike Calacrate even has data that shows that like his small plants  are twice as efficient at breaking down meat per man as the big guys are.  Right.  
**[0:53:51-0:54:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:53:51):**  You know, so it's not necessarily a matter of efficiency.  It's just, you know, scale and minimizing that governmental that that regulatory compliance  cost.  
**[0:54:03-0:54:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:54:03):**  And you know, to some degree, I guess if you're the Batista brothers, it's just another bribe  away.  Right.  
**[0:54:10-0:54:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:54:10):**  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[0:54:13-0:54:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:54:13):**  I mean, they I'm sure you you know the story, but, you know, they bribed somewhere between  fifteen hundred and twenty one hundred politicians and inspectors in Brazil.  And we were the only developed country in the world that did not immediately cut off  
**[0:54:32-0:54:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:54:32):**  imports from Brazil when that bribery scandal broke.  And I shit you not.  Three days after the person that made the decision in the United States to not cut them  
**[0:54:43-0:55:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:54:43):**  off, Al Almanza, the administrator for USDA Food Safety Inspection Service, three days  after he retired, he took a five million dollar signing bonus to go work for JBS's Global  Quality Assurance vice president.  
**[0:55:00-0:55:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:55:00):**  We have laws in this country for that to two year, four year and lifetime ethics rules  on whether you can take those kind of jobs.  That's nowhere close to a conflict of interest.  
**[0:55:14-0:55:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:55:14):**  We as a country didn't cut them off till Sonny Perdue was confirmed.  Sonny Perdue cut them off.  And why does that why does everybody not just up in arms over that?  
**[0:55:26-0:55:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:55:26):**  That is that is not just a conflict of interest.  That's criminal.  I'm sure that if I run into Al Almanza somewhere, he's not going to like me because I tell everybody  
**[0:55:38-0:55:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:55:38):**  he ought to be sitting in jail with the Batista brothers.  So what would happen?  What would happen if the DOJ did crack down on him tomorrow and put the Batista brothers  
**[0:55:51-0:55:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:55:51):**  in jail?  Do you think that would like it?  Is there regulatory is there regulatory relief?  
**[0:55:59-0:56:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:55:59):**  Like is there really anything that will help to meet markets and dissolve these things?  Do you have any hope that the government will actually use the weapons in their toolbox  to force Packers and Stockyard Act and antitrust rules?  
**[0:56:14-0:56:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:56:14):**  You know, I, I have a little bit of hope.  You know, we put a as a country we put a person in as the Federal Trade Commissioner chairman  that thinks she's going to do a wonderful job.  
**[0:56:27-0:56:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:56:27):**  We got a few people, Rohit has is really strong on these issues.  Both the president and the secretary have really, really strong concentration advisors  in Tim Wu and Andy Green.  
**[0:56:46-0:57:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:56:46):**  You know, but we still got an awful lot up there that don't take these issues very serious.  And I don't think we've got a Supreme Court.  And I, I could be wrong, but I've never had any dealings with anyone at DOJ that really  
**[0:57:08-0:57:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:57:08):**  likes to get serious about these issues.  But, you know, I think we already have one of the highest percentages of incarcerated  populations in the world.  
**[0:57:20-0:57:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:57:20):**  We probably ought to add some money in the budget for more prisons, if we're going to  really go after the criminals in the meat business, because it's a lot of them.  Or let some of them.  
**[0:57:32-0:57:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:57:32):**  What do you think it is?  Is it is it just like, because it's food, it's not that big of a crime?  Like they're not weighing this as a really a huge injustice where they're waiting, you  
**[0:57:46-0:57:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:57:46):**  know, drugs and stuff like that.  Like I'm just confused where the disconnect is.  I really think it comes back to that whole feed the world cheap food policy.  
**[0:57:58-0:58:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:57:58):**  And I really think that they believe this is a necessary evil in order to feed society  and keep the masses calm on that, you know, if JBS is going to send a little bit of rotten  beef to the United States, which was 11% rejected at the border and normal percentage is half  
**[0:58:19-0:58:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:58:19):**  a percent for paperwork.  11% real food safety issues.  Ah, you know, that kind of stuff just happens every once in a while.  
**[0:58:27-0:58:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:58:27):**  American people are-  What would happen to you if 11% of pork that went out of your door was shut?  You'd get shut down.  
**[0:58:34-0:58:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:58:34):**  Yeah, we'd get shut down.  And you know, that's one of the big differences.  And that that'd be one of the arguments for a more sane and reasonable inspection system  
**[0:58:44-0:58:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:58:44):**  on little processors is that there's actually accountability when you know your end customers.  I couldn't send a rotten product out.  I would have no customer base.

**[0:59:05-0:59:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:59:05):**  We'll never do that again.  Really any accountability in that?  I mean, there really isn't any accountability in our system.  
**[0:59:14-0:59:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:59:14):**  So, how do you feel about traceability?  You know, my take on it from us personally, I think the traceability for what we do is  absolutely essential.  
**[0:59:30-0:59:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:59:30):**  I think that a lot of these things that they're trying to push on to farmers and ranchers  comes right back to that greenwashing, those labeling issues, the traceability, the roundtable  for sustainable beef.  
**[0:59:47-0:59:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:59:47):**  They're just trying to pass costs off on to farmers and ranchers without paying them any  kind of premium.  And I think that's wrong.  
**[0:59:59-1:00:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=0:59:59):**  And I think that if we actually had a truly competitive market, farmers would get choices  of who they would get to sell to.  You know, in the hog industry, you can't sell pigs, commodity pigs without your port quality  
**[1:00:14-1:00:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:00:14):**  assurance level three certification.  If there was more choices in packers, there would probably be packers that would pay a  little bit less and say, hey, we don't care if you have that because we have a customer  
**[1:00:27-1:00:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:00:27):**  base that doesn't need it.  But all of them get together and say, hey, you got to have that.  None of them pay anything for it.  
**[1:00:34-1:00:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:00:34):**  It's just a necessary required evil, the traceability.  And then the hypocrisy of the industry, you know, like they talk about what their traceability  costs.  
**[1:00:46-1:01:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:00:46):**  But at the same time, you know, Proposition 12 is a good example.  They're all up in arms over the given gestating sows, 24 square feet instead of 14 square  feet.  
**[1:01:00-1:01:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:01:00):**  All of them are just way too few a square feet for a sow because neither one of them  the sow doesn't get to express its natural instincts.  But regardless, the industry always tells you and you've seen it everywhere that, oh,  
**[1:01:16-1:01:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:01:16):**  we know exactly where all this meat comes from.  We can trace it all back.  And we got 100% traceability when they tell you that, hey, you've got to segregate this  
**[1:01:26-1:01:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:01:26):**  port to go to California versus not.  They're like, oh, that's going to add too much cost to us.  You just got done telling us that you knew where every single bit of it was and you could  
**[1:01:38-1:01:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:01:38):**  track it all through the plant.  Now you're saying it's going to cost too much to track it all through the plant.  Which story is correct here?  
**[1:01:44-1:02:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:01:44):**  Because if it's going to cost you a lot more, you're not doing it now.  I keep saying shake the hand that feeds you and it's an accountability thing.  I'm not going to sell you rotten meat.  
**[1:02:03-1:02:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:02:03):**  You're not going to sell me rotten meat.  We're not going to grow old and try to sell rotten vegetables.  That's not what people do.  
**[1:02:12-1:02:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:02:12):**  That's not what a person does to another person.  Maybe a corporation might do that because some underling is just like, I don't care.  It's not my deal.  
**[1:02:19-1:02:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:02:19):**  We'll go ahead and ship that anyway.  And there's no accountability.  And the bigger a corporation or organization gets, the less clear that chain of accountability  
**[1:02:30-1:02:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:02:30):**  is.  So we're talking about cheap food.  Let's talk about why that's such a bad thing and how fragile is our food supply really?  
**[1:02:46-1:03:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:02:46):**  Yeah, I mean, the whole concept of cheap food, you know, food should be available to people,  but I don't, this whole idea that it should be cheap was really not a wise plan.  You know, like I said before, it's just gutted rural America economically.  
**[1:03:14-1:03:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:03:14):**  You know, I was raised as a pig farmer, so I like to talk about pigs more so than cattle.  But when I was my son's age, there was 600,000 hog farmers in the United States.  And I've got a degree in economics from Purdue University.  
**[1:03:31-1:03:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:03:31):**  Don't claim to be an economist, but I do have a degree in economics.  And you know, there's some terms that I think that we should all get familiar with.  And one of them is the velocity of money.  
**[1:03:43-1:03:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:03:43):**  And there's been several studies and, you know, I think we forget most of them now,  but it was way more common that they were printed and shared a lot when the hog industry  was actually consolidated.  
**[1:03:58-1:04:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:03:58):**  But the studies show that because of velocity of money, those family hog farms, those funds  that came in for those pigs, those would circulate in that economy up to seven times.  You know, it went to Main Street, it went to the local hardware, it went to the feed  
**[1:04:17-1:04:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:04:17):**  mill, it went to farmers down the road that was growing the corn for the feed mill.  You know, it went to you name it.  We actually had main streets and we actually had rural communities when we had family farms.  
**[1:04:31-1:04:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:04:31):**  Now that money just is gone because Smithfield, the largest owner of pigs in the United States,  is Chinese Corporation.  The second that those pigs are there, they're just paying the farmer to raise them because  
**[1:04:49-1:05:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:04:49):**  they own the pigs.  There's none of that economic activity taking place out here in rural America.  China's the one benefiting from it now.  
**[1:05:00-1:05:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:05:00):**  And having 20 small family farms with a couple hundred pigs, you've got one mega farm that  employs two people instead of 20 small family farms and each one of those family farms is  going to go into town and they're going to support the grocery store, the auto parts  
**[1:05:15-1:05:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:05:15):**  store, the dealer, the grocery store, all the small businesses in town that make a small  business Main Street just hum.  My friend Steve Stratford, he loves to say, cows build towns.  
**[1:05:30-1:05:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:05:30):**  I don't want to exclude the pigs from that either, but you know, to some extent, pigs  build towns, cows build towns, not the finishing animals, the breeding animals.  That's what you got to have to build the town.  
**[1:05:42-1:06:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:05:42):**  In our area, we're in the corn belt.  In our area, it was sows or milk cows, they built the towns and when those disappeared,  it's kind of camouflaged how we've gutted rural America on the eastern side of the corn  
**[1:06:04-1:06:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:06:04):**  belt.  It's much clearer on the western side of the corn belt, because we still have lots of other  people that live in rural America, not as many because when I was in school, there was  
**[1:06:15-1:06:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:06:15):**  140 in my class in school, my kids, there was 90 in classes.  That's not as bad as the decline out in the western corn belt, but it's still a big decline.  And it's only going to accelerate here as our rural communities get older and don't  
**[1:06:33-1:06:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:06:33):**  have as many kids.  But you know, it's, we've lost huge amounts of our rural population.  I tell people the most valuable things that we've sent off from the farm has been our  
**[1:06:49-1:06:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:06:49):**  topsoil and our kids.  And we really ought to change both of those.  But we ought to bring the, we ought to bring the sows back.  
**[1:06:59-1:07:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:06:59):**  And I think the only realistic way we can do it is they have to be direct marketed because  there's not a realistic commodity market for independent hog farmers anymore.  And we ought to bring the milk cows back.  
**[1:07:13-1:07:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:07:13):**  But that's getting destroyed.  Now, my county is about half Amish.  And we still have a bunch of small, certified organic dairy farms.  
**[1:07:25-1:07:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:07:25):**  And they haven't told them that they're not picking up their milk, but they're running  them out of business because these small dairies that are actually certified organic dairies,  they can't compete with those 10 and 20,000 cow confinement dairies that are quote unquote  
**[1:07:43-1:07:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:07:43):**  organic by some certifier.  So I mean, our community is going to be destroyed the next county over from us, Stubeck County,  which is the farthest northeast county in Indiana.  
**[1:07:56-1:08:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:07:56):**  When I was young, there was 400 dairies in Stubeck County, some rolling ground guys added  value to, you know, because they planted forages, turned it into milk, fed their cows, raised  the family out of those 400.  
**[1:08:14-1:08:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:08:14):**  There's four left.  99% have disappeared in my lifetime.  You know, the feed mills are disappearing.  
**[1:08:28-1:08:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:08:28):**  The main streets are gone.  You know, so I mean, it's cheap, cheap food has real costs.  Real costs to rural America.  
**[1:08:41-1:09:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:08:41):**  Yes.  Yeah, the whole the whole concept was it did not work out for consumers from a food quality,  food choice, human health standpoint, didn't work out for farmers or rural America at all.  
**[1:09:02-1:09:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:09:02):**  And the whole myth that we're feeding the world, like, ah, that just it bothers me so  much now when I hear when I hear somebody say, Oh, well, I'm we're feeding the world  like okay, what are you getting ready to do?  
**[1:09:15-1:09:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:09:15):**  I'm getting my combine, we're gonna go combine some soybeans, like, oh, you're feeding cows  maybe in another part of the world, but you know, the soybeans are probably going to feed  cows, maybe pigs.  
**[1:09:27-1:09:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:09:27):**  How, like, how do we how do we shift away from this mindset and start talking about  what we're really growing in this country and what we're importing, what we're exporting  and and becoming more, more self sufficient, more food secure within our own borders.  
**[1:09:44-1:10:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:09:44):**  You know, I think it's a lot easier conversation to have with people since the pandemic, but  I still think it's a we've got a lot of work to do to be able to create a these local and  regional food systems that actually feed people rather than this quote unquote, feed the world.  
**[1:10:05-1:10:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:10:05):**  And you know, that whole feed the world thing is crazy anyways, because what we're really  doing is sending raw commodities to other places that have money because we're not sending  food to people that really need it.  
**[1:10:22-1:10:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:10:22):**  You know, the Environmental Working Group has showed all of that it's got some really  interesting data of where we actually export to.  The other thing is that these people don't want to talk about is that most years we're  
**[1:10:36-1:10:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:10:36):**  a net food importer.  We're not feeding the world.  We're, you know, and I live in Indiana.

Indiana brings in 90 percent of the food that we eat in Indiana.  We don't grow enough food here to say so.  
**[1:11:03-1:11:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:11:03):**  And we're one of the largest, most capable food producing areas in the world.  You know, the why is that and why aren't people really, really upset about that?  People should be like, hey, especially since Covid, people should be you know, we should

You know, we don't really sit down and enjoy food or not enough anyways.  
**[1:11:47-1:12:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:11:47):**  And, you know, our whole attitude around food and our whole attitude around this feed the  world and cheap food, all of that has to change.  And we have to actually value our rural communities and our rural communities, unlike what the

Farmers just say it like crazy.  And you know, you summed it up really well when you were talking about the whole connect

**[1:15:17-1:15:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:15:17):**  It's in actually moving the goods from the port.  Logistics, right?  Logistics like there aren't enough truck drivers or aren't enough people to unload the ships.  
**[1:15:26-1:15:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:15:26):**  Like, do you think that's going to do you think that's going to clear up soon?  Or do you think that's going to get worse?  Oh, I think it's going to get worse.  
**[1:15:33-1:15:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:15:33):**  And I think it's going to get worse because of partially because of labor.  But I think it's going to get worse.  The and it comes back to that whole concentration and consolidation.  
**[1:15:46-1:16:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:15:46):**  And where effective markets and where there's actually some competition in the marketplace.  You have people that are, you know, want to grow their business, go out and get some more  business.  
**[1:16:01-1:16:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:16:01):**  And I think the chicken industry right now is an excellent example.  Those guys got really, really short on labor.  And then they got really, really worried because if you look at the biology, chickens are probably  
**[1:16:15-1:16:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:16:15):**  one of the riskiest when you have shortages at your processing plant because Cornish cross  chicken can gain a pound a week.  So in in 10 days of processing or 10 days of slaughter at the plant, the chicken goes  
**[1:16:33-1:16:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:16:33):**  from being too small to way too big.  So if your plants closed down for a few days, you never get caught back up on chickens.  You know, cattle.  
**[1:16:42-1:16:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:16:42):**  Yeah, it takes a long time to get caught back up, but you're not euthanizing cattle, pigs,  the euthanize some of them, but you got a little bit bigger window.  And after they the chicken industry did that for a while, I'm 100% convinced that they  
**[1:16:59-1:17:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:16:59):**  figured out, hey, we don't have to try to cut each other's throats.  Let's just keep telling the world we don't have enough chicken and just keep jacking  the price up.  
**[1:17:12-1:17:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:17:12):**  Chicken that those guys are making an awful lot of money now to not even raising as many  chickens and not running their plants full.  And I don't think they have any desire to go back to full speed.  
**[1:17:26-1:17:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:17:26):**  We get the hog in the industry to the same way.  They'll do the same thing.  The Packers are doing it right now on the beef, you know, with their margins.  
**[1:17:40-1:17:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:17:40):**  You know, they're coming up with they're using COVID.  They're using every other kind of excuse.  Some of it's real.  
**[1:17:47-1:17:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:17:47):**  Fire cyber attack.  Right.  Some of it is real supply chain issues.  
**[1:17:54-1:18:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:17:54):**  And it's really hard to decipher.  And as you get industries that are way too consolidated, you know, the we come right  back to that thing of one individual entity can make decisions that is in their best financial  
**[1:18:09-1:18:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:18:09):**  interest to not do something rather than to do something.  And so is it all supply chain issues?  Or is it too much concentration?  
**[1:18:19-1:18:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:18:19):**  We learn from history, we should never let it get this concentrated.  And supply chain issues are going to be a problem.  But concentration is a bigger issue.  
**[1:18:28-1:18:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:18:28):**  Oh, but it'll be different this time, right?  It'll be different.  Yeah.  
**[1:18:32-1:18:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:18:32):**  Yeah.  That's always that's always the human condition trap.  It'll be different next time.  
**[1:18:38-1:18:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:18:38):**  We were smarter than we were then.  It'll be different next time.  Yeah.  
**[1:18:43-1:18:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:18:43):**  So, Greg, it's a man it's it's kind of flown by what the Is there anything you want to  know from me or CK since this is our first time together?  Yeah, nice to meet you.  
**[1:18:57-1:19:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:18:57):**  Yeah.  So what is it that you do that there now?  Your Twitter handle is what Redhill rancher?  
**[1:19:06-1:19:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:19:06):**  Yeah, red hills rancher.  It's you know, pretty consistent across all social media.  We do a podcast under ranching reboot.  
**[1:19:16-1:19:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:19:16):**  I guess I can tell a little bit of my story for those that don't know.  I am part owner and operator of a 7000 acre cattle ranch all native range.  I operate at fairly high stock densities frequent moves.  
**[1:19:31-1:19:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:19:31):**  I run some my own cattle mostly I run custom cattle through the summer.  I keep my own through the winter I've got got some custom cattle coming in this winter  as well.  
**[1:19:42-1:19:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:19:42):**  And I run Corriente, log horn cross cattle crossing with beef, beef bulls with anguses  generation and I've got some other bulls thinking about for the next couple generations.  So that's that's kind of me in a nutshell.  
**[1:19:58-1:20:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:19:58):**  Family my dad took over this place and I think 1980 Yeah, 85.  I came back from the Navy in 2006 started my grazing business in 2008.  By 2011 I was kind of running the whole place and since 2016 I've been running it pretty  
**[1:20:15-1:20:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:20:15):**  much one hand single handed.  How long is your grazing season out there?  I'm on green grass from about April 15 to October 15.  
**[1:20:25-1:20:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:20:25):**  So I get like a good solid 180 days of good green, good green grass.  And I'll get a lot of cool season growth through the winter time too.  So there's only about there's about 45 days in the late summer, early fall.  
**[1:20:40-1:20:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:20:40):**  And there's another 60 to 70 days in the winter where it's too cold to grow anything.  Okay.  And no sheep all cattle?  
**[1:20:49-1:20:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:20:49):**  No sheep all cattle.  Pretty sure the ranch is paid for with sheep back in the 30s because it has some sheep  fencing on it.  
**[1:20:57-1:21:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:20:57):**  Like okay, there's there's quite a bit of page wire fencing on it.  Some of the some of the urban legends and family legends say that the family paid for  a lot of it with sheep back in the 30s.  
**[1:21:09-1:21:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:21:09):**  You put a hundred cattle guys in a room, you'll normally have a hundred guys that would never  have sheep on their farm, right?  It's funny.  
**[1:21:18-1:21:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:21:18):**  Yeah.  We we really like ours.  It's it's weird.  
**[1:21:23-1:21:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:21:23):**  My dad and grandpa sold theirs and sold to use in 1968.  My dad still cusses about the things.  And I think these new fence chargers and black plastic pipe and them being hair sheep and  
**[1:21:38-1:21:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:21:38):**  not turning the rams in so that they don't land before the middle of April.  I mean, we we made a lot of drastic changes compared to what they did back in the day.  And they've honestly been really, really enjoyable.  
**[1:21:51-1:22:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:21:51):**  And you know, there that's a market where there's many buyers and many sellers and sheep  are actually bring decent money, making money.  Yeah.  
**[1:22:01-1:22:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:22:01):**  Yeah.  It's kind of it's kind of I mean, we've got sheep now, so maybe that'll probably change.  But, you know, watch the market collapse now.  
**[1:22:10-1:22:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:22:10):**  But it's been it's been fun to watch.  Sheep and goats are, you know, they're pretty they're pretty good moneymakers, from what  I understand.  
**[1:22:18-1:22:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:22:18):**  Hearing from everyone who's got cattle enterprises and sheep and goat, they're like the sheep  and goats are paid for the cattle to stay on the ranch, basically.  I think I've seen Conry's said it a couple times on working cows that, you know, that  
**[1:22:32-1:22:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:22:32):**  there's folks that keep the horses up front for the tourist, the cows around the house  from the neighbors and the sheep out back to pay for it all.  Yeah.  
**[1:22:42-1:22:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:22:42):**  Yeah.  Interesting.  Well, Greg, have we left anything else on the table today?  
**[1:22:50-1:22:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:22:50):**  Any any resources you want to share?  Any any place you want to send people anything you want to get off your chest?  Any big talking points you got?  
**[1:22:58-1:23:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:22:58):**  Anybody has questions about processing the I follow the niche meat processors assistance  network email listserv.  I think they're one of the best resources for anybody interested in direct marketing  
**[1:23:14-1:23:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:23:14):**  meat or especially for building or operating processing plants.  And then I always recommend everybody to join our my daughter and I have a Facebook group  politics from the pastures.  
**[1:23:31-1:23:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:23:31):**  We like to discuss all of these issues around, you know, the the big four that I brought  up the subsidies, the antitrust enforcement, the labeling issues, the inspection things  and any other issues globally that impact rural America, farmers, our food supply.  
**[1:23:56-1:24:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:23:56):**  Great.  And what's your Twitter handle?  Just I know what it is.  
**[1:24:01-1:24:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:24:01):**  I mean, we're friends, but tell me what it is so I can make sure I get it right in the  show notes.  That's a good question.  
**[1:24:07-1:24:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:24:07):**  I'm not really is it at G Guntherp?  I'm not sure.  You know, I'll I'll find out.  
**[1:24:14-1:24:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:24:14):**  I'll make sure I get your correct Twitter handle.  Yeah, because.  Yeah.  
**[1:24:18-1:24:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:24:18):**  I'm the I'm a much more civil and reserved person on Facebook than I am on Twitter.  I like to I like to drag everybody imaginable.  If I'm if I've got an issue, I don't got no problem tagging the secretary and tagging  
**[1:24:35-1:24:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:24:35):**  a couple of federal trade commissioners and some you name it.  I think where you go to get mad and sling poo at everybody.  Oh, yeah.  
**[1:24:44-1:24:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:24:44):**  Oh, yeah.  I kind of like it every once in a while.  It's kind of fun.  
**[1:24:47-1:24:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:24:47):**  I'm sure some of them are like, is there a way to unfollow this guy?  Where's that block button at?  Yeah.  
**[1:24:54-1:25:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:24:54):**  But, you know, legally, they can't do that, like the government speech, including the  Chekhov people have point that out to him every once in a while to some national pork  producers and the National Cattlemen's Beef Association.  
**[1:25:09-1:25:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:25:09):**  Trump got that Supreme Court thing.  As long as the government speech.  And so they like to try to block a farmer every once in a while.  
**[1:25:16-1:25:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:25:16):**  I'm like, no, I don't think you can do that, because if you guys aren't government speech,  those Chekhovs are unconstitutional because that's the only reason the Supreme Court said  you guys could still be around.  
**[1:25:26-1:25:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:25:26):**  Probably better to block them.  Then tag bag marketing service to point it out to USDA.  Be like, hey, can you check into this?  
**[1:25:37-1:25:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:25:37):**  You probably have a fan club over there.  Oh, yeah.  I need a few more so that we get a few more people raise the bell with them.  
**[1:25:46-1:25:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:25:46):**  Well, I'll come help you raise a little bit of hell on Twitter.  Okay, that'll be fun.  CK, do you have anything?  
**[1:25:54-1:26:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:25:54):**  No, I'm just pretty.  I'm interested to see how the supply shortage conversation plays out.  I think that kind of like adversity through a lot of the ranches who have become successful  
**[1:26:06-1:26:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:26:06):**  is because they were forced to shut down or pivot their model.  It's created more resiliency.  So I'm really interested to see what the good side of things comes with supply shortages  
**[1:26:19-1:26:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:26:19):**  and people really kind of unveiling their food system.  Where there's opportunity.  I mean, there's opportunity there.  
**[1:26:31-1:26:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:26:31):**  There's opportunities in the future for local food systems.  It's been a great episode.  I think that's a good place to end.  
**[1:26:40-1:26:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:26:40):**  You guys have a great week.  We'll catch you later.  Yeah.  
**[1:26:43-1:27:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/35-Greg-Gunthorp-Food-Security-is-National-Security-e18ttas#t=1:26:43):**  Thank you.

I've been getting a lot of questions lately about other enterprises on the ranch and other  things that you can do to concessionize things on the ranch.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:01:22):**  And this kind of ties in with a larger conversation of succession.  So today I've got something a little bit special for you, kind of a two-part show.  So make sure you stick around toward the end.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:01:31):**  We're going to talk about the history of Blackleg Ranch and some of the ways that the Doane  family has found to get the younger generation interested to come back to the ranch and be  a part of the ranching family and ranching community.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:01:44):**  To kick this off, we've got the patriarch of the Doane family and CEO of Blackleg Ranch,  Jerry Doane, with us today to give us a history and to talk about Blackleg Ranch.  So Jerry Doane, welcome to Ranching Reboot.  
**[0:01:57-0:02:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:01:57):**  Thanks.  Glad to be here.  Great to finally get you here, get a little bit of a late start, but that's okay.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:02:06):**  So for our listeners, I've known Jerry now for probably five or six years from the conference  circuit.  I think the first time I met you, I don't even want to say because I'll probably screw  
**[0:02:19-0:02:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:02:19):**  it up, but we've done, we've done regenerate.  We've been at regenerate together.  We've been at soil health together.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:02:25):**  We've been at SRM together and at several places.  And recently you had me up to North Dakota to speak at the North Dakota Grazing Land  Coalition succession planning workshop.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:02:37):**  And man, you guys really put on a fantastic event up there, like the Grazing Land Coalition.  You guys have got it going on.  So I really, I kind of wanted to do this in person while I was there.  
**[0:02:53-0:03:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:02:53):**  And honestly, I think that, I think the meal that we shared and the friendship that we  had up there was a lot better and I'm more than happy to have you on the show today.  So welcome, Jerry.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:03:04):**  Well, it sounds sad.  We had a good time.  We really appreciate you coming to North Dakota.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:03:09):**  The feedback's been tremendous on you and the whole event.  We just did a wrap up with Starry and Bank, the Grazing Coalition on zoom this morning  and just super positive response from lots of folks signed up with Freedom Financial  
**[0:03:28-0:03:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:03:28):**  to take their operation further.  I think they had 66 people out of that group sign up.  That's like 85% or more that signed up.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:03:42):**  I mean, that's huge.  That's what we wanted.  We wanted to present something and then let them take it further.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:03:49):**  And I guess they did.  So it's great.  Hopefully I've got an episode coming up with the Freedom Financial folks so we can learn  
**[0:03:59-0:04:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:03:59):**  some more about that.  And I can bring some of that knowledge that I got up in North Dakota and bring that back.  Tell us about Blackleg Ranch.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:04:09):**  Where are you at?  Well, I'll give you a history to start out with.  My great grandfather was a Canadian citizen and in 1880, his father died and him and his  
**[0:04:25-0:04:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:04:25):**  mother came down to the United States, ended up in Kansas down in your neck of the woods.  And we're not sure, we don't know a lot about that story, but then we know he ended up back  in Dakota, what was still Dakota Territory and he shows up in some newspaper articles  
**[0:04:45-0:04:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:04:45):**  and things and actually homesteaded in Southern Burley County.  We're just on the east side of Missouri River.  And it was a little bit of a wild time back then, I guess.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:04:58):**  There's still Indian things going on.  And I always say they lived in a sod house.  We've got an actual picture of the sod house.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:05:08):**  And as crazy and challenging as we think the world is today, I don't know if it still compares  to trying to stay warm and put food on the table in the middle of the Northern Plains.  They'd probably laugh at us in our first world problems right now.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:05:25):**  Yeah, exactly.  But so then he had a daughter that was sickly, had lung problems and they moved to California.  My grandfather took over.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:05:37):**  And he bought land for a dollar an acre when people said, you're an idiot.  It's way too high.  It'll never work.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:05:44):**  And he did struggle.  He took the fence down on two quarters twice because he thought he was going to lose it  and then put it back up again and worked off the ranch doing different things to try to  
**[0:05:58-0:06:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:05:58):**  make ends meet.  But he gave us a foundation to carry on with.  And then it went to my dad who was maybe more of the caretaker of that generation.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:06:09):**  They went through the tough times in the 30s.  They were afraid to step out a little bit, rightfully so.  They saw how tough it was and the depression.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:06:19):**  And then I come along, fresh out of college, think I got all the answers and went through  the 80s and dang lucky I'm still here because things were going haywire.  I tell the story of half dozen people I really admired because they had a roll of equipment  
**[0:06:39-0:06:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:06:39):**  out in front of the shop and all this neat stuff.  And there's not one of those guys I'm thinking about are still in business.  The 80s got them.  
**[0:06:48-0:07:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:06:48):**  We watched our equity eroding and I thought my God if I'm the generation that loses this  I won't be able to handle it.  You know I'll be hanging by a tree somewhere.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:07:01):**  And then I went through Savory's school here, Holistic Management.  And Savory's a little different individual.  Jay Fear always tells the story.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:07:18):**  Always like Jesus if you ask him a question he answers with another question.  There's a lot of truth to that.  And I struggled with it a bit.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:07:27):**  I was you know the way we're taught Brian in higher education we're taught in black  and white.  You and I have had this discussion.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:07:36):**  And I think we do a bit of a disservice.  And I was the same way.  Just give me the answer and I'll go apply it and live happily ever after.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:07:45):**  But we all know Holistic Management and Regenerative Egg is nothing like that.  It's all gray and life is like that.  It's not black and white.  
**[0:07:53-0:08:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:07:53):**  It's gray.  And once we get our mindset straight on that we've got a lot more opportunity to be successful.  And I went home from that.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:08:04):**  Started to divide a couple of big pastures into some smaller ones.  But still was kind of confused.  Went back through Holistic Management again.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:08:14):**  And then it started to kind of all clicked.  And I guess the rest is history.  Not that I have all the answers.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:08:22):**  It's a constant learning curve.  But we've seen our profitability really change here.  And we worked at our you know our two major holistic goals are bringing profitability  
**[0:08:34-0:08:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:08:34):**  back and improving our quality of life.  And I mean our quality of life isn't perfect every day.  But at least we work at that.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:08:42):**  Try to make it fun again.  Most people in agriculture, I shouldn't say most, but a lot I know, they don't have fun.  They work their butt off and you know kind of complain about it.  
**[0:08:53-0:09:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:08:53):**  But they do the same thing over and over.  It's very traditional.  And there's nothing on this place that's traditional anymore.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:09:00):**  And so we try to have fun with it.  We have our challenges.  We are a family.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:09:05):**  I you know my wife Renee and I think we're still in control.  But our three boys aren't you know they're not sure we are.  And they're trying to make sure we're not.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:09:15):**  And you know I'm really proud to have three boys that came back to our ranch.  They went all into college across the country.  And my daughter, she's not directly involved but helps them.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:09:27):**  And they all came back to North Dakota and wanted to be involved in agriculture and be  involved in this ranch.  That's really exciting.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:09:34):**  But much as we learned in this succession school, and we know that family dynamics are  a challenge, and we're really working at that hard to make sure that we protect this legacy  and hopefully can turn over to the next generation.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:09:50):**  Great stuff.  Great stuff.  So tell me about the ranch.  
**[0:09:54-0:10:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:09:54):**  Like how big is it?  And you know what kind of critters are you growing on that place?  Well it's a pretty good sized place.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:10:01):**  It's 20,000 acres.  And we run a lot of cattle and buffalo.  And you know we're very intensive managed on our grassland.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:10:13):**  And we've seen a huge improvement in that.  You know when I was a kid it was season-long grazing.  And I'm not trying to be critical of those generations.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:10:24):**  They did what they thought was right.  But we're just like I said on the east side of the Missouri River.  And we've got some real sandy hilly land.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:10:35):**  And that was all bare soil.  You know bare, we used a dirt bike in it.  It was a lot of fun.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:10:41):**  And there wasn't anything.  And what grass was there was blue grama grass.  A lot of short.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:10:46):**  The diversity was very narrow.  And when we went in there with a lot of cattle, short duration, high animal impact, and then  got them out and then mother nature is good enough to give you a little moisture.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:10:59):**  Man we've got big bluestem just climbed those slopes.  And there was no big bluestem that I could find left.  And yet it came from the seedbed.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:11:07):**  I always tell the story, groups will come here and say well how did you get that big  bluestem?  I said well we took a big John Deere interceder and went out there in the middle of those  
**[0:11:18-0:11:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:11:18):**  hills and then laughed because it's not true.  But the diversity came back.  And I'm proud of that because those hills, yeah they're still a bare spot here and there  
**[0:11:27-0:11:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:11:27):**  but it used to be all bare.  And now it's covered.  And so all that management and those cattle, you know, hired.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:11:36):**  And it's what the buffalo did in the northern plains.  It's what the buffalo did.  If you read Lewis and Clark's journals, they tell the story of the grasslands were abundant  
**[0:11:47-0:11:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:11:47):**  and saddle high.  Why was that?  It was those massive herds coming through, stimulating the ground, eating the grass,  
**[0:11:56-0:12:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:11:56):**  not very selective.  And then but not coming back for a year or two or three and you had that long rest and  recovery and you had these abundant grasslands.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:12:05):**  And so then we come along and we season one graze and we constant overgrazing, undergrazing,  the diversity narrows.  And you don't notice that if you're there every day looking at it but leave for three  
**[0:12:19-0:12:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:12:19):**  or four years and come back and then go wow this is going wrong, you know.  You hit on something there that you know a lot of us kind of independently arrived at.  Bunch them up, high density, very short duration for a graze but a long rest period.

But like what are we talking about?  
**[0:12:50-0:13:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:12:50):**  We're talking half a grazing season, a full year, half a grazing season of rest?  Yeah I mean and in our situation up here in the northern plains, I like once over.  For the benefit of the land, once over is the best.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:13:08):**  But I'll qualify that because we've learned if you're after performance then you're gonna  have to modify that.  You know in your country where you have a longer growing season you can do things a  
**[0:13:20-0:13:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:13:20):**  little different than we can.  But what I've learned is okay if we're in a once over system and we get into August,  you've got a lot of material out there, a lot of forage but it's pretty mature and the  
**[0:13:33-0:13:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:13:33):**  quality is dropping off.  And what I was struggling with when we were grazing yearlings or anything that you want  to you know put more gain on, they're dropping off on you.  
**[0:13:44-0:14:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:13:44):**  So then what I and we use the nutritional balancer program out of Texas to test this.  And so then we went to something that had maybe 75 days rest on and you had more green  lush material in it.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:14:00):**  And we were able to kick heifers that we tested up a whole pound a day.  And that was huge and it was finally I said wow then we can because I was always struggling.  Guys would compare between intensive grazing and season long.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:14:17):**  Well season long where they can select they're always going to do a little better.  You know if you don't care about what you're doing to the land and if you're renting the  land like these guys were what do they care it's not their deal you know.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:14:29):**  And I was trying to prove that we could do these systems and keep the performance up.  And if you're after that performance that's what we have to do.  But even then you know we can't go you know you get into Missouri or some of those areas  
**[0:14:45-0:14:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:14:45):**  where they can maybe rotate in 40 days or 45.  We can't do that but we can and you don't want to do it on all of them it's 75.  But generally they do it once a year and they're going to have 300 because they're probably  
**[0:14:58-0:15:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:14:58):**  only going to be in there three or four days.  So they're going to have 300 and what's that 350 or 360 days of rest you know on half of  that winter time of course.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:15:10):**  But then we'll take some pastures if we're looking like particularly with our peppers  and those sorts of things and go into something that's 60, 75 days rest something like that.  But don't do that on the same ones every year mix it up and it works really well so if that  
**[0:15:27-0:15:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:15:27):**  helps you.  Oh and I found a lot of those same things out too like and mixing it up not applying  the same grazing pressure the same paddock year after year after year especially at the  
**[0:15:38-0:15:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:15:38):**  same time of year you know shift that you know try to shift that to a different season  so you can you know encourage a different variety of plants.  I've noticed big changes since I started doing that you know in the plant community you know  
**[0:15:51-0:16:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:15:51):**  just always doing something a little bit different with the grazing pressure and with the timing.  Yeah change it up a little.  For sure.  
**[0:16:02-0:16:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:16:02):**  So how many I guess I kind of want to ask like how many paddocks do you guys have and  like how often are you really moving your stock?  Well we've got like a hundred pastures now you know pastures paddocks depends on who  
**[0:16:18-0:16:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:16:18):**  you're talking to what term makes them feel good.  Right permanently fenced though.  Yeah yeah yeah and then we're moving every one to five, six, seven days.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:16:32):**  We've got a couple pastures still 250 acres or so average is more around 80 or so we're  trying to you know to me and I always qualify this with people because I had the same question  somebody was interviewing me the other day you know they put guys like you or me or others  
**[0:16:52-0:17:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:16:52):**  on the so-called pedestal and and you've got to graze like they do if you're going to be  good you got to be like they are and I'm like that really is nothing to do with it.  I mean find what works for you and if moving once a month is doing what fits your goals  
**[0:17:11-0:17:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:17:11):**  and you're improving the rangeland and you like what it's doing then be happy and it's  kind of what I started out at and then I think I can do a little better here divide again  divide again divide again.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:17:26):**  Now I'm not a mob grazer I've been on places like that that are moving cattle every hour  or two and I'm impressed with what it does.  I don't want to spend my life in the past year you know and I'm not saying that's you  
**[0:17:40-0:17:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:17:40):**  can't do that or hire somebody or whatever and and we're we're way further now than I  ever thought I would be but it's a process and if you're not ready you can't start out  with season-long grazing and go to mob grazing and think that's a great deal because it's  
**[0:17:57-0:18:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:17:57):**  it'll put you upside down you got to take this I think in baby steps now we can go faster  and try to get there quicker but if you take it a bit slow you're going to feel way better  about where you've been and how you're getting there and where you're at but I truly believe  
**[0:18:14-0:18:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:18:14):**  you find what works for you and then be happy with it and don't you know who cares what  Brian Alexander, Jerry Downer, anybody else is doing don't worry about that if your profitability  is going where you want your quality life's going where you want your improvement in the  
**[0:18:28-0:18:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:18:28):**  range line is going where you want and then watch it over time if you decide hey I think  I can do better then go for it.  I agree with that like and I think a lot of the so-called gurus and I don't think I'd  
**[0:18:41-0:19:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:18:41):**  put myself in that group thank you I think a lot of the so-called gurus I'm not saying  they aren't experts but maybe they aren't quite as expert outside of their zip code  you know just because something works in you know South Florida does that doesn't mean  
**[0:19:02-0:19:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:19:02):**  it's going to work in Georgia just because something works here in Kansas doesn't mean  it's going to work there in North Dakota I think we can maybe look at you know maybe  80% of the stuff I do here will work there but then again you get a thing like yes is  
**[0:19:18-0:19:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:19:18):**  moving cows every day at high stock densities better for the land we all agree yes that  is better that's also a huge time commitment and talking about doing it you know four or  five times a day it's a huge time commitment and on you know when you're on a 20,000 or  
**[0:19:35-0:19:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:19:35):**  7,000 or 10,000 acre ranch and you've got multiple irons in the fire you have to consider  all those things you know the situation can look a lot different if you're on 480 acres  with 100 cows in Missouri you know that's an entirely different story than trying to  
**[0:19:51-0:20:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:19:51):**  move your cows five times a day in you know western Kansas or in southern North Dakota  right you're right well and the principles are the same but you have to adapt them to  your operation yeah you know that's a big thing and people come you know I've run into  
**[0:20:08-0:20:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:20:08):**  people and they go well yeah that's great but it won't work in my area which is only  100 miles away from here and I'm like yeah adapt it though the principles are the same  you just have to adapt them to yours what are your resources what what what are your  
**[0:20:25-0:20:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:20:25):**  goals all that stuff and and if you do all that it all works because guys are looking  for that magic bullet though they're looking for the magic bullet or they just want somebody  to hand them a recipe card that they can follow do this and do this apply this fertilizer  
**[0:20:40-0:21:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:20:40):**  use this seed do this do this do this harvest drop profit well it's what we said early on  we all look for black and white just give me the textbook answer tell me what page number  I'll look it up it says graze this many cows that many days and you have profitability  
**[0:21:00-0:21:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:21:00):**  success hey great that's what I'll do sounds really easy doesn't it yeah but it doesn't  work that way it'd be nice if it would you know yeah there's no there's no grazing manual  there's no land restoration manual maybe we can say that you know the start of some of  
**[0:21:21-0:21:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:21:21):**  that land restoration manual might be in holistic management you know the the framework of it's  in there nobody's written it yet yeah well because it's subjective and it's like I was  telling this reporter the other day I mean I can look like the greatest manager in the  
**[0:21:39-0:21:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:21:39):**  world and mother nature will make me look like the biggest idiot in the world because  she's constantly changing it up and so you've got to constantly adapt and use your head  and part of our problem in the world today is we're taught to not think you know we're  
**[0:21:53-0:22:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:21:53):**  taught to again textbook answers uh and I know this because I struggled with it for  a big chunk of my life because you forget how to think and I think that's part I really  believe higher ed does a disservice that they don't somehow try to pull that together a  
**[0:22:15-0:22:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:22:15):**  bit you know teach even if you never graze the cow teach holistic management because  it just teaches you how to think  without going completely off the rails here the quote that comes to mind  
**[0:22:31-0:22:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:22:31):**  the quote that comes to mind is is no government will ever give you the education necessary  to overthrow it there you go  that would be the that's the thought that comes to mind talking about uh why don't they  
**[0:22:52-0:23:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:22:52):**  teach this stuff in college yeah no there's a lot of truth  so let's uh let's talk about your grass fed operations and the bison like I'm interested  like cows are obvious how did you guys get the bison  
**[0:23:08-0:23:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:23:08):**  yeah you you say bison and the next guy says buffalo and I'll give you an argument over  that right away even with my boys they and my daughter she says dad there is enough there  is not a buffalo on this continent and I'm like did you tell the Indians that because  
**[0:23:29-0:23:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:23:29):**  every place I said it's not bison bill it's buffalo bill and it's even the the north dakota  association is the north dakota buffalo association so you know I laugh about it all and so I  tend to like the historical so I tend to call them buffalo more and so what I've kind of  
**[0:23:49-0:24:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:23:49):**  come to when I'm talking about them on the range they're buffalo when I talk about them  in the meat now they're bison so I just confuse everybody that way but okay you gotta have  a little you gotta have a little fun with all this craziness we go through but well  
**[0:24:03-0:24:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:24:03):**  I've always uh you know in the bison industry or buffalo industry however we want to call  it it's been a bit like that and you well know this I mean back when it was cool to  be in it and then everybody got in it and a lot of folks took a bloodbath and but we  
**[0:24:20-0:24:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:24:20):**  didn't have at that point in time the markets weren't keeping up with the production that's  not the case now now we got into it my two boys Jeremy my oldest boy that runs the hunting  operation and Jay's the one that runs the uh the cattle and the buffalo they and it  
**[0:24:41-0:25:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:24:41):**  was kind of fun because they were actually together on this and and it was because we  had hunters that come here that wanted to hunt buffalo and uh Jeremy said what do you  think about getting into this I think we can do some hunts on the side and then Jay's kind  
**[0:25:00-0:25:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:25:00):**  of thought I think we could uh there's you know there's a niche again it's a niche market  of a lean protein product and and you go after the health side of it and and so that's how  that's why we got into it and it started out we had Jay's had a really good friend that  
**[0:25:22-0:25:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:25:22):**  we kind of got into we custom grazed a few for him and and then got some animals and  grew and expanded and it's expanded pretty rapidly and and uh the hunt part's been good  I mean it's not going to pay the whole bill and we're just to the point now where we've  
**[0:25:41-0:25:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:25:41):**  got quite a few on on a forage diet and you know we can't put them all in our meat uh  business where we're growing but we're not there yet so we're selling some and then we're  running some through the plant up in New Rockford the buffalo plant we hauled a load down to  
**[0:25:58-0:26:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:25:58):**  brush Colorado right now it's hard to get them into these plants there's enough production  going on and well it's no different in the beef business we don't have very many smaller  plants out there and it's anybody that's in this business at all struggles so so that's  
**[0:26:15-0:26:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:26:15):**  why we got into it I guess or how we got into it and you know they're a majestic animal  I just love you know I can look at the cows out on the hills and they're cool too but  when I drive by that buffalo herd out on the hills I gotta stop snap a few pictures every  
**[0:26:30-0:26:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:26:30):**  time because it's just first it takes you back to what it must have been like when Lewis  and Clark or the settlers came here and those you know I mean we've got quite a few buffalo  but nothing like that it had to be just immaculate to see three or four hundred thousand head  
**[0:26:48-0:27:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:26:48):**  up on hills and stuff you know so it would have been a sight to see so yeah how many  do you have like a couple hundred well we've got we've got 300 cows and then we've got  another 300 that we're feeding up on roughage here so we've got quite a few now so okay  
**[0:27:10-0:27:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:27:10):**  so I was just wondering if you had like enough that were in a herd that you could maybe make  some observations about how the buffalo use forage versus how the cattle use forage yeah  and you know it's kind of interesting how they well first off they handle weather so  
**[0:27:29-0:27:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:27:29):**  much better you know it's fun you know you just watch cows and they're all huddled behind  the trees those buffalo are standing out there on the tallest butte just hunkered down taking  it you know and and of course you don't what's good about them is you don't do anything with  
**[0:27:43-0:28:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:27:43):**  them because you can't really you're not going to pull a calf out of a buffalo that wouldn't  unless you don't want to live long or whatever yeah that's probably a high street observation  yeah well and it kind of goes with you know we've gotten to where we do less with the  
**[0:28:00-0:28:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:28:00):**  cattle than we used to because it's the holistic approach it's try to select so that you don't  have to and and once you change calving and you're doing it at the right time of the year  you don't you know I I I drug a lot of calves in February March in a barn and when I was  
**[0:28:16-0:28:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:28:16):**  young thought it was fun I don't think it's that fun and I would never do that again but  but uh yeah the buffalo graze a little different they're less selective I would say you know  they'll eat more and not that you know we're not like Nebraska we don't have cedar trees

**[0:28:53-0:29:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:28:53):**  ask me how do you keep them in they'll stay in fine with a three-wire fence if they've  got feed and water and you're not putting pressure on them yep anything puts pressure  on them they're going to rip it down and be gone so every new fence on that part of the  
**[0:29:07-0:29:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:29:07):**  ranch where they are we put in we put in seven foot posts and six wires and and then it's  really good but we don't have it all that way and so you know we're a little uh you  got to pay a little more attention but they're you know they're not they're not hard to work  
**[0:29:26-0:29:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:29:26):**  with but if you get them in a corral and you're trying to wean the calves off or whatever  buffalo get excited and they get a little jumpy and and you really gotta learn to you  can't hoot and holler you know and not you shouldn't be doing that with cattle either  
**[0:29:43-0:30:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:29:43):**  but a lot of people do that's you don't do that with buffalo or you're gonna have a mess  you've got to be a low stress stockman with with bison oh absolutely do you do you work  cattle and bison in the same facility no we've tried but we uh you know on that we're building  
**[0:30:05-0:30:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:30:05):**  up the facility we put up we've got some sorting pens that are 10 foot tall now with guard  rail just when we bring them in that we can hold them good and you know everything needs  to just be taller because they'll test it they that's what they do and so you know some  
**[0:30:26-0:30:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:30:26):**  of the really good tubs cattle tubs you can probably get by on a smaller buffalo you can  the bigger the bigger cows and the bigger bulls they'll jump a seven foot you know i've  seen them do it they you know it's you need a little more uh just a little better facility  
**[0:30:45-0:31:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:30:45):**  and we're we're constantly improving that we're not where we want to be on that yet  but we we've got some stuff now so we can take care of most stuff so it seems like you  have to have it 10 feet because they know they can clear seven and probably and maybe  
**[0:31:01-0:31:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:31:01):**  get hung up but they know they can't clear 10 so they're going to look for that other  escape yeah yeah that's right yeah i i've never been around bison being worked or like  a big even like a big bison roundup i'm ted one of ted turner's ranches is just 15 miles  
**[0:31:21-0:31:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:31:21):**  south of here yeah and i'm good friends with the managers that'd be a that'd be something  to see you know i you know took a tour of the triple seven bison ranch i think that  was about a year and a half ago had him on the podcast a couple months ago that's mort's  
**[0:31:36-0:31:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:31:36):**  espy from down there yeah i know i know him and we got to look at their facility and oh  wow i mean yeah they got a base facility it's nice it's it's a lot of iron yeah that's for  sure well the thing is they they really want to be in the herd so when you're messing with  
**[0:31:56-0:32:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:31:56):**  them sorting they just want to be back with the herd and they'll do whatever they can  to try to get back with the herd you know they they're very instinctive herding animal  and you know i suppose i mean cows are but we've kind of messed them up over year over  
**[0:32:12-0:32:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:32:12):**  years and they're not as good as buffalo are so i i'd agree with that observation about  the cows mine stick together pretty well as as a group yeah and you know i've had this  group together for about a year and i ran with some partner cows so there's about say  
**[0:32:30-0:32:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:32:30):**  60 in my you know 60 run running cows in my group plus the heifers and yearlings in the  heifer development program in heifer development program in air quotes we could talk about  that one later but we coming you know i co-mingled with some partner cows and there was a lot  
**[0:32:48-0:33:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:32:48):**  of times where i'd see two-thirds of mine in a group with some of his and they'd be  off by themselves and then there'd be another big group of the rest of his and the rest  of mine off somewhere else and since they've all left they had to take his home mine are  
**[0:33:05-0:33:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:33:05):**  all sticking together they're always in a group and i started calving just a few days  ago and it's real easy to spot because they'll be all of them in one spot and one about 50  yards away be like yep we got another baby right now yeah yep you bet so tell us about  
**[0:33:23-0:33:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:33:23):**  your cows jerry tell us about the cow herd what uh what kind of cows do you guys run  well it's an angus-based herd you know we've been uh i guess i can tell you a story because  you i don't know if you've ever heard it maybe you have when i spoke because everybody wants  
**[0:33:42-0:34:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:33:42):**  to know how did how did the ranch ever get named black leg ranch because we know there's  a cattle disease it was my grandfather brought the first angus cattle to southern north korea  and around about 1930 and we were predominantly herford country in here and they hated those  
**[0:34:01-0:34:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:34:01):**  black cattle they were they were wilder than most and you know it just they weren't they  weren't red and white and people hated them and so the that's not what's happened that's  just not what we do around here we have red cows here that's right and and they just didn't  
**[0:34:21-0:34:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:34:21):**  like them and so the joke was they were them black-legged s o bs and my grandfather was  kind of a character he did everything with an airplane and and uh chased cattle with  it checked them all chased them and so that made him even wilder and so he decided to  
**[0:34:40-0:34:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:34:40):**  name it that because everybody said they were the black-legged s o bs it became the black  leg ranch and so i always thought growing up i don't know if i like the name and and  now i mean there's too much history in it it's gonna have to stay because it is a it's  
**[0:34:55-0:35:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:34:55):**  a good story and he named it and so we better honor him with it so that's kind of catchy  brand's good you guys have a good logo yeah yeah it all kind of fits together now but  so anyway that's where the black cows came from and uh like like most people and our  
**[0:35:16-0:35:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:35:16):**  cows weren't super big but you know this well what's what's the graph for cow size in in  the united states it's just on a big big go up up up up and uh one day i actually there  was a vet here and he uh he said to me i just came from a place and we were weighing all  
**[0:35:39-0:35:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:35:39):**  the cows and he said they were averaging 2 000 pounds and he said i said to the producer  can you show me your thousand pound calves because he said you know we'd like to get  50 out of these cows and he said he looked at the ground and i'm not trying to run him  
**[0:35:59-0:36:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:35:59):**  down that's not my point i'm just trying to make a point about cow size because he obviously  didn't have any and you know and if you can make this all work and regenerative egg and  trying to cut inputs on 2 000 pound cows god bless you i can't do it here and so our cows  
**[0:36:19-0:36:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:36:19):**  were not near that but we had to bring them down i want about 1100 pound cow because see  our goal is to never feed a bale of hay in the northern plains to a cow now that's a  challenge because we get ugly weather but that's what we try to do and we grow a lot  
**[0:36:35-0:36:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:36:35):**  of cover crops to graze through the winter months and when it all works right it'll cut  two three hundred dollars off from our bill on a cow that's huge as you're trying to bring  your profitability back and then bring these young the next generation back to an operation  
**[0:36:57-0:37:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:36:57):**  so we actually went in and used some you know it used to be low line but now it's avradine  because we wanted to bring them down quicker and and it did and we and because of the grass  finish side of it those avradine cattle generally finish a little better and i'm not i don't  
**[0:37:17-0:37:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:37:17):**  care what breed you used to do it it's just you've got to find something and for those  of you that may not know what the avradine was it was basically developed in australia  they just took the the bigger angus sent them one way in the smaller angus and sent them  
**[0:37:32-0:37:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:37:32):**  another way and it became that that breed they're very uh uh you know they're very efficient  got a lot of positive traits and they're just smaller and for us to bring the size down  it worked pretty good now there was some that were too small you kind of got to weed through  
**[0:37:50-0:38:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:37:50):**  all that but it allowed us to get these cow size down we'd i wouldn't say we're all perfect  at there's still a few cows that are still a little on the big side but when we're trying  to graze them in a winter scenario when it's you know here can be 20 below and we're grazing  
**[0:38:08-0:38:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:38:08):**  cover crops and all that we just can't do it with something we got to put all these  inputs in and all this feed in it just kills us and the biggest cost for guys in northern  plains well pretty much the whole cattle industry but particularly the northern plains is these  
**[0:38:22-0:38:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:38:22):**  feet winter feed costs they kill you and so anyway at feed cost and cat appreciation that's  like exactly so any way we can do to trim that even if you you know even say it's a  terrible year and you can only take two or three months off that's still a big savings  
**[0:38:41-0:38:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:38:41):**  but we've greatest these cows on cover crops through 200 year snow falls just fine make  them dig for it now it didn't all come at once and and so they do find we've but we've  also had some years where we had problems we had one year about three years ago we had  
**[0:38:59-0:39:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:38:59):**  75 inches and it came all in three weeks and we had three blizzards and you couldn't drive  across our place with a tractor and that's a problem of snow yeah and it was yeah and  it was it was tough and we lost some cattle and it frustrates you but in the big picture  
**[0:39:22-0:39:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:39:22):**  it was still more profitable than the other way and now what we do there is we don't bring  them home anymore we never bring them to the crown because most crowds on most ranches  are in a drainage and where does that end up in our case the missouri river we have  
**[0:39:41-0:39:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:39:41):**  a perception problem and why are we allowing that to happen let's not let's not give let's  give the consumer what he wants let's do a good job and so we keep those cows out on  the land we take the hay out there because then the manure and the urine is building  
**[0:39:58-0:40:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:39:58):**  soil health for us improving our uh our crop land and and uh and then it's also these cover  crops are a good food source for wildlife and it's improving our wildlife it's a win-win  our three goals in that whole scenario are bring that soil health back get rid of those  
**[0:40:17-0:40:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:40:17):**  winter feed costs and propagate the wildlife and we've been fairly successful on all three  of those now you can't just well you can you can go sell all your hanging equipment but  you need to buy some or do something because you got to have a backup plan you know remember  
**[0:40:34-0:40:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:40:34):**  where you live you live in the northern plains if it gets ugly but we went from putting up  five six thousand big round bales to putting up a thousand or less and for four or five  years they sat in a hay yard the boys asked me why have we got all that hay i said it's  
**[0:40:50-0:41:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:40:50):**  our insurance policy well then we had a couple ugly years and we fed it all up and i said  see there it is you have to have it for when you need it and uh but that's been a huge  thing for us on bringing profitability back getting rid of those winter feed costs and  
**[0:41:11-0:41:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:41:11):**  and and when you do that of course if you're calving in february or march it might not  work as well because then you're catching them in a bad time in the try and you're going  to be the third trimester when they're out there in the middle of that so we moved to  
**[0:41:26-0:41:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:41:26):**  may and june works really good and and uh she's gonna a lot of green grass in may and  june yeah yeah and and just makes the whole system work we've gotten rid of a whole lot  of work for us and and you know there's a lot of days when well you don't have to start  
**[0:41:43-0:42:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:41:43):**  a tractor most of the time and you know unless you got to push a little snow somewhere around  the water tank or whatever now those you know second and early third trimester cows are  a lot easier to bring through the winter than a baby calf like the safest place for a calf  
**[0:42:00-0:42:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:42:00):**  in the snowstormer one of those blizzards where you get six feet of snow is still in  the calf warmer that's exactly right and i think it's kind of relevant you know we're  we're getting ready to shake off winter and come into spring and most of the country and  
**[0:42:17-0:42:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:42:17):**  by the time this episode comes out i think it will be spring there was a friend of ours  that caught a little bit of heat on social media for saying that if you're a rancher  and you're out calving in january and february don't be bragging about it like you're not  
**[0:42:35-0:42:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:42:35):**  really a hero think about what you're really doing and why like it makes a lot more sense  to calve on green grass yeah and then cue that you know well we do it this way because  because because because because it just it's always made so much more sense to calve on  
**[0:42:52-0:43:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:42:52):**  green grass i i'll admit i'm calving right now at the beginning of march it's a little  bit early gotta back that back up like gonna be first of april next year for sure yeah  well and you're also quite a bit different climate than we are but you know this i mean  
**[0:43:12-0:43:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:43:12):**  there's lots of guys calving right now and and they they don't like it and they complain  about it and i'm like well why don't you change but it's it's that we are so traditional in  agriculture and the fear of change i had the same thing i changed 20 i don't know it's  
**[0:43:30-0:43:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:43:30):**  got to be 22 23 years ago when i changed i and i changed because my dad had just passed  away and my hired man had been with us for a number of years had had passed away my boys  were off in school and i said this isn't fun anymore and if i don't change i'm gonna quit  
**[0:43:51-0:44:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:43:51):**  because i don't like it and i went to the because i'm graduated north coast state university  i went the animal head of animal sciences department there and i said will you send  me all the research on calving say june or may june you know summer late spring early  
**[0:44:08-0:44:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:44:08):**  summer calving i got a half a page there was nothing out there and i'm like why don't we  even look at this stuff but again and i'm not trying to be critical of our research  institutions but again we go down that traditional path and we just discount well that would  
**[0:44:27-0:44:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:44:27):**  be dumb because you're going to have little calves i get that but they're alive if your  profitability went up if your quality of life improved and you'll have to market them a  different way you can't just probably pull them off the cow and sell them that may not  
**[0:44:44-0:45:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:44:44):**  work but take them to grass or sell them to go to grass or you know put them in your meat  program there's a hundred well maybe not a hundred but there's lots of good ways to do  that but but we tend to have blinders on do it the same way do it the same way and quite  
**[0:45:00-0:45:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:45:00):**  honestly that's why we're not getting the young people back here because they look at  it and go you know my friends from town don't do that they don't have to work that hard  and kill themselves i guess i won't come back and then here we are don't have any young  
**[0:45:15-0:45:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:45:15):**  people coming back and what do we do with agriculture i mean we hope it stays in family's  hands but that could be a problem yeah that's like we're kind of like dancing around this  whole succession planning can of worms again which yeah you know it it's a thing and maybe

**[0:45:57-0:46:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:45:57):**  tell that he was the anointed one you know it's the first the oldest son he's going to  come back take over the ranch that's the way it is and it's the way it was for me and and  he went to north Dakota state just like his dad did he came home and then uh Jay on the  
**[0:46:16-0:46:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:46:16):**  other hand he's the middle boy he went to Arizona state you know they at the time it  was supposedly the number one party school in the nation but he said he went strictly  for academics well put a pin in that we'll remember that number one party school we talk  
**[0:46:32-0:46:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:46:32):**  about Jay again in a few minutes and what he's doing now yeah exactly and i never dreamed  he would come back because he worked for he went to work for anheuser-busch had it made  in the corporate world you know he was in the fast lane never paid for anything at a  
**[0:46:47-0:47:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:46:47):**  corporate credit card very successful and one day called home and said you know i'm  tired of the corporate world i'm tired of the traffic the people i miss north Dakota  mr ranch i want to come home you know our joke was the heck are you smoking and and  
**[0:47:05-0:47:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:47:05):**  so i never dreamed he'd come back and and yet you know okay now how do we fit another  one in and then jace jace was the cowboy he went to Montana state on a rodeo scholarship  and and that was his dream to come back because that's he's the cowboy the family and so then  
**[0:47:24-0:47:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:47:24):**  all of a sudden boom we got three of them back here and i'm like wow how do we make  this all work you know and uh you can't put this all on the backs of the cows and and  then my daughter who went to the University of Wyoming you know she she really wanted  
**[0:47:39-0:47:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:47:39):**  to fit somehow and and she's not directly involved in the management or ownership but  she does help some and so then you're like holy smokes you know and now as they get married  then you bring in you know in-laws and outlaws and and how do they fit some you know some  
**[0:47:56-0:48:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:47:56):**  are rural and some aren't and some have uh you know they don't understand it quite the  same and and so we're going through this whole succession thing on this place and you know  i say it a million times i'm really excited to have all the kids back they have so much  
**[0:48:13-0:48:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:48:13):**  passion so much energy but yet you know let's face it they're at a little different stage  of life than i am their goals are a little bit different and even between jace the youngest  and the other two there's 10 years spread between him and them he's at a different stage  
**[0:48:31-0:48:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:48:31):**  of life and has different goals than the other two because he just barely got through the  screwing around phase now you know it means marrying that little boy and really coming  along but you know and so you you know we talked a lot in that succession school about  
**[0:48:46-0:49:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:48:46):**  family dynamics and it overwhelms me at times is trying to trying to pull this all together  and we have so many opportunities because everybody has some really good qualities that  can take us forward but you can in families a lot of times you can tear each other down  
**[0:49:07-0:49:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:49:07):**  in a heartbeat just because you can because your families and and we're working on that  and that's part of what that school is about and it's not simple but we're determined we're  not going to be one of those statistics that it didn't work and i i guess that's kind of  
**[0:49:24-0:49:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:49:24):**  a vulnerability part like none of us that are going through succession events have it  all figured out no like i don't think anybody ever has it figured out and there's always  something left to be done and i guess all we all we can do is really learn from those  
**[0:49:42-0:50:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:49:42):**  processes and try to pass that knowledge on right well it's probably the i would say this  the biggest challenge i've had you know you got a four-year degree in agriculture that  was never mentioned you know and yet it's probably one of the biggest challenges in  
**[0:50:02-0:50:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:50:02):**  agriculture right now i mean you go through holistic school and all that that never gets  talked about and yet we can have all the biological and the grazing and all that right and if  you don't get that family dynamic right the whole thing is going to fall apart and so  
**[0:50:17-0:50:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:50:17):**  but nobody wants to talk about first off it's not easy to talk about and we i just had this  conversation i was why i was late i was in a meeting in town we were talking about this  some of this partnering that's going on with the grazing coalition on this whole thing  
**[0:50:33-0:50:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:50:33):**  first off it's not easy to talk about oh someday i'm going to curl you know that when you think  about it and you go god i don't really like that and then you start talking about how  you're going to you know make sure this legacy continues on and and and everybody's got a  
**[0:50:51-0:51:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:50:51):**  little different picture of that and so how do you massage all that and i'm learning a  lot through the course of because we're working on this and we brought in professional folks  to help us because sometimes the mediator at the table keeps the conversation going  
**[0:51:07-0:51:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:51:07):**  right turns the negative into a positive it's been really helpful for us and i've learned  a lot even about myself you know and it don't come easy though you know there's times when  you you get a tear in your eye because there's some emotional stuff that gets brought out  
**[0:51:22-0:51:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:51:22):**  then you know there's just no easy way around it but we do agriculture is doing a terrible  disservice to itself by not facing this and i you know starring in bank i'm proud of what  their partnership they've seen this i've not seen that from most financial institutions  
**[0:51:43-0:52:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:51:43):**  to take that forward and say hey guys this is a real issue and and i threw that statistic  out there that day i'm not sure i can recall it but it's something like 70 of the land  in the united states is going to turn over within two decades that's a whole lot of land  
**[0:52:00-0:52:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:52:00):**  going to change hands here because a lot of us are getting older and what are we going  to do about it and if we don't get this right it's not going to be in family's hands it's  going to be in the investor hands i don't think that's what we want i don't think the  
**[0:52:14-0:52:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:52:14):**  consumer is going to want that either for agriculture it's not going to help the food  price oh well you say you don't think the consumer will want that and i i would probably  agree and disagree with that i would think the consumer doesn't know what they want i  
**[0:52:35-0:52:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:52:35):**  would say that the consumer wants to believe the line of bullshit they've been fed for  the spoon fed and well you're right and well that's part of our challenge and you know  this well brian we run agritourism operation here and why did we get into that trying to  
**[0:52:53-0:53:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:52:53):**  tell a positive story on agriculture in our little little way we get a lot of people here  and it's to tell them here's what we do we try to improve our natural or regenerate our  natural resources we try to put a really good wholesome product on your table it's not filled  
**[0:53:12-0:53:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:53:12):**  with whole lots of stuff that you don't know what it is and we can source verify it and  i'll put my name on it i'll stand behind it and we just haven't done that very well in  ag and you know and we we're doing our small little part and lots of people are but there's  
**[0:53:28-0:53:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:53:28):**  a big part of agriculture that's out there saying hey i'm smarter than you i'll do it  the way i want you're gonna like it you know and i don't think that's gonna sell i agree  i think we have to do a better job of meeting people where they are and where they are in  
**[0:53:47-0:54:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:53:47):**  their journey you know on regenerative ag or wherever they're in their own personal  health journey we've got to do a better job of meeting people where they're at and sharing  sharing maybe some relevant experiences what happened what we were doing when we were in  
**[0:54:03-0:54:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:54:03):**  their shoes yeah i i think on some level you know some some parts of our industry we need  to shine a light in some of the dark corners and some things that are going on in the industry  you know things not that you and i are a part of but you know just practices that are kind  
**[0:54:26-0:54:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:54:26):**  of commonly accepted right i think the i think the american customer deserves to have their  food grown by people like you and i that are willing to stand behind it that are willing  to put our name on it and say this is my story and i wanted to grow this healthy beautiful  
**[0:54:44-0:55:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:54:44):**  food to nourish your body and i stand behind that you don't and i don't think that any  of the big meat packers would do that i don't think any of their big feedlots would want  to do that i don't think any of the big you know feedlots would want you to go on around  
**[0:55:01-0:55:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:55:01):**  touring and asking questions like oh what's that big 15 acre pond down there at the bottom  of the hill what do you guys do with that stuff yeah and i'm thinking about a lot of  you know some of the laws that got passed in the last 20 years like the ag gag laws  
**[0:55:20-0:55:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:55:20):**  and the and the freedom to farm act you know the freedom to farm laws and the rights to  farm yeah they're sold as a good thing but what are they really protecting they're not  protecting guys like you or me they're protecting these huge corporate interests that want to  
**[0:55:36-0:55:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:55:36):**  be able to engage in these let's just say questionable practices that are you know questionable  rather from an animal health point of view or ecological point of view or an environmental  point of view they don't want these things to come to light and when when some do they'll  
**[0:55:56-0:56:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:55:56):**  just say well that's just how we have to do business or well we get that from another  supplier so that's somebody else's problem right you know like the feedlot operator is  not responsible for all the soil degradation and erosion because of the corn and the feed  
**[0:56:12-0:56:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:56:12):**  that had to be grown to feed the cows in the feedlot that's not his problem the farmer's  not responsible for it because he's just doing the best that he knows how and he didn't know  it was happening it's like at some point we got to quit passing this buck around and take  
**[0:56:26-0:56:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:56:26):**  responsibility for the food that we're growing and the manner in which we're growing it well  I agree and you know there well there's bad apples everywhere and I just I think the quicker  we just admit that and and come head on to the consumer because the consumer is very  
**[0:56:46-0:57:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:56:46):**  confused right now over a lot of stuff and I know this from the ones that come here and  they will they will tell me you know where I'm from they come from a big city or whatever  the perception of agriculture they say is terrible and yet they spend a few days here  
**[0:57:05-0:57:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:57:05):**  and they're like wow you know I've been told you guys you know you you ruin your the waterways  you poison the air you beat your animals you you don't care and and and what we see is  you live and breathe trying to regenerate these natural resources you care about that  
**[0:57:25-0:57:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:57:25):**  water you make sure your your cattle aren't standing out in the middle of that creek that  goes in the Missouri River every day you you know you're you you you're worried about all  this stuff and trying to do a good job and then then they challenge me you've got to  
**[0:57:40-0:57:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:57:40):**  tell the story because people aren't hearing it enough and so I always take that challenge  seriously in our own small way to to tell people hey you know we're trying really hard  we're not we're not farming right up next to the creek and making sure nitrates are  
**[0:57:58-0:58:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:57:58):**  flowing down into that creek I mean we we can clean this up without doing much different  it's just little things to to improve that image and you know and then the consumer will  be behind us we need them behind us because otherwise we're going to get in and this same  
**[0:58:15-0:58:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:58:15):**  guy that I'm telling the story on said otherwise you're going to get regulated out of business  you know we saw that with waters of the U.S. and that you know we could list a hundred  different things again if somebody's hit behind a desk doesn't really understand it here's  
**[0:58:32-0:58:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:58:32):**  these bad stories well here we'll do this they'll learn you know we'll fix it you know  so I think we all got to do a better job and that's why guys like you in a podcast hopefully  that's getting out to people and they they hear this stuff and they go wow there's some  
**[0:58:49-0:59:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:58:49):**  good things out there so I I commend you for what you do well thanks thanks I know I at  least have five listeners  yeah I mean  
**[0:59:06-0:59:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:59:06):**  getting the word out spread the word about what we do given tours it almost seems like  we're trying to drain the ocean with a red solo cup a little bit right you know I think  about that there's you know there's 330 million people living in this country the biggest  
**[0:59:32-0:59:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:59:32):**  podcast right now is Joe Rogan and he's probably getting between 11 and 12 million downloads  per episode I'm not even a fraction of a percent of that don't even want to talk about it but  he's only reaching three percent like there's just an incredible amount of people in the  
**[0:59:55-1:00:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=0:59:55):**  world you know it's just the incredible amount of people that don't understand it's it's  almost a generational problem it's almost like you have to go into the schools and start  teaching the children about what food is and where it comes from in order to really change  
**[1:00:16-1:00:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:00:16):**  the momentum well you're exactly right well even in North Dakota one of the most rural  states may be the most rural state in the nation and yet you can go in to Bismarck which  is only what 60 70 000 people and kids a lot of kids couldn't tell you you know well food  
**[1:00:36-1:00:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:00:36):**  comes from Walmart or wherever it is you know it's how quick we became removed from from  the farm and ranch and you kind of saw that happen in your younger days didn't you no  yeah exactly you know I mean a while back when I was in grade school or whatever there  
**[1:00:56-1:01:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:00:56):**  was a lot of the kids still rural kids you know or their at least their grandparents  were you know so they visited a farmer ranch on a regular occasion now that's not the case  and but you know and the challenge in that is is it's harder to get into schools they  
**[1:01:15-1:01:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:01:15):**  don't even want you know they used to like to have those kinds of things brought in so  kids could learn they're really touchy on that we used to I used to run the pro rodeo  in Mandan we used to go into the schools Bismarck Mandan before the rodeo and we'd bring the  
**[1:01:31-1:01:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:01:31):**  clown and we'd bring a bareback reagan and and a rope and different stuff and we'd show  what it was the spur really like and how are the animals treated and feel this feel the  the flame strap it's not hurting them and you know you'd have a lot of fun but you'd  
**[1:01:51-1:02:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:01:51):**  educate them on on how the animals are treated and the last year that I was doing that schools  now we can't allow outsiders to come in to talk about that even in a rural area like  Bismarck Mandan North Dakota I mean there were some of the smaller schools but the bigger  
**[1:02:10-1:02:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:02:10):**  schools wouldn't let you in anymore and I'm like gosh these kids they love this stuff  and they're yearning for and then we'd give free rodeo tickets to all the kids that came  in and stuff it was fun and the kids loved it and yet we don't want them to learn anything  
**[1:02:25-1:02:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:02:25):**  anymore we just you know unless it's something goofy I don't get it sounds like I have this  picture in my head of some new administrator somewhere in that system was like you know  a vegetarian or a vegan saw that you were doing that was like oh no we can't have this

**[1:03:01-1:03:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:03:01):**  kind of let that slip away on us yeah yeah and so how do we get back to where we're telling  a more regenerative side of the story versus versus what everybody thinks they know about  their food and about how how bad us big ranchers and farmers are for the land you're right  
**[1:03:26-1:03:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:03:26):**  that's a good question and I think when we tell that I think it sells like people get  excited they feel good about it it's this whole generation I think something good came  out of the pandemic in that there's a whole lot of young people that want to connect with  
**[1:03:43-1:03:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:03:43):**  where their food comes from and they want to be healthier we've learned that the American  people aren't very healthy a lot of you know and I'm not trying to be critical but got  a lot of obesity in the world and that didn't help us through a pandemic and there's a lot  
**[1:03:58-1:04:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:03:58):**  of folks that wanna if Brian Alexander's rings and beefs and they think you're doing a good  job they're willing to pay a little more they want to come out to your place they want to  see you and talk to you and feel your passion and that's a growing segment and we have got  
**[1:04:15-1:04:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:04:15):**  to go down that path and tell that story more if it's through a podcast if it's I just came  from this meeting in Bismarck with the Natural Resources Trust and we're talking about trying  to bring in some we did a we did some health people that are really knowledgeable on the  
**[1:04:35-1:04:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:04:35):**  benefits of grass-finished beef in a healthy diet and I had people come up to me and it  was for producers but I had people come up to me afterwards and say when you bring them  back and do it for consumers and my question in this meeting was how do we get the consumers  
**[1:04:52-1:05:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:04:52):**  there I'm all for doing it needs to be done I mean you know only in our little small way  but hopefully make a difference but how do we convince those consumers this is important  and we talked about if we did it on this ranch and we did it in our facility and we had this  
**[1:05:11-1:05:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:05:11):**  health discussion and maybe we even bust them out here from Bismarck we find sponsors and  we're able to do that and we we didn't once with grass-finished beef and a beer off our  brewery that sort of thing but then we take them out into the grassland and tell them  
**[1:05:29-1:05:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:05:29):**  the benefit of that grassland to our old ecosystem and most people love wildlife and all I think  we could really tie this together meaning it takes me to do that but I got to make sure  if we're going to do it somehow we get people there and that's the million dollar question  
**[1:05:47-1:06:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:05:47):**  so getting the consumer to come out for ranch tours and show them what the environment is  like and how we you know how guys like you and I interact with the land and the cattle  on a daily basis you know we're only going to ever get an incredibly small fraction of  
**[1:06:06-1:06:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:06:06):**  that in person on their ranch and you know this this podcast is growing there's other  great podcast out there that I could mention there's you know tons of good good guys doing  all kinds of great regenerative things all over social media you know Facebook Instagram  
**[1:06:29-1:06:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:06:29):**  TikTok on Twitter you know whatever your social media drug of choice is it's out there but  it just seems like it I'm not going to say it seems like an echo chamber because we are  reaching you know as a group I think we're reaching new people and and growing the audience  
**[1:06:47-1:07:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:06:47):**  but it still seems like it's such a small number versus the versus the 300 odd million  people I know well it's my frustration every day it's it's just like and you know this  when you drive down the road and you see vast pastures and there's no fences anywhere and  
**[1:07:09-1:07:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:07:09):**  you're like they're just squeezing along grazing yet and all that you've done and I've done  and lots of other people have done and all the programs it seems like people should embrace  it more but you know again part of it's we're we're victims of habit and so to break that  
**[1:07:31-1:07:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:07:31):**  tradition and to change is really a struggle for not only producers but consumers as well  and but it's one of our biggest challenges is how do we get this message out because  there's a there's a million groups out there trying to take the cow off the land and they  
**[1:07:49-1:08:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:07:49):**  think that will improve things and you well know if you if you remove the animals from  the land you will desertify the land we will eventually all go hungry and we'll shoot each  other over food I mean that's just what will happen that's savory that's savory's belief  
**[1:08:05-1:08:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:08:05):**  since day one and I many's right you it's it's the ruminant on the on the rangeland  that made the rangeland what it is and if some folks think all that you take them off  and all this wildlife will flourish that's not true and and I don't know they need to  
**[1:08:23-1:08:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:08:23):**  figure that out I guess but and we we try to show them every time we can but it's not  simple if it was simple and easy everybody'd be doing it Jerry I think that's why I think  that's why there's just a few of us so yeah so you got your three boys back you got Jeremy  
**[1:08:45-1:09:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:08:45):**  doing the hunting and the a lot of the what would you say it agro eco tourism yeah that  yeah that's kind of well when Jay came back we already had the we had the lodgers we've  had a grand lodge which was original after the sod house was kind of original around  
**[1:09:06-1:09:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:09:06):**  ranch house was actually a sears and robot kid house came into the ranch on the on the  railroad which is a little ghost town now it's britain north dakota it's where my grandfather  and grandmother met her I guess I wouldn't be here but so anyway they turned that into  
**[1:09:23-1:09:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:09:23):**  our grand lodge we have a liquor license and a commercial kitchen and and when Jay came  back we already had these lodges and the grand lodge and and he said I think we have an opportunity  to add agro tourism and have folks here talk about ranching have tours and then what grew  
**[1:09:44-1:10:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:09:44):**  out of that was western weddings it's become a fairly big deal and so you know where that  all goes but it's again we try to tell the positive story whenever we can and and then  of course then the brewery grew out of that we took a a barn and converted into a uh event  
**[1:10:09-1:10:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:10:09):**  center we can actually see 450 people in there and uh it's all rustic and really cool place  and then Jay who had worked for Amazon bush always had this dream to do a microbrew and  so so he put in this brewery and so we sell our own beer at all our our events and it's  
**[1:10:31-1:10:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:10:31):**  seen quite a few different uh establishments around the state then he came out with the  new bison beer which is in Fargo and the eight-time national champion ndsu bison that's a big  deal in Fargo and so uh so it's been interesting I mean there's a lot of work in brewing beer  
**[1:10:52-1:11:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:10:52):**  that I didn't know about I just drank the stuff didn't know anything about it and so  it takes a lot of time for Jay but I'm gonna try to get Jay on on pretty soon to talk about  the brewery but that because it just it sounds like a really neat operation you guys have  
**[1:11:07-1:11:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:11:07):**  going on there yeah well he he's got a passion for it he wants to prove he can do it you  know and it's a it's a low margin deal but but it's been interesting and and then and  then when jase came back uh you know he's the cowboy and so I'm helping him transition  
**[1:11:29-1:11:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:11:29):**  into the cattle and the buffalo and then then we got it we got our we have our own uh grass  finished label for both beef and bison and and him and his wife Cassie are growing that  and it's been interesting and and uh so I think there's a lot of opportunity in that  
**[1:11:49-1:12:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:11:49):**  but as you well know I mean it sounds so simple but it's a lot of work because it's hard to  hard to get dates in a plant and that sort of thing and then you're dealing again with  public and delivery and all those logistical things that we're learning and been a been  
**[1:12:10-1:12:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:12:10):**  a educational curve I think but again it gets us excited it's fun it adds excitement to  the whole ranching operation and and he's we've stacked these enterprises but they all  kind of complement the main the main ranch I you know I don't ever foresee that we won't  
**[1:12:30-1:12:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:12:30):**  have cattle you know buffalo or whatever here but if you're going to bring the next generation  back first off you can't stand in their way and I had to learn that it's not it's not  easy for a traditional guy like I was big chunk of my life to keep doing things the  
**[1:12:50-1:13:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:12:50):**  way you always did and not but if you expect the next generation to come back you better  give them some room to grow you can't do it all on cows or wheat or soybeans or whatever  letting them have some outside ideas creates excitement creates income and and you can  
**[1:13:09-1:13:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:13:09):**  have a lot of fun with it so I mean I'd love to have a brewery on my ranch I don't drink  so I don't know why it'd just be really cool to have one yeah one of the highlights from  the trip to North Dakota was was we went to lunch you me Jay forget it I can't remember  
**[1:13:31-1:13:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:13:31):**  rest of the folks that were there but the spot you took us to like the first thing I  noticed on the menu go all the way down to the burgers there's three black leg beef burgers  and two black leg bison burgers and then you start looking around and seeing black leg  
**[1:13:47-1:14:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:13:47):**  brewery everywhere and then here comes Jay and he's like hey these are the two beers  that we've got like oh cool so you got a place to take people in town that you can eat your  meat and your beer in town I think that is just I think that's super cool yeah it is  
**[1:14:08-1:14:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:14:08):**  cool I think and that that place has been super good to us and you know it's just kind  of fun and and that they've got both of them and you know and most of us in ag and ranching  you don't have time and you don't do the greatest job or promotion the one thing Jay's good  
**[1:14:27-1:14:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:14:27):**  at because he did it for Anheuser-Busch is that promotion end and and we need to let  him run with this a little bit and cross promote across the different things we do and and  if we do that and and not you know bicker over family issues it'll really be positive  
**[1:14:47-1:15:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:14:47):**  for the whole operation so so as Jay's takes over more and more of the cow and bison I'm  sorry Buffalo you pick yours oh it doesn't matter what I say somebody will probably write  and tell me I said it wrong yeah I know so as Jay's picks up more and more of that enterprise  
**[1:15:10-1:15:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:15:10):**  what's next for Jerry I mean that's like that's the one white expression plan convertible  red Corvette drag main street Bismarck like I did when I was 18 you know she laughs at  me you know that would last about two spins and then I'd go well that was cool now what  
**[1:15:29-1:15:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:15:29):**  do I do well you know I'm not I'm not one that uh I'm not a big golfer I got a lot of  passion for this regenerative ag I don't know if I can just not really look into retire  I'd like to slow down a little bit do a little more travel you know me I love speaking it's  
**[1:15:48-1:16:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:15:48):**  not like I want to go on to speak and tour and speak every week but when I can do a handful  of them and meet some people and share my passion for regenerative ag and bringing the  next generation back I love that part and so I'd like to continue to do that see if  
**[1:16:03-1:16:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:16:03):**  I can move the needle a bit on regenerative ag too you know I'm president of North Dakota  grazing lands coalition I love doing that I don't you know I'm I'm at that stage of  my life where I I don't need more jobs and I won't take many but something that really  
**[1:16:18-1:16:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:16:18):**  intrigues me like the grazing coalition because it's like-minded people like you and I that  had struggles and saw they had to do something different and then embrace this and are pretty  darn successful and so much happier and fun to be around you know it's just fun to be  
**[1:16:37-1:16:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:16:37):**  around them because they're problem solvers you know and so it's that mentality that impresses  me and I love being around those kind of people good stuff good stuff well is there uh is  there anything that you want to get off your chest that I forgot to ask you jerry that's  
**[1:16:58-1:17:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:16:58):**  a loaded question brian well and you know I'd encourage you to have jay or any of the  boys on to visit about that I think it's good for your listeners young people looking you  know I guess one thing I'd say because our operation is different in that we stack these  
**[1:17:18-1:17:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:17:18):**  enterprise enterprises I I'm convinced every place out there has an unfair advantage whatever  that is and you usually won't have any idea what it might be because you're too close  to it but I uh ours ended up being we've got an international airport 25 miles away and  
**[1:17:42-1:18:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:17:42):**  a lot of these guests fly in here I never thought anything about it but that's a big  deal to us if we were 100 miles away from that airport this might not work near as good  and I was on a panel with a Nebraska ranch and and they uh they had a river runs through  
**[1:18:03-1:18:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:18:03):**  the ranch and they started this uh they call it uh tanking I think it is and they put a  tank in the river drop it on one end pick it up at the other end and and they uh are  able to put these people in there and they they've gained quite an income stream off  
**[1:18:24-1:18:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:18:24):**  that thing and I'm just like you know you got to think out of the box a little bit and  then uh find ways to uh find what that unfair advantage is and go with it so I guess yeah  floating down the river tubing down the river that's that's a thing my river is not anywhere  
**[1:18:41-1:18:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:18:41):**  near deep enough to do that and I think I have a creek wide enough you could just about  jump over any day right yeah well you know it's just funny how some people but most people  that are on a ranch would never think of that and of course it you know it's you're opening  
**[1:18:56-1:19:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:18:56):**  up to people and you've got to do things a little different but if it generates an income  stream that allows the next generation to come back then maybe you should take a peek  you know so if somebody wants to pay to come out and sit out in the blind at five o'clock  
**[1:19:11-1:19:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:19:11):**  in the morning and look at lesser prairie chickens I'll probably let them do that yeah  exactly well I've really enjoyed being with you Brian so yep sorry we've got to cut it  a little bit short we're running a little bit late today and I have another thing to

**[1:22:06-1:22:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:22:06):**  I can do way better than I remember what it was like yeah exactly yeah I could solve solve  the world's problems so so yeah I'm getting the hell out of here so I you know well growing  up in North Dakota it's I and I'm biased I absolutely loved it I love growing up in the  
**[1:22:31-1:22:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:22:31):**  country my brother and I were extremely close and we explored I thought literally we own  half the state of North Dakota we could do whatever we want to go over go wherever we  wanted I think we own half of a hospital from all the bumps and bruises and scars and broken  
**[1:22:51-1:23:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:22:51):**  bones that's pretty pretty normal we were always getting into you know flipping a flipping  a four-wheeler or getting thrown off a horse and stepped on and and so I remember some  of that yeah but it's all part of it it made us who we are today hopefully that's a good  
**[1:23:09-1:23:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:23:09):**  thing but that was growing up in in North Dakota we we were always involved in something  we were in 4-h we were in speech and demonstration we built things we welded and I bless my parents  they probably went a little overboard on our involvement like I was in flower arranging  
**[1:23:34-1:23:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:23:34):**  in cross-stitch and yeah photography and I'm like mom come on like seriously I mean looking  back we were forced to do this but it was good I appreciate it on every level of just  how involved we were and how fortunate we were I guess so so that's that was growing  
**[1:23:59-1:24:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:23:59):**  up in North Dakota I mean we just we did a lot of things and it was a family a family  operation always a family event a community driven we've kind of lost sight of that a  little bit with the community side you know everybody's these days are it's unfortunate  
**[1:24:19-1:24:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:24:19):**  so we're trying to bring that back I guess here on the ranch if we can maybe beer will  help yeah we've already seen it I guess a little bit so that kind of brings people together  which is nice okay so that was growing up being the black sheep getting out of North  
**[1:24:40-1:25:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:24:40):**  Dakota went to Arizona State for college strictly for academic purposes I don't know if you  ever heard of Arizona State I have not but it doesn't surprise me that there's one down  there yeah yeah it's I hear it's a party school I never got involved obviously right I did  
**[1:25:01-1:25:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:25:01):**  a little bit it was fun I got accepted their business school which was pretty prestigious  I guess business school I didn't really didn't know what I was gonna do I was undeclared  it's never gonna come back and so I said all right what else what's out there work for  
**[1:25:19-1:25:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:25:19):**  after college I actually became a financial planner financial advisor got securities licensed  so I got to figure out how money worked right out of college which was fun but wearing a  suit so first of all living in Phoenix or Scottsdale Tempe I drove a stick shift truck  
**[1:25:41-1:26:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:25:41):**  and no wonder people are fed up driving in three hour long you know transit stuck in  traffic but for me I was constantly just just clutching the whole time and I'm like oh how  much more can I do this it was miserable so so that was no fun and then wearing a suit  
**[1:26:04-1:26:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:26:04):**  and tie in 118 degree weather just it was awful it was awful yeah yeah so I got in the  beer industry so after that I worked for Senator John McCain's family there in Phoenix and  they owned one of the largest beer distributorships in the in the country okay and that that was  
**[1:26:28-1:26:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:26:28):**  a lot of fun a lot of fun I absolutely loved the company they did a tremendous job worked  my way up relatively fast in that company and and I appreciate those guys so much and  I didn't want to leave I got to work directly with Andy or Andrew McCain which was John  
**[1:26:45-1:27:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:26:45):**  Sun who was our CFO at the time and now he's the CEO or president from my understanding  and then Anheuser-Busch recruited me relocated me to Austin Texas and so so that was cool  I mean that was literally the beer business and working for a Fortune 100 company kind  
**[1:27:05-1:27:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:27:05):**  of broadened my horizons.  And you're all on the numbers financial side right?  Not necessarily I don't really I don't see myself as a numbers guy I think I see myself  
**[1:27:22-1:27:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:27:22):**  as a brand development marketing guy that is what we have uncovered as we go through  kind of some strategic planning from a ranching family base looking at it as a business and  our strengths and so that's kind of my my forte I guess.  
**[1:27:45-1:28:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:27:45):**  Okay so Anheuser-Busch recruited you moved you down to Texas what was that like?  I mean you probably haven't enjoyed you know some some decently cold weather like they  have every once in a while in North Dakota in a while have you?  
**[1:28:01-1:28:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:28:01):**  You know I had no intention to go into Austin at all or Texas and it was Austin which is  not even Texas what I've experienced yeah and I've been all over in Texas now and yeah  Austin is I mean it's keep Austin weird that's a slow one.  
**[1:28:17-1:28:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:28:17):**  I mean I'm foodie wise I love going Austin to eat yeah.  The food the culture yeah yeah it is it is and now it's like since all these goofballs  are coming from California I can say that right?  
**[1:28:34-1:28:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:28:34):**  Yeah they're Californians listening right now.  I'm a Californian so you're right.  So you want well I'm glad you're listening we got one Californian.  
**[1:28:45-1:28:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:28:45):**  We know it we'll own it.  There's a couple out there I think that listen.  I was this close to moving to California and I'm so glad I pivoted I got offered a job  
**[1:28:55-1:29:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:28:55):**  I was working so we all grew up U.S. smokeless tobacco so we went literally I went from one  vice Copenhagen and skull all through college rodeos, nascar, spring breaks it was unbelievable  it was fun and then I got offered right after college full-time job with them in Yorba Linda  
**[1:29:16-1:29:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:29:16):**  California.  I like Yorba Linda though Yorba Linda is cool and because it's Orange County it's not so  bad.  
**[1:29:24-1:29:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:29:24):**  Okay yeah it's a little more conservative anyways but there's too many people yeah.  Sorry no there's too many people in Austin there's too many people in Phoenix I mean  people are just you know multiplying like like bunnies I mean it's just it's crazy.  
**[1:29:43-1:29:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:29:43):**  I'd argue there's just too many people in in town period but that's yeah wow we got  more cattle in North Dakota than we do we do people and we're fine with that that's  I like that statistic.  
**[1:29:56-1:30:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:29:56):**  Excuse me so Austin was cool I mean I so a buddy of mine worked for the company and and  I said I don't want to leave the company I'm with he said we'll fly out you can interview  literally my interview was at like the Hyatt or Hilton one of the two over breakfast after  
**[1:30:22-1:30:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:30:22):**  two straight days of they rented boats double decker boats we we hit a I mean it was just  it was a live music fun time over a weekend and so I flew out on like a Friday flew back  on a Sunday afternoon and interviewed one hour before my flight over breakfast after  
**[1:30:44-1:31:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:30:44):**  having a hell of a good time and I was I literally was sold and I think there was some strategy  there because when they took me out in Austin I was I was blown away at how fun it was and  honestly how accepting I had this image in my head that I wasn't gonna like Texas one  
**[1:31:04-1:31:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:31:04):**  of my exes I had an ex from Texas and I guess there's they wrote a song about it yeah after  the fact yeah yeah no I I just didn't want to go to Texas and and found out I actually  really enjoyed Texas so so it's cool okay so then what ah well working for an eyes are  
**[1:31:25-1:31:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:31:25):**  Bush was amazing that it was the good old boy company the bushes still ran it so they  invested back into their employees and and that was that was fun and you felt you felt  good about it he's in the town sorry mama bear just walked in it's okay what were you  
**[1:31:58-1:32:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:31:58):**  asking so you're an eyes are Bush they're investing back in your education like I'm  trying to get to the point where you learn how to brew beer yeah okay well and I was  a bush yeah I was never gonna build a brewery I was never on my radar at all I was brand  
**[1:32:17-1:32:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:32:17):**  development guy like in marketing that's what I enjoyed sales and and and I was a bush I  had heard rumblings of a hostile takeover publicly traded company right the bushes lost  control it is what it is shareholders accepted a dollar amount from in bev which is a Belgian  
**[1:32:42-1:33:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:32:42):**  company and yeah so imbed bottom out and I resigned prior to that because what I had  heard I did not like and I'm glad I did the whole dynamic of that company changed and  honestly I missed the Midwest I missed where I grew up and the ranch and so my older brother  
**[1:33:04-1:33:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:33:04):**  and I had been talking quite a bit he had started the hunting outfit diversified the  ranch and and so I came back 2008 it's really helped grow that side of it bring in guests  and and look ahead at more from profitability standpoint that kind of when when we started  
**[1:33:27-1:33:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:33:27):**  growing things because we could we had funds now and it was it wasn't overnight that that  happened it took a long time and so I commend my brother and thinking outside the fence  little bit and everybody's got an unfair advantage somewhere so for us a we're close we're 20  
**[1:33:49-1:34:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:33:49):**  minutes from an airport the Bismarck Airport we're you know we got a big land base and  so what was on that already well you got wildlife and so initially back in 2000 when he started  it was all right you pay a hundred dollars and we point you over in that pasture field  
**[1:34:07-1:34:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:34:07):**  or whatever and then they go hunt and that's it you didn't offer any other amenities and  so over the years you take these old bunk houses old ranch houses convert them and and  so they were sitting dormant over the summer over the summer months and so when I came  
**[1:34:26-1:34:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:34:26):**  back I mean we were we were doing everything I mean we were scrubbing toilets we were guiding  we were cooking we were I mean we weren't afraid to to do any of the work because we  had to we had to hustle because we didn't have you know large amounts of money coming  
**[1:34:42-1:35:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:34:42):**  in and we were pumping everything back in to the business and that's what I try to kind  of you know the younger generation and I'm going to say that like I'm so god dang old  I turned 40 this month by the way in t minus 12 days I'm not looking forward to that but  
**[1:35:03-1:35:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:35:03):**  30 was hard for me I think 40 is just probably another number but that's kind of what it  felt like for me it was just another number yeah yeah I've got 44 coming up this year  ah nice and the Californian we're probably sure you're way younger than that so we don't  
**[1:35:22-1:35:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:35:22):**  have to go there I just know you're way younger than that I'm in my 30s so we're good okay  all right so I just what I was getting at is the younger generation they you know with  all the social media and the influencers out there and you know the youtubers that are  
**[1:35:41-1:35:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:35:41):**  making you know hand over fist millions of dollars immediately oh you come out with this  really you know cool video or whatever it is and all of a sudden overnight boom you  got views you got money rolling in or whatever it is and I just hope I mean we need you know  
**[1:35:56-1:36:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:35:56):**  people in the trade we need people that actually like manual labor and I get it these influencers  I'm sure it's a lot of work and editing and all that whatever it is it's not building  fence yeah exactly and you're not going to make a million dollars building fence and  
**[1:36:13-1:36:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:36:13):**  so that's probably why they're like uh-uh we're not gonna do this we're gonna make some  funny videos the jackasses of the world you know they're probably the first ones to be  like yeah let's start throwing out some you know ridiculous videos and start getting hits  
**[1:36:27-1:36:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:36:27):**  and then a network picks you up and and whatever I mean that's well I saw that's what happened  with Anheuser-Busch right like the family didn't they have a show did they have a show  they got a show yeah and I watched it so yes I'm what I didn't know that well I don't know  
**[1:36:47-1:37:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:36:47):**  if I would have was it good I thought it was super scripted but I thought it was interesting  people with what's that like oh god yeah and I don't know if people get bored with their  life if they're like yeah just follow me around with a with a camera because we got some notoriety  
**[1:37:05-1:37:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:37:05):**  and we think we deserve it and I don't know whatever if people want to watch that yeah  I mean was it good it was good I mean I watched the whole season so yeah nice I don't know  if there's a second season so I guess I didn't really retain for them sure sure yeah well  
**[1:37:25-1:37:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:37:25):**  and I hope the younger generation they they have some realistic goals instead of just  you know trying to get likes or hits or views or whatever it is and so and I don't ever  there's no overnight successes right I don't think you should have a backup plan because  
**[1:37:45-1:38:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:37:45):**  you're ultimately setting yourself up to fail I mean go after what you believe in and I  don't think social media influencer is a very sustainable business model probably not probably  not yeah there's a lot that goes into that that's a lot of pressure you know to to keep  
**[1:38:07-1:38:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:38:07):**  that engagement and content you know rolling I guess but so we got in so I guess 2008 when  I came back you know we we started remodeling the old Sears and Roebuck house which is my  great great grandparents house built in early 1900s cost $2,300 back in the day and took  
**[1:38:30-1:38:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:38:30):**  us two and a half years and so we we did everything ourselves I mean it was a lot of a lot of  work so trying to navigate through a business running a business while remodeling it's just  it was a lot took a toll and we kept going I don't think we've ever looked back I guess  
**[1:38:52-1:39:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:38:52):**  and so there's there's always a construction project going on especially in the winter  we pick up a couple over the summer my brother's tearing out a an old house now and remodeling  it to use for for guests hunters and but the ones at the headquarters are old bunk houses  
**[1:39:16-1:39:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:39:16):**  converted and they were sitting vacant over the summer and so we had to say all right  let's let's start filling these beds what can we do so we got in the international game  or the international market I should say it's kind of a five-year process to get into international  
**[1:39:39-1:39:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:39:39):**  guests and we've we've hosted all 50 states and 40 foreign countries to the ranch but  it's not easy you got to do a lot of freebies up front so you invite these and you work  with your department of commerce and tourism so you get these operators that come from

**[1:40:15-1:40:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:40:15):**  it so we we've done a ton of those back in 2010 and 2014 I guess and and every one of  them they're like yeah we can sell this we're gonna take it back to our country we can sell  you know your package the problem with us or North Dakota is that we are the only all-inclusive  
**[1:40:35-1:40:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:40:35):**  guest ranch in North Dakota and that's not a good thing I wish there was two it'd be  nice if there was ten yeah we're a flyover state it's unfortunate you know we're usually  the 50th state that's being you know visited and a lot of times when people are like all  
**[1:40:53-1:41:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:40:53):**  right I'm ready to go to the Dakotas which one do you think they're going to go to first  the one that has the faces on the side of that hill right freaking South Dakota come  on that's all right we we're fine with it we've accepted it well it's cold there like  
**[1:41:10-1:41:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:41:10):**  nine months out of the year the air hurts my face easy yeah it is it it gets snow in  June you know middle of June or July it's so unpredictable but it can get 100 degrees  you know in the middle of summer so no I just think utilizing your assets diversifying you  
**[1:41:32-1:41:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:41:32):**  know whatever you have right now if and everybody's like I said everybody's got an unfair advantage  somewhere you just got to identify that and so now that we have these lodges sitting vacant  now we're starting to fill them with traveling guests guests that want to you know pay to  
**[1:41:47-1:42:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:41:47):**  play cowboy you know we're not a dude ranch by any means right we could care we're not  going to cater to you we're not going to serve you afternoon tea after playing tennis or  whatever it is I mean you're going to fit into our schedule and and it's a lot of babysitting  
**[1:42:03-1:42:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:42:03):**  don't get me wrong yeah you know and our horses are working horses they're either old rodeo  horses or ranch you know horses and so no not any green horn can just jump on them and  so that was that's challenging at times because a lot of people are like yeah I've been on  
**[1:42:22-1:42:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:42:22):**  a horse once at a circus or you know a trail ride or whatever you're heading one in person  before yeah oh yeah that's true I've patted a horse or I saw one on a book once anyhow  yeah it's that's challenging and so we we've we've pivoted now COVID played a factor in  
**[1:42:43-1:43:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:42:43):**  that liability is another factor headache you know do we want to keep doing it so we've  that probably shut down all the international business that yeah that too yeah so we've  kind of suspended that side of the operation for the foreseeable future as of right now  
**[1:43:02-1:43:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:43:02):**  just the international tours even domestic even domestic horseback riding in general  we've we've pivoted away from that I mean once you once you stop you know kind of kind  of the trail horses the horses that you know you can you got to work with them all the  
**[1:43:23-1:43:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:43:23):**  time and if you don't got people on them well then they start getting green and then it's  just I mean maybe it was godsend you know and we're like all right let's pump the brakes  here and focus on something else maybe something a little bit more fun I don't know yeah yeah  
**[1:43:37-1:43:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:43:37):**  my my friends the hoys they had a I mean they called theirs the dude ranch over in the flint  hills called the flint and debbie yeah you know very similar they they kind of had a  position where they need to make extra income on the assets on the base that they had they  
**[1:43:53-1:44:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:43:53):**  convert a bunch of them to gas cabins and they did the dude ranch lifestyle thing for  I don't I think it was probably 15 years and they were thinking about giving it up when  covid hit and when covid hit it was just the exit no it's for them they said it was just  
**[1:44:12-1:44:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:44:12):**  a really really easy exit to plan at that point well and sometimes you I mean yeah you  can look at it financial being like yeah you make an x amount of additional supplement  supplementary income or you can just say you know what it's not worth the headache and  
**[1:44:29-1:44:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:44:29):**  you just need that little extra push you know and so I don't know we're thinking about some  things just because we we have the built up amenities so it's easy to to get into anything  guest related if we wanted to now we still are I mean don't get me wrong over the summer  
**[1:44:49-1:45:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:44:49):**  I mean we're booked out every weekend for weddings corporate events it's yeah it's building  the copper jewel barn I mean that's kind of our our centerpiece our crown jewel I guess  on the ranch now that guests can appreciate and come to enjoy and that's where the brewery  
**[1:45:11-1:45:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:45:11):**  is tell us about this big barn what's the history of this big barn yeah it's 13 000  square feet like it's it's so the original barn was built in the 50s by my great grandfather  and he built it out of cottonwood which is horrible wood for every purpose let's face  
**[1:45:30-1:45:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:45:30):**  you know let's let's not kid ourselves we're in north Dakota there's not a lot of wood  to begin with and so you got to kind of use with you know what assets you have right material  I guess and so so yeah that well if we want to all right so 2012 we got into corporate  
**[1:45:51-1:46:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:45:51):**  events 2013 was our first wedding we did and it was mine like I got married in 2013 and  and I didn't want it so this was more of a traditional thing before we opened the doors  to weddings I said it had to be a dome and just so happened I was engaged and so I'm  
**[1:46:13-1:46:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:46:13):**  like all right it's gonna be my wedding then first and then yeah floodgates can open and  they did but for the first two years we put up a tent white panel 40 by 80 white panel  tent and that sucked so bad just logistics if you can put up a tent and first of all  
**[1:46:33-1:46:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:46:33):**  it's when you're in shit North Dakota a lot of times it's pretty windy down here too I'm  trying to imagine that today in 35 mile an hour wind yeah right well and that's just  it so you got to erect the tent build a dance floor if we're doing weddings bring in the  
**[1:46:49-1:47:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:46:49):**  tables and chairs on a skid steer ripping up the yard or the grass hanging the lights  running the electrical building we're bringing in the bar and then you can do that for two  weeks back to back but then you got to tear it down otherwise you kill the grass and so  
**[1:47:06-1:47:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:47:06):**  right it needs sunlight to grow and so you're like oh this is miserable then you're storing  it somewhere that's probably dusty and then you got to clean everything off so I did that  for two years and I said no freaking way am I doing this again and so this Quonset this  
**[1:47:24-1:47:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:47:24):**  Quonset was sitting full corn and we didn't and it smacked out in the middle of our operation  hindsight I probably shouldn't have done it but again using what assets we had you know  it was a kind of a minimal barrier to entry then getting into that and so we cleared it  
**[1:47:46-1:48:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:47:46):**  out of corn my dad actually didn't want me to have it we fought on this a little bit  you know we talked to you about it at all but he's like you're not having it he didn't  mention that okay well it happened not physically but verbally he's like you're not touching  
**[1:48:04-1:48:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:48:04):**  it that's that's that's full of corn I said and we don't feed our cattle corn anymore  so why do we have it we're feeding rats and I'm not talking about these cute little tiny  little baby right like they were freaking monsters these rats were coming up underneath  
**[1:48:21-1:48:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:48:21):**  the concrete and just corn galore like just a food utopia and so I said all right so no  more corn I don't want to feed rats two he's like wow we use it for storage I said the  old busted down corn grinder that we got in there that we don't grind corn anymore that  
**[1:48:44-1:49:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:48:44):**  we don't need and so he's like oh we didn't have anything he's like you're still not taking  it I said all right so I took it upon myself to climb up and start ripping three layers  of shingles off that had been placed over and over you know just over the years just  
**[1:49:01-1:49:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:49:01):**  overlapping and and then it started to rain I said well we got to get this corn out of  here it's going to start you know rotten he's like all right you can have it and I imagine  he was a little upset that you tore the roof apart yeah well I needed to take drastic measures  
**[1:49:17-1:49:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:49:17):**  at that point because I needed a barn I did not want to put up that tent anymore and so  now it is I mean we've we started with this what was it 32 by 136 footprint very long  not that wide of a Quonset barn and I was I was fine with it I think the first wedding  
**[1:49:43-1:50:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:49:43):**  we had in there was the end of 2014 and the bride like tripped on one of the broken pieces  of concrete and stubbed her toe and it was bleeding and I'm like what am I doing but  I was so glad not to put up the tent yeah right and we had old shop lights in there  
**[1:50:01-1:50:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:50:01):**  I mean it was just it was very rustic and and primitive I mean makeshift bar and whatever  so but it was fun that following spring well kind of end of the winter I pressure washed  every square inch of and there was an accumulation of corn dust inch thick all the way around  
**[1:50:23-1:50:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:50:23):**  this thing it was pretty gross got rid of all the rats and I was going to put this little  bump out a ten thousand dollar little bump out on the far west end of this Quonset so  after you go a hundred and thirty six foot long you would have went another 20 foot maybe  
**[1:50:43-1:51:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:50:43):**  long for bathrooms and I'm like man that so I give my dad credit he's like this thing  is too long already he's like why don't you tee it off so you take a building now that's  this long and you tee that thing off from an aerial view I said all right I might be  
**[1:51:01-1:51:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:51:01):**  able to do this so we opened it up 40 foot wide with an engineered beam and teed it off  and it was only supposed to be like a 20 by 20 or 40 by 40 that's what we started with  then it went like 60 40 by 60 and now it's it's 84 by 104 and I ran out of room I wish  
**[1:51:22-1:51:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:51:22):**  I would have built bigger like it's just one well this thing wasn't even a thought and  so I obviously I took up some room you know for the brewery but I think everybody says  that about two years after they build a shop I wish I would have built it bigger I know  
**[1:51:39-1:52:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:51:39):**  I know yeah that's that's pretty typical like how big of a shop should I build the biggest  one you can afford yeah that's just it well yeah getting into the so let me let me see  here the barn so we teed it off it is six inch like reinforced rebar throughout because  
**[1:52:03-1:52:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:52:03):**  I said if these events do not work out we are driving like semis through here so I want  it to be able to hold the weight just in case and we still I mean we use this thing for  agricultural use I mean quite a bit but it's been great I mean it's a great asset to have  
**[1:52:24-1:52:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:52:24):**  now and we're we use it as a living classroom outdoors soil health biology indoors classrooms  different conferences or seminars or you name it I mean we've kind of done it all and now  the brewery I mean the brewery came out in 2018 is when we built that and and so I come  
**[1:52:49-1:53:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:52:49):**  from the beer background and every brewer I talk to they're like whatever your budget  is your end budget triple it and I'm like there's no way first of all we're pretty you  know hands-on like we're ranchers we can we know how to how to build things and right  
**[1:53:08-1:53:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:53:08):**  you know make things work no freaking way I had to triple my god dang budget and you  want to talk about a money pit this thing is an absolute money pit and it's still going  stripes we're we're looking at getting into packaging now and a whole canning line and  
**[1:53:26-1:53:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:53:26):**  it just it never ends but it's great we get to make beer and that's fun breaks up the  monotony and the redundancy of you know sitting in a tractor you know we're chasing cattle  and I mean chasing cattle always go smooth right they never get out they always listen  
**[1:53:46-1:54:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:53:46):**  to you when you say hey we need you to go into that next pasture there's green or grass  over there if you would just look ahead they always listen to us all we got to do is say  one word and they're there right yeah no hey walk over that hill and go through that gate  
**[1:54:00-1:54:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:54:00):**  I opened earlier you kind of touched that you spent a lot of time like in the beer business  but you didn't do any brewing and you had the brewery in 2018 so did you like did you  try to brew your own beer first like on a small setup or did you just say we're doing  
**[1:54:15-1:54:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:54:15):**  this yeah I went straight commercial most crap breweries they start out you know home  brewing like you said small scale gallon batches or three gallon or five gallon or whatever  it is no I when I got serious about learning the chemistry a I read a lot of books I shadowed  
**[1:54:38-1:54:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:54:38):**  quite a bit I toured breweries I still had a lot of connections in the brewing community  even with an iser bush carbok and houston four peaks in arizona I mean it was it was  tremendous to have those resources available to me and honestly I felt like I was a sponge  
**[1:54:59-1:55:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:54:59):**  then kind of just grabbing pieces here and there if I could rather than being a homebrewer  and my blinders on saying all right this is how I started this on brewing and then you  start scaling up in your system and then you're still blinders I think and you can't really  
**[1:55:20-1:55:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:55:20):**  do that sometimes you gotta just be open I don't know and so any now the brewing community  is a pretty tight knit community there they are willing to lend a hand and you know just  share advice wherever they can so I I'm really appreciative of that because I like to drink  
**[1:55:44-1:56:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:55:44):**  it I didn't necessarily like to I mean I didn't know what the hell I was doing to be to start  out with but but we wanted a quality product and and hopefully we have that now with four  years under our belt or three and a half you know I I was sitting here thinking about the  
**[1:56:07-1:56:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:56:07):**  food police rules about you know just getting beef to the plate I can't even imagine some  of the hoops you have to jump through with like alcoholic beverage control like you definitely  don't have to go into that I was just kind of wanted to kind of learn I just wanted to  
**[1:56:24-1:56:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:56:24):**  make that observation that you know it's probably not an easy thing to do or or an easy bureaucratic  process to work through oh it's not that enjoyable in any quick Google search you know whether  the feds and TTB and all that okay so isn't there like a note you have to like pay for  
**[1:56:47-1:57:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:56:47):**  before you even get your license like you have to pay like a bond it's like 50 60 grand  or something is that right it's not that it depends on the size brewery yeah and maybe  it's better for beer versus liquor or it's true though I mean there's yeah how do you  
**[1:57:09-1:57:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:57:09):**  know that I watch the moonshiner show I'm like convinced if this world goes to hell  it's just getting pretty dang close I'm gonna be a moonshiner so good for you right I probably  will be good at it but we'll try not with that attitude you gotta be positive about  
**[1:57:30-1:57:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:57:30):**  it yeah but you do you there's a lot of buy-in before you can start production right like  you have a huge binder for full of everything you had to do before you can get started selling  it's insane layouts and I mean approvals and permits and yeah there's there's a lot that  
**[1:57:54-1:58:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:57:54):**  you got to do probably more than than I thought I was going to do more than I wanted to do  but you got to do it and yeah and so once once I had my mind set I mean I wasn't going  back I mean it's one of those things like you're fully vested now which good or bad

**[1:58:29-1:58:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:58:29):**  the products that we come out with there's definitely some traction on branding and brand  identity and and partnerships that that we're really excited about so but still I mean this  is smack dab in the middle of our operation so it can't nobody can just come in and be  
**[1:58:47-1:59:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:58:47):**  like yeah I want to buy this and we're going to operate right here no they'd have to buy  it and then get the hell out of here I see I see so what are some of the things your  dad leaves out when he tells the stories of the ranch you know so my dad's a good story  
**[1:59:09-1:59:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:59:09):**  teller he he's probably one of the best I mean it's fun to listen to him my uncle so  my dad's only sibling was just up here just a few days ago and I think he lives down in  Kansas now but and so we don't get to see him a lot but it's fun listening because he's  
**[1:59:36-2:00:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=1:59:36):**  10 years older than my dad and listening to his a either perspective of the ranch 100%  different than my dad's perspective and how each one of them was raised differently and  I mean not that my dad's doesn't talk about those things it's just a different time period  
**[2:00:01-2:00:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=2:00:01):**  it's probably not as relevant than what we're currently going through but I don't ever want  to forget where we came from and one of the the one of the most important and this happens  not just to our family but a lot of families is that you don't document the past or the  
**[2:00:19-2:00:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=2:00:19):**  history I was not that involved or interested in history when my grandfather died and that  was probably the biggest tragedy on this ranch has ever had because a lot of history and  tradition died with him and that was just I mean it suddenly so I and I know I'm getting  
**[2:00:44-2:01:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=2:00:44):**  off topic here I just oh that's fine I can't stress that enough and people talk about it  oh yeah we got to write this down we go and then they procrastinate and then it's too  late and all when it's too late you'll never get that back and that's we will never get  
**[2:01:01-2:01:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=2:01:01):**  back the knowledge and the information that my grandpa had of this ranch period so that's  sad you know I would agree with that and I was thinking about you know a lot of the lost  history that you know I've lost we've lost in this in my area some of the folks that  
**[2:01:24-2:01:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=2:01:24):**  have passed in the last two or three years and I think about my dad and I know for at  least 20 years he kept a day book like not a full journal just he'd go in and he'd write  down some events of the day you know things that happened if we got rain maybe an observation  
**[2:01:45-2:02:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=2:01:45):**  he had about the ranch or or the cows or the forage that were on it at the time I've literally  never looked at any of them and someday when he passes like I'm gonna have a lot of that  record and be able to go through it and the point I'm trying to make I think you have  
**[2:02:03-2:02:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=2:02:03):**  a I think you hit on something like what are we leaving behind for others to remember us  by is there what stories are there that we're gonna lose if they're not told and if they're  not written down and I think it's important to commit some of those to pen and paper.  
**[2:02:23-2:02:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=2:02:23):**  Well so one thing a I give my younger brother who was born in the wrong century mind you  you should have been born in the 1800s he is very traditional and my dad so I give both  of them credit for going around all the neighboring well probably not all of them but a lot of  
**[2:02:43-2:03:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=2:02:43):**  them neighboring farmers and ranchers in our area and they have documented just the past  and nobody cares about that stuff and now I mean they've done this over the last 10  years or so some of these guys are no longer with us so for them to gain this knowledge  
**[2:03:01-2:03:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=2:03:01):**  and document it like I'm I'm grateful for like I mean who who's done it in the past  Christ I'm 13th generation in this country we came over in 1629 from England wow the  Doan family and we were a bunch of outlaws I mean if you ever get a chance go to blacklegranch.com  
**[2:03:24-2:03:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=2:03:24):**  like it there's a 17 page story of my family in the 1700s we were a bunch of loyalists  which was not that uncommon so we were spies for the British there was a band of brothers  all Doan's which is my last name so I think five brothers and a cousin and they called  
**[2:03:43-2:04:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=2:03:43):**  them they called them the Robin Hoods of their day which I this does not make sense to me  because they would steal from the rich but very seldomly give back to the poor so I don't  know how they made that connection at all it doesn't make sense but the poor is that  
**[2:04:00-2:04:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=2:04:00):**  what it was yeah right yeah so I but it's pretty interesting so obviously didn't work  out too well for us back then and George Washington lost one of his battles because of a Doan  and and so there's really some really cool history but yes British lost good I guess  
**[2:04:20-2:04:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=2:04:20):**  but not good for my family most of most of them were well caught or shot or hung and  from my understanding two escaped thankfully otherwise I wouldn't be here fled to Canada  and then after you know things kind of were forgotten from my understanding is when my  
**[2:04:44-2:05:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=2:04:44):**  great great grandfather came down out of Canada that's usually where your dad starts is well  that great great grandfather came down out of Canada and he leaves out that whole first  couple hundred years it's interesting to hear that I know yeah well and that's I mean that  
**[2:05:01-2:05:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=2:05:01):**  that's still our history yeah I get it like it's it's hard to fathom and just to wrap  your head around you know the 1600s for god's sakes I mean or the 1700s for that matter  I mean there's just that is it so what I was getting at is there is a book this thick on  
**[2:05:19-2:05:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=2:05:19):**  the Doan family somebody wrote that down somebody documented that and so we're so grateful for  our forefathers or whoever to document that kind of thing because I mean if it wasn't  for that who the hell I mean where the hell did we come from I have no idea I mean it's  
**[2:05:39-2:05:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=2:05:39):**  so it's just amazing that we have that I wish I knew more about some of my ancestors than  I did like I really don't have that clear of an idea yeah of when most of my people  came to this part came to this continent I don't I don't wish I did and it's I would  
**[2:05:59-2:06:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=2:05:59):**  not we should hire someone Brian to like trace our genealogy I think they have people for  that yeah I don't want to give him my DNA though well I don't think you have you can  just give him the history you know it doesn't have to be DNA I know they do that on like  
**[2:06:17-2:06:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=2:06:17):**  ancestry.com or something yeah that's like spitting in a cup right like I have no idea  I've never done it yeah ours is known so that's that's all that is nice that is really nice  and that's pretty cool yeah it's pretty badass actually you guys are like the real wild west  
**[2:06:36-2:06:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=2:06:36):**  hopefully things have changed and we've mellowed out a bit but I mean I don't know if we have  or not I guess still some wild things that go on around this area.  Let's talk a little bit about some of the less wild things maybe some agritourism stuff  
**[2:06:54-2:07:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=2:06:54):**  that you have going on on the ranch what kind of things are you showing off and like what  so that what's this tour I guess what I'm asking is like are these half-day workshops  you know one two-day tours like what what are we what are we talking about I mean there's  
**[2:07:11-2:07:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=2:07:11):**  a lot of stuff and if I repeat myself I catch me because I was literally just interviewed  an hour ago for some publication and so a lot of these a lot of this stuff kind of kind  of does get repeated so please stop me.  
**[2:07:31-2:07:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=2:07:31):**  We do I mean we're a living classroom I guess is how we how we showcase the ranch I mean  we're pretty transparent we bring in a lot of different groups on all walks of life I  think one thing that that sets us apart from a lot of other traditional operations is that  
**[2:07:48-2:08:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=2:07:48):**  we will have a conversation with anyone I don't care who you are I don't care what side  of the aisle you're on I don't care if you're a freaking vegan or whatever it doesn't matter  to me I don't I don't care I want to learn I just associated myself with you know like-minded  
**[2:08:07-2:08:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=2:08:07):**  people I will never better myself yeah I might get along with you what's that?  That's called an echo chamber.  Yeah right that's exactly right and you get your little pep rally going and everybody  
**[2:08:19-2:08:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=2:08:19):**  just feels good at the end of it hell no if this country in this world all the problems  were solved all day long yeah sit in your sit in the room and sing kumbaya whatever  there's a lot of problems going on and so yes we need to have challenging conversations  
**[2:08:40-2:09:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=2:08:40):**  and challenge each other even my own family I mean it's one of those things you have to  challenge each other and it's not always easy and so what I'm getting at is we bring in  all sorts of groups we work with conservation groups and I will throw I won't say their  
**[2:09:03-2:09:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=2:09:03):**  names but there is a farm organization rather large I don't want to put this so someone  who heads up a farm organization I was involved in a leadership group and we had an organization  a representative from an organization that agriculture didn't align with and I get it  
**[2:09:31-2:09:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=2:09:31):**  if you send so something that's completely like wanting to shut agriculture down let's  call them PETA because it was okay but I won't name the farm organization so I get it there's  a higher agenda and so they will strategically send in a representative that knows like holder  
**[2:09:51-2:10:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=2:09:51):**  or say it again like as an opposing stakeholder to get that inside or well so they were this  individual was coming to speak to our group and to have an open dialogue but they were  told so what they know is this yeah so if you ask over here or over here they're gonna  
**[2:10:14-2:10:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=2:10:14):**  say I'm sorry I don't know any of that I know this whether they do or not that's all they  speak at or speak to and I get it I can appreciate the strategy that's fine the person that is  getting up this form organizations at my table and he sat with his back to this individual  
**[2:10:37-2:11:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=2:10:37):**  the whole time and I'm like I felt so embarrassed I get it I didn't I didn't agree with what  this speaker was saying their platform or whatever but I will give you the respect and  we will have an open dialogue conversation and this so the farm organization you need  
**[2:11:00-2:11:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=2:11:00):**  to have an open mind otherwise I mean you're gonna be reactive instead of being proactive  and I've never forgotten that I mean it's it has stuck with me because I've had conversations  after the fact with either a you know some legislation that we've introduced or whatever  
**[2:11:18-2:11:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=2:11:18):**  that and the dying farmer or rancher and I say that cautiously but it's a fact they're  getting older average Asian farmer rancher is getting older and the younger generation  is not coming back statistically it is a challenge so how do we how do we go around that how  
**[2:11:47-2:12:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=2:11:47):**  do we fix it how do we entice you know the young generation and so that's hopefully what  we are showing think outside the fence period do not just lay in I don't care as long as  you're successful whatever you're doing great then keep doing it but if you're struggling  
**[2:12:06-2:12:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=2:12:06):**  open up that mindset even if you are successful open up your mindset diversify look at things  you know differently because that's how you're going to challenge yourself you know mentally  physically personally so yeah that's that's just one thing I mean just have these these  
**[2:12:26-2:12:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=2:12:26):**  these conversations with someone that probably you know doesn't think like you I guess so  that's that's what we do so we do a lot of seminars a lot of conferences a lot of you  know one day tours will hit the fields the pastures so that's how it's kind of broken  
**[2:12:42-2:13:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=2:12:42):**  up my dad my younger brother will do a lot of that side of things holistic you know management  on the cattle and the rotational grazing crop management crop rotation mob grazing and then  once they come to the barn or the headquarters here then usually you know my dad will still  
**[2:13:10-2:13:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=2:13:10):**  be speaking with him because I'm sure I don't know your podcast with him was it was it like  10 hours I would assume 10 or 11 somewhere in there did you get him to shut did you have  to mute him it was actually here's what I'm gonna do I'm actually gonna have the interview  
**[2:13:27-2:13:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=2:13:27):**  I did with him spliced in before this so there's gonna be like almost a two and a half hours  don't fail don't Jay then Jerry okay Jerry then Jay so this isn't live then no we're  not going out live yeah I was I was I was wondering about that no I've got I do a minor  
**[2:13:47-2:14:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=2:13:47):**  amount of editing and that would have been good information to have Brian I literally  thought we were live and I'm like I'm gonna have to watch you know certain things I say  and just be fluid and whatever no I'm glad this can be edited now I can drop some f-bombs  
**[2:14:02-2:14:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=2:14:02):**  or whatever I'm kidding I'm not going I'm not gonna edit those out oh well that's that's  good to know all right well so then what I'm getting at you know coming to the barn I speak  on the I mean you talk financials and numbers I'm not but I do look at things from profitability  
**[2:14:25-2:14:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=2:14:25):**  standpoint my older brother does as well and so we are any business if it's not cutting  weight or cutting its own I mean it's it's we gotta we gotta access but if it's complimenting  okay this brewery for instance I mean you know I mean the first couple years were challenge  
**[2:14:47-2:15:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=2:14:47):**  and we're like what the hell are we doing but it was complimenting other businesses  so it's there's a need for that same you know when you juggle marketing to sales you spend  a ton of money on marketing do you get that return that's yeah that's always an interesting  
**[2:15:05-2:15:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=2:15:05):**  question isn't it like you got this advertising and marketing budget gonna get the name out  there gonna try to get brand recognition and people that you don't have that logo or that  name or slogan fixed in their mind so they'll come back later and buy your product like  
**[2:15:22-2:15:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=2:15:22):**  right it's oh that's difficult yeah yeah it's always a challenge I mean and that's I remember  when I was with us smokeless the sales guys hated us marketing guys hey we were doing  all the fun stuff and just blowing money left and right but without that marketing you're  
**[2:15:42-2:15:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=2:15:42):**  not gonna have those sales and without sales you're not gonna have the marketing budget  and so there's a happy I mean fine line I guess and you gotta compliment each other  and something that's been nagging on my mind  
**[2:15:58-2:16:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=2:15:58):**  since I was there and got to hang out with you and your dad and got to eat some black  leg beef where do you get your ingredients from for your beer when did you have black  leg beef oh at the at the yeah okay when we were downtown yeah I forgot about that  
**[2:16:18-2:16:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=2:16:18):**  all right so are you talking on the beer side yeah on the beer side where's your ingredients  from so well we try to use as much local ingredients as possible so you can either say all right  how do you get your recipes or how do you get your ingredients or what do you use or  
**[2:16:37-2:16:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=2:16:37):**  whatever so I'll touch on the ingredient side one of our biggest selling points for all  right well let me back up and as a bush everybody's got like a magic ingredient right right and  as a bush it's their yeast their yeast strain that they've been using for hundreds of years  
**[2:16:56-2:17:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=2:16:56):**  Coors it's their Rocky Mountain water exactly so you know so for us I grew up on well water  and I friggin love the taste of well water and when I built the brewery I said I don't  give a flying shit if anybody likes it I'm gonna brew the beer that I want to brew with

**[2:17:40-2:17:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=2:17:40):**  and it gets tested every two weeks if we didn't have it yeah okay I get it you know you can't  use you know terrible water or unhealthy water but to me drinking just naturally filtered  water is awesome and it's good taste that's a big selling point for us and a lot of accounts  
**[2:17:58-2:18:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=2:17:58):**  bars and restaurants use that to their advantage as a local brewery saying you guys I mean  this is what they do this is their process this is who they are whatever and it's worked  out well for us the grain the majority of our grain bill like 90% of it comes 20 minutes  
**[2:18:18-2:18:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=2:18:18):**  from here Lincoln North Dakota they're called two-track malting local guys local farmers  North Dakota farmers and so they have a malting facility and so yeah I mean pricing they might  be a little more expensive than the big boys we wanted to use local grain so we use that  
**[2:18:41-2:18:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=2:18:41):**  hops is different story that's the spice of beer can't probably grow hops in North Dakota  you can you can really yeah actually a lot of people do it however it's rather a new  thing that's just turned on and so we've tried some local farmers that first of all they  
**[2:18:59-2:19:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=2:18:59):**  can't produce enough that we need and then the consistency you know I mean you gotta  have I mean a few years under your belt before you know we invest a recipe around you know  that raw material and so Yakima Valley on the western coast we use them we get some  
**[2:19:26-2:19:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=2:19:26):**  hops out from Europe it just it just depends what we're going after good stuff it's water's  our selling point though in my opinion how many I don't care I mean to us not that it's  a huge selling point because branding is more of the selling point than anything you know  
**[2:19:45-2:20:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=2:19:45):**  our bison beer that we got some majestic beautiful animal or tap handle is a our eight-year-old  bowl you know sitting on top of the tap handle and so it's it's it's branding and so once  we get into packaging now that's going to just elevate the image and more brand awareness  
**[2:20:05-2:20:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/57-Jerry-and-Jay-Doan-Succession-Success--Blackleg-Ranch-e1g5erl#t=2:20:05):**  going forward good stuff I'm looking forward to seeing what you guys come up with me too  too but you mentioned earlier before we got started that you had another appointment you  had to get to so where can we find you on social media yeah so well we're a blackleg

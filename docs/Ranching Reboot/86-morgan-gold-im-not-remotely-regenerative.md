Welcome Morgan gold for episode 86  
**[0:01:47-0:02:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:01:47):**  Looking sound good  Yeah, man, you sound great. Awesome. Great.

Yeah, no versus yeah that there's nothing worse than a podcast with two people talking at the same time  That's that's a lot of my work in the editing process is trying to trim those out or clean those up  But yeah, some sometimes it's not so bad. So, uh, how you doing, man? I'm doing great  
**[0:02:15-0:02:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:02:15):**  I just got inside just was doing morning chores shot a video ready to roll ready to chat  Yeah, I well these early morning ones  It doesn't leave me quite enough time to get out to the ranch to get my chores done yet. So  
**[0:02:28-0:02:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:02:28):**  Before we get rolling  Why don't you tell us a little bit about a little bit about yourself like your name where you're at?  And when you kind of roll into it from there sure. So my name is Morgan gold  
**[0:02:37-0:02:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:02:37):**  I run a farm here in northern Vermont called Goldshaw farm  I've been doing it now for about four and a half years on our farm. We raised ducks geese chickens and cattle  And I'm very much a beginning farmer. I have no agricultural background. I grew up in the suburbs  
**[0:02:57-0:03:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:02:57):**  I spent like 20 years just kind of living in major northeastern cities and  Kind of had a midlife crisis in my like early mid 30s where I just kind of got fed up and said hey look  I want to go move to the middle of nowhere and start a farm and so that's what I've been doing the last couple of  
**[0:03:13-0:03:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:03:13):**  Years and we got a pack that a little bit more sure go for it  Okay, so so you're from that area what like I need to grow up on a farm  So what what's your education like and what you do for work for those few years and what led to the epiphany?  
**[0:03:28-0:03:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:03:28):**  Yeah, sure. So I you know grew up, you know, really like an artistic kid  Like I went to art school for college  and when I got out of school  
**[0:03:39-0:03:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:03:39):**  I was actually working just like at like Mark doing marketing and then eventually started to work at an investment company in an insurance company and  And so most of my professional career was basically working in investments and insurance and other financial products  I kind of fell into it really by accident  
**[0:03:57-0:04:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:03:57):**  I think the one trait I've always had that if you connect it from everything I've ever done is I'm a pretty good storyteller  And so whether it's me talking about, you know  Life insurance or talking about my farm  
**[0:04:10-0:04:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:04:10):**  I'm able to do it in a way that I think is interesting for folks  And and so that's how I kind of got to do and what I'm doing now, but you know from it from a education  Standpoint I had no background here  
**[0:04:24-0:04:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:04:24):**  it really wasn't until like my early 30s when my wife and I were living in New York City and she would go out to  the Union Square Farmers Market and she'd come home and bring home groceries every Saturday morning and she'd spend an  Insane amount of money and it would be great stuff. It would be like, you know, organic produce  
**[0:04:41-0:05:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:04:41):**  Grass-fed beef grass-fed lamb and I'd be like you're getting ripped off here. We're getting ripped off here  Like, you know, you're they're just you know, making you pay more money than it's actually worse versus if I just went to you know  The the key market and bought some some regular old meat. It's all the same thing once you cook it and she  
**[0:05:02-0:05:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:05:02):**  She kind of go ahead. Yeah key market is kind of like your supermarket  Yeah, Key Foods is just a New York City supermarket  but anyway, um and and and so basically she she  
**[0:05:13-0:05:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:05:13):**  challenged me to kind of do some more research and so I did and I started to read and I started to read more and  I started to go down called the regenerative agriculture  Sort of spiral ultimately getting down into you know folks like Mark Shepherd and kind of getting even deeper than that  
**[0:05:29-0:05:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:05:29):**  And and from there I started to say oh this is interesting and started an experiment where I started growing  tomatoes on the rooftop of our apartment in Brooklyn and  You know did that for a little while and then when we moved to Washington DC for work  
**[0:05:44-0:05:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:05:44):**  Started to I basically ripped up my front yard and putting garden beds and I was like, I want to keep getting bigger here  I want to keep going further and further and so that's what ultimately got us on this path of  Looking for our farm and finding it and saying hey  
**[0:05:58-0:06:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:05:58):**  Let's move back to New England and doing kind of what we're doing today  How nuts did your neighbors think you were when you ripped out your grass and DC and and started growing things to eat Oh  Completely insane because I mean just to set the picture for folks, right? So picture Capitol Hill  
**[0:06:13-0:06:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:06:13):**  So not just like, you know, the Washington DC area where people like from like, you know, Bethesda or Arlington say hey  I live in DC but like Washington DC proper in Capitol Hill in the southeast part of Capitol Hill where it's just  Nothing but row houses and we have this little postage stamp on  
**[0:06:29-0:06:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:06:29):**  That first weekend when I started ripping up flower beds and just putting in, you know raised beds  You know, my neighbors were all like what's going on here?  And and they really did think I was crazy for that first year until kind of I don't know maybe mid-summer  
**[0:06:44-0:06:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:06:44):**  when I started to have lots of stuff and started giving them food that we were growing and like people saw like kind of how  Productive the front yard was becoming that was sort of the first shift for them  But they definitely thought I was crazy those first couple months  
**[0:07:00-0:07:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:07:00):**  That's awesome, I was just sitting here thinking like  The tyranny of lawns like what what is the tyranny of lawns and lawn care done in this country?  I I posted a meme the other day on social media must be a couple weeks ago after the podcast comes out about  
**[0:07:16-0:07:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:07:16):**  There's a little kid  And his dad and his dad is like watering the grass and is saying, you know  Oh, we're growing all this wonderful grass and the kids like dad. Why are we growing something? We can't eat  
**[0:07:26-0:07:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:07:26):**  like  Completely, I mean the idea unless you have herbivores grazing your lawn  It's insane to have something that you maintain you water and then you have to mechanically mow and it's like  
**[0:07:40-0:07:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:07:40):**  You're just creating one big time suck and you're not getting out of it versus  If I look at the work that I was putting into my garden beds  It probably wasn't that much different  
**[0:07:49-0:08:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:07:49):**  But we weren't buying produce like six months out of the year and and that that makes a big difference  I I've had a thought for a long time like  Lawns in town were kind of invented to give urban folks the illusion of  
**[0:08:05-0:08:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:08:05):**  land ownership and land stewardship  I think that's very true. I think I think you know, they think about it, right?  the call it post-world War II vision of the white picket fence in the house and  
**[0:08:17-0:08:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:08:17):**  Every family has their own castle and that's what it is  You know, yeah, you need that little play space to make you feel like oh, I'm maintaining the grounds when it's yeah  You're you know  
**[0:08:28-0:08:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:08:28):**  Running a Cub Cabette over, you know, 200 square feet big deal  Then you get into some of those like subdivisions and housing  You know HOA is where it just becomes a contest who can have the the prettiest greenest most manicured perfect  
**[0:08:42-0:08:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:08:42):**  Looking lawn and there's just lines of chemical trucks lined up every morning at five o'clock to go  You know paint some paint everybody's lawns green. Oh  It is the worst hundred percent agreed  
**[0:08:54-0:09:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:08:54):**  Okay, so back to Morgan we're in Washington DC ripping up our lawn to grow tomatoes then what happened?  Well, so so the the next thing I really got into was tree crops where you know  I'm personally a huge believer in  
**[0:09:10-0:09:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:09:10):**  The power of call it the savannah-based ecosystem where you have you know  kind of large trees that are often nut bearing at the centerpiece mixed with grasslands and  That got me into thinking about well, how do I grow my own trees and wanting to have a space to grow trees?  
**[0:09:26-0:09:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:09:26):**  And so that's essentially what pushed me to ultimately explore getting some land  You know first and foremost to grow trees and and you know  It was actually the first 12 months that we bought our farm. We were still in DC  
**[0:09:38-0:09:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:09:38):**  We were working on fixing up the house and in order to make kind of use of the land  I was focused on sprouting trees and planting bare-root trees and you know, we put in about  I don't know 600 at the time we have about 700 now and a lot of those were planted  
**[0:09:53-0:10:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:09:53):**  Yeah back in like 2017 where now I'm able to look at them and they're you know  12 14 feet high and I'm so glad that that was the first thing I started with because  I'm just a huge believer in the power of trees  
**[0:10:04-0:10:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:10:04):**  So it and I agree with you that you know, like grasslands savannahs that that's probably a what a lot more  Of the country should look like  Probably not necessarily where I am. I'm I'm west of 35  
**[0:10:17-0:10:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:10:17):**  I'm west of the hundredth meridian and it just you know  This is supposed to be grassland and prairie but east of there  I agree with you 100% that you know  
**[0:10:25-0:10:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:10:25):**  we should be looking at a lot more open grasslands and savannahs with some big nut-bearing trees or trees that  provide  forage or shelter  
**[0:10:36-0:10:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:10:36):**  for an animal and  I'm kind of thinking like, you know, the Bradford pears and the elms that you know  Everybody went nuts planting in the last hundred years  
**[0:10:46-0:10:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:10:46):**  Yeah, those elms are kind of nice to look at and they spread everywhere and they grow really easy  But they don't provide a whole lot  They provide a lot of pollen to make everybody's allergies go nuts and you know  
**[0:10:55-0:11:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:10:55):**  Same thing with the Bradford pear right the Bradford pear is not an issue where I am at  It's you know, mostly I think farther east and I understand that  It's a pretty terrible plant, too  
**[0:11:06-0:11:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:11:06):**  Yeah, no  I mean look the reality is I think there's two things that you said there that are that are important to unpack  Number one, it's recognizing that the geography is going to dictate  
**[0:11:16-0:11:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:11:16):**  What's your appropriate ecosystem and and I find oftentimes in the farming and ranching space especially on the internet lately  Everybody is looking at their specific  Context and saying my context is just how the world should be and so people should be doing it the way that it works  
**[0:11:32-0:11:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:11:32):**  Here in you know, Montana or Missouri or Vermont and like recognize like that's not exactly the case  Where you know traditionally here in northern Vermont, right?  You know when agriculture kind of reared its head in the late 1700s  
**[0:11:48-0:12:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:11:48):**  You're talking about small sheep farms and small homesteads and then you know by the mid 1800s  You have essentially the emergence of dairy and small little hill farm dairies  Like that's the context that rooted for my land and so kind of getting back to something that is multi-use that is you know  
**[0:12:05-0:12:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:12:05):**  Kind of relatively leveraging a lot of different things in a single space  So I'm growing trees and raising poultry and doing cattle all in that same couple of acres  Like that's what works here  
**[0:12:17-0:12:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:12:17):**  That does not work in your ecosystem to your point like and and it's just recognizing that there is that distinction  So you need to manage your land differently accordingly  Yeah, well, it's you know, they added that as one of this  
**[0:12:29-0:12:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:12:29):**  the now six soil health principles is you have to know your context and  even if  Well, let's just say you know it even if your fence line neighbor is gonna have a different management  
**[0:12:43-0:12:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:12:43):**  Context due to his land base than you are and it's gonna drive him to make different  Management decisions whether you know, he's feeding twice the amount, you know  He's feeding hay for twice the days you are or a third the days you are or he has a completely different species mix on  
**[0:12:58-0:13:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:12:58):**  his land it's gonna be different for all of us and  You know social media  Social media is hard. You're you're you're great at it. Don't get me wrong. You're you're great  
**[0:13:08-0:13:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:13:08):**  I haven't even checked out your YouTube channel, but I see your your platinum YouTube plaque in the back  What's that for? Is that for a million subs?  Oh, no, I'm not a million. I think I'm just about to hit 700,000  
**[0:13:18-0:13:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:13:18):**  I think they they send it to you for a hundred I think is where that comes from  Yeah, I have like I don't think I have four thousand on YouTube  but I don't put a lot of time into YouTube either but  
**[0:13:28-0:13:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:13:28):**  I  Forget what I was gonna say. Oh social media. It just gives us a very very narrow window into somebody else's life and  I think folks think that they can take and draw a lot of conclusions from you know  
**[0:13:42-0:13:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:13:42):**  a one, you know a one minute or a three minute tick-tock or you know, a 12 minute YouTube video and  That it's it's so hard to tell a story in such a limited amount of time about a very very complex subject  That there's a lot of misinformation about. Oh, yeah  
**[0:13:58-0:14:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:13:58):**  No, no to do something right in three minutes or less you have to edit your details out  like there's no way around it and  That oversimplification can let you hit a lot of people and reach a lot of people with an important message  
**[0:14:12-0:14:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:14:12):**  But it can also leave other people saying but wait a minute. What about this? What about that? What about this?  What about that and leave them feeling like this is all sus and so it is the challenge in terms of how do you get  enough information to make it interesting compelling and shape how people see the world because I think there is  
**[0:14:29-0:14:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:14:29):**  an important role that regenerative agriculture needs to use social media for to help shift how  consumers and their purchasing habits behave and to ultimately get to a better way to produce food products  So I firmly believe that that sometimes means oversimplifying things that sometimes means keeping it  
**[0:14:49-0:15:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:14:49):**  you know kind of focus on one very narrow avenue when there's a lot of other things that need to happen at once and  It's unfortunate, but it's also the reality  Sometimes it's easier for me to keep making videos when I don't have something, you know blow up or go viral because  
**[0:15:05-0:15:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:15:05):**  Some the negative comments or the challenging comments  Maybe not necessarily challenging comments. Sometimes the folks that don't understand  quite a bit, you know, they ask a question that's pretty off-base and it's like  
**[0:15:20-0:15:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:15:20):**  There's no way I can even unpack that in three minutes.  Oh completely. Well, so here's the thing and I stopped doing this a while back and it was amazing for my mental health  In that I have completely given up trying to change what other people think and I've decided to put all of my energy into  
**[0:15:40-0:15:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:15:40):**  sharing my view of the world and how I think and if people want to get on the bus and come along  Awesome. Great. You know, I love love to have you but if they're gonna you know continue to throw stones and say  I know this guy is you know talking out his butthole like so be it that does not bother me that does not impact my view of myself  
**[0:15:59-0:16:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:15:59):**  If I did let that view of other that others have of me do that I would be just kind of huddled underneath the zen  desk like crying in a fetal position on a regular basis. I just can't do it. I feel like at this point and you just waste so much energy doing it too.  I just don't have the mental energy to do that anymore. So I'm just going to choose not to.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:16:24):**  One thing I want to know. So you said you bought the farm in northern Vermont and you lived in DC for a year.  I lived in DC for four years.  But yeah, well for a year while you had the farm and you're commuting back and forth. What was that commute like? I'm just curious.  
**[0:16:38-0:17:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:16:38):**  It was 539 miles of craziness. It kind of sucked because I would only get up to the farm, you know, for like maybe a week at a clip once a month was kind of how I was doing it.  I was trying to like work remotely, but I still had a job down in DC. I had you know, the house that we were fixing up here.  We had some stuff we were doing ourselves. We had a contractor doing some stuff. My wife actually moved up here even before I did.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:17:04):**  So she moved up here in the fall of summer of 2017. I didn't move up here full time until the spring of 2018.  And it was just simply, you know, by virtue of the fact that I had such a belief and conviction that I wanted to start this farm and knew that I had to get up here.  But what I did was basically look for a job up here because it's like I could afford to like just start farming and I and we can talk about this of like how to start a farm but like starting a farm with zero knowledge and experience and just a piece of land  
**[0:17:34-0:18:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:17:34):**  is the easiest way to not be running a farm two years from then. And so I knew I wanted to have a day job to be essentially my training wheels to keep me going and help me learn while I try to get customers set up and a business stood up and build a brand to do all  of these things you need to, to have a thriving business. And so, you know, basically I was looking for a job up here while still working down there and, you know, having my life in like three different places and I mean, it kind of sucked.  Looking back on it now it's totally worth it but yeah that was like a really crap 18 months.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:18:09):**  So what I guess let's let's just dive right into that how to start a farm with no knowledge and no capital and no experience.  Yeah, well so I mean, here's the thing I think when people talk about starting a farm. I feel like they often go to production as the first thing that you need to think about and starting a farm.  I need to know how to raise this thing or I need to have this type of equipment to plant this type of thing like they're very focused on the tactical activities required to start producing.  
**[0:18:40-0:19:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:18:40):**  When I would actually argue that thinking about your target customers and thinking about their needs and creating an engagement with them and building a brand is arguably more important than the production side of it.  I mean, you obviously can't have one without the other. But I think so often people focus on the production one because that's the, that's the call it satisfying that's the one that your image of well what's a farmer is that versus somebody who's a marketer.  And, you know, particularly if you're looking to do direct sale retail which is essentially what we do right right. You need to be thinking about what's your brand you need to think about your distribution strategy you need to be thinking about your customers  
**[0:19:18-0:19:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:19:18):**  and so what happened is when I moved up here full time in the spring of 2018. I knew I wanted to start with one product, which would help me learn how to raise some animals learn if I like these animals or not learn if it's all there and figure out if I  want to even get a viable business model going. And so I went with ducks, and I went with duck eggs, because, yeah, well, number one. Nobody was doing duck eggs around here, everybody around here had backyard chickens.  Number two, I knew it was a product I could probably produce a premium for. And so it was like those two factors said, let me start here, and then three, the cost and barrier to entry was small.  
**[0:19:57-0:20:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:19:57):**  And so the first year to raise 40 ducks, you know I'm talking about, I don't know, $1,800 in sunk cost. So if I if I do it for a year and hate it and walk away.  Big deal it's it's no skin off my nose, versus if I look at what I sunk to get into cattle last year and get my herd started. Oh, good Lord. Yeah, you know I'm talking six or seven times that and so like that reality is if you're going to be a beginner  and you're going to be a beginner, you know you're going to be a beginner and you're going to be a beginner and you're going to be a beginner and you're going to be a beginner and you're going to be a beginner.  
**[0:20:35-0:21:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:20:35):**  And so that's why I see I see people bag on, you know homesteaders and beginning farmers who start with poultry saying oh that's not real farming, when I think that that's probably the best possible avenue other than market gardening you can go into, because  I started with those ducks, and my thinking was at the time. Gosh, I need to have customers who want to buy these these duck eggs. Let me start making videos of me learning how to start this farm so that, you know, six months from now when I finally have  product to sell. I'm not starting at zero then I've actually at least maybe tried to build up a little bit of attention for myself. And so that's pretty much what I did and so I started doing like two YouTube videos a week, while I was starting with the ducks  
**[0:21:17-0:21:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:21:17):**  and raising the ducks and when they first showed up and the experience of going from there. You know, I've also had these trees here that I've been maintaining and so I knew that in a couple years I'd have tree crops that I'd be selling and so it was again I was trying  to build the brand simultaneously with trying to build the farm, which I know is not the usual thing and I know some will poo poo it but I feel like that's what helps set me up so that as I do other products now.  I've got a built in audience ready to go and that's where you know back to my point of you can either focus on production or you can focus on your distribution I lean heavily on the distribution side of things.  
**[0:21:50-0:22:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:21:50):**  Okay, so you're talking about, you have a background in marketing you're talking about building your audience and building your market before you even have a product to sell and before they even know that they want to buy it, which I totally dig.  And I think what where we've gone wrong in agriculture with farming and ranching is so many of us aren't great marketers. And we've given up our market power to, you know, things like, you know, the beef checkoff, oh just give us $1 off every head you sell  we'll promote your product for it or you know the chicken, or there's no chicken check off because that's all vertically integrated before they had a chance but you know, they did it with a pork check off soybean check off corn check up, I mean, you name it there's,  
**[0:22:33-0:23:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:22:33):**  there's, there's a board or organization that's responsible for promoting almost everything. And that's because we suck at marketing. I suck at marketing I'm trying to get better.  And, but really that's that's kind of the critical part about farming and ranching is, yeah, we can grow something great, who's gonna buy it.  And you hit on something important like everybody's got backyard chickens, so if you have backyard chickens, and you're selling your eggs for $1 you're killing the rest of the industry either give the damn things away or charge five bucks charge an honest price, or give them away.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:23:11):**  And I completely agree with that and I have long felt and this is why I don't do I do egg production and sales now.  Most of my focus is on selling fertilized eggs through the mail, where I can charge a premium for it, eating eggs, both chicken and duck. I do like locally here, but it's much more just to get rid of them, and yeah I charge I think it's like I do six  bucks a dozen for duck eggs and five bucks a dozen for chicken eggs and like that is reasonable people will pay that.  
**[0:23:43-0:24:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:23:43):**  But it's not a focus because even at that price. The margin isn't even good enough for me to want to expand out and really try to get scale, you know, the ducks are here for my, my basically my breeding stock and the chickens are here to help fly control  my, my cattle and give me some farm chicken eggs like that's the only reasons are here. The commercial offshoot of that is just simply a byproduct but I think you're right.  Too oftentimes people will just be, especially like a homesteader who's just starting and they're inundated with eggs and you can always see these giant baskets of eggs that they've collected over a week or two not realizing that yeah if you have two dozen  
**[0:24:19-0:24:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:24:19):**  eggs, you're going to be getting, you know, easily. A couple hundred eggs a week that like that sort of thing is like not something people are used to and so yeah they want to make $2 off of them but that actually hurts more than just giving it away I completely  agree.  So something I was just thinking about you said, you know, the chickens are there to provide fly control for your cows, and that that's their primary and maybe a few eggs for you, and not to make money.  
**[0:24:50-0:25:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:24:50):**  And I really appreciate that maybe we can unpack that a little bit because they're not just doing flight control they're also adding fertility.  They're, they're doing some light tillage on the ground. And there's a lot of benefits that they're bringing to the ecosystem that aren't necessarily tangible benefits you can attach a dollar value to, but you can't attach a dollar value to the fly control,  like what's.  
**[0:25:14-0:25:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:25:14):**  And I'm not I'm not saying you might have these figures but you know, if you don't have to do pour on on your cattle because they don't have any flies, because you have chickens controlling your fly larva and the manure pads, you know, that's a cost savings  that can be attributed to the chickens.  Yes, so, I mean, there's some complexity there though right and yeah like.  
**[0:25:34-0:26:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:25:34):**  All right, so  that $30 bottle of ultra boss that you know from my heart like, I mean like if you try to do the map there, but I actually I'm genuinely trying to avoid using permethrin avoid using like things like Ivermectin just simply because the, the more I've been doing  this, and I'm still so much of a beginner I don't mean to emphasize like I have expertise at all, but the more I've been doing this the more I'm realizing that my job as the farmer more than anything else is to be the balancer of an ecosystem, where, you know,  
**[0:26:06-0:26:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:26:06):**  I've got some column anchor features of them, including the grass, the trees, the cattle, but then I have some column helper activities that exist there so things like my chickens, which are helping in terms of managing pests and insects.  And yeah, providing some light soil disturbance.  I have things like my livestock guardian dogs right, which are providing predator protection so we do non lethal predator control here so I've got two livestock guardian dogs who help keep you know essentially a bubble around and act in the role of the  
**[0:26:41-0:27:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:26:41):**  next predator, keeping the coyotes and the bobcats and the foxes away from my birds, all my ducks geese and chickens all actually free range during the summer months 24 seven so I don't lock them up, I have a perimeter fence and dogs and that's it.  And I haven't lost anybody in a couple years now and doing that type of setup.  But that's again because of the ecosystem, I even have barn cats right because if you have poultry like ducks and chickens, you need to feed them green that green attracts rodents those rodents attract disease as well as attract other predators because  
**[0:27:15-0:27:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:27:15):**  coyotes favorite things to eat or mice. And so by having the barn cats there, they're suppressing the rodent population which is also trying to keep things in balance and so what I'm finding the more and more that I've been working on my farm is the more  I need to think about how things create a balance and so yes there's the added benefit of I don't have to use a poor on to manage my fly populations.  But what I'm also finding is it's not like simple like you just need chickens like I found I need to do a little trapping to manage my fly numbers too and, but at the advantage of not doing the poor on is you could argue that some of the, you know,  
**[0:27:48-0:28:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:27:48):**  micro life in the soil is a little bit better off because I'm not putting a poor on on like it so your, your point of trying to find it economic benefit is true and fair.  I have done a very poor job of trying to discover that myself. But what I am seeing is holistically is all these things kind of start to work together, there's a benefit in that.  And I think you're on a great point, like, there's a lot of things that we might not be able to economically quantify, but there's a lot of things that we can ecologically qualify.  
**[0:28:21-0:28:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:28:21):**  100% and here's the thing when I do a business case for any of the products I have on my farm.  Like I'm going to go to the cattle, the trees, the geese, especially. I'm running that business case as a standalone. So, how much is it costing me to keep these cattle.  How much am I spending, you know, monthly or annual basis to manage them. What am I going to get as a return and like seeing if those numbers work out.  
**[0:28:50-0:29:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:28:50):**  I actually just sent my first steer off to the processor last week and so that's exciting. The Oh yeah no so the case is still open on that one but I did do a whole set of numbers and assumptions to get there.  My geese which I've been doing geese for me for three years now are you said meat, meat, meat geese Yeah, I assume that you were doing eggs with those. No, no.  So I do breeding stock and meet with the geese.  
**[0:29:18-0:30:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:29:18):**  I'm going to go a whole nother tangent but let me make the case that geese are the most ecologically sustainable form of poultry you can raise the better than ducks, they're better than chickens, they're better than turkeys.  Ducks, chickens and turkeys right, you got to bring in grain you got to bring in feed you've got all this input cost in us in an ecosystem like ours here in Vermont, where we have great grass growth growth for about six months a year.  So what I'm able to do is hatch out my geese here on the farm. And then after about week four or five switch their diet over to where they're getting about 90% of their diet from the pasture so they're eating grass they're eating weeds geese or grazers.  
**[0:30:01-0:30:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:30:01):**  And so they're not they don't have the same kind of ruminant stomach setup as like a sheep or a cow, but they they are grazers they get most of their diet from that grass. And so my input costs on my geese to get like a 20 pound goose that I can charge you know  a pound for I'm able to actually do that with less grain than it's taking to feed my you know four or five pound egg laying ducks. And so, you know, the fact that there's such a little input there becomes how I make that business case and so yeah there's  like a whole spreadsheet and I've done like YouTube videos on where I go through the spreadsheet on the assumptions of how much does it cost to raise and produce a gosling, how much does it cost to you know feed them over the course of the year.  
**[0:30:47-0:31:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:30:47):**  I have my butchering week that we do here next week for all my poultry so all the birds that aren't going to stay around for winter for breeding stock go into the freezer.  And then that's when I start to do my sales again and so yeah it's like you got to build a business case for that by itself. Do the geese have other benefits in terms of, you know, helping you know essentially clean up behind the cattle, they definitely do.  I don't want to economically quantify it though because they already stand by themselves, economically, and to your point it's more qualitative ecological impact that I'm happy to reap that benefit even though I'm not going to try to assign the number  
**[0:31:24-0:32:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:31:24):**  just because I don't see the point in doing it like I wouldn't act any differently.  I think we might spend a lot of time chasing our tails trying to quantify, you know, ecological benefits like that in terms of dollars I don't think it's possible because you can't replicate the complex dance of biology with with a solution in a bottle.  Completely I mean look here's something that I feel like I've learned from my time in corporate America, when we would very regularly do budgeting exercises for departments and doing pricing exercises for new products and like the, you know, kind of lick your  
**[0:32:02-0:32:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:32:02):**  finger and put it up to the wind type of math that would have to happen to make some of these wild ass assumptions that people are definitely just pulling out of their butt.  Like, you know, it was it was just a big waste of time. And so, now that I'm a small business owner myself now that I'm doing my own thing. I really try to focus my energy on doing planning and assumptions for things that matter versus the things that don't  like asking myself the question, how will I act any differently if I know these numbers versus if I don't, and to your point, like, make the decision whether or not I should change, chase my tail.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:32:36):**  Okay.  So let's talk about how to start a farm now.  I mean, and I'm not sure if I'm doing it right. I mean, like, let me like be 100% transparent right?  
**[0:32:51-0:33:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:32:51):**  I suffer from imposter syndrome constantly, like, but there's, there's no such thing as the grazing police.  Right. If there was, there's a lot of folks around me that would probably be in serious trouble with the grazing police if such a thing existed. So there's nobody called the grazing police that's going to come tell you how you're doing it wrong.  There's no regenerative agriculture police that are going to come write you a ticket for doing regenerative agriculture wrong. Like, guys can go load up with Roundup and go spray that so that's okay. Nobody's going to judge us.  
**[0:33:26-0:34:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:33:26):**  Yeah, no, I think that's fair. I mean, look, what I have found that has personally worked for me has been start small and focus on profitability. So again, back to that point of, you know, kind of mistake number one I see people is they jump in with both  their feet when I'd argue you're much better dipping some toes in and seeing if you like the temperature of the water versus like taking the full plunge, going to the bank and getting a million bucks and buying a couple thousand acres and a couple.  It's like, like I can't admit like it's hard enough being a beginning farmer and struggling and trying to figure stuff out and learn stuff without the pressure of a whole bank note you got to pay down on and like you got to like make sure you can feed your family  
**[0:34:13-0:34:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:34:13):**  and figure yourself right out of the gate start small I think that's number one but then number two, focus on being profitable focus on, you know, trying to price your products appropriately, trying to find a market, don't try to scale up until you have  confidence in that market, I think, you know, as much as people like to focus on production in agriculture. I think the market development and distribution strategy is arguably more of the success, defining factor.  When you think about the long term sustainability of a farm.  
**[0:34:48-0:35:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:34:48):**  I agree. So, kind of continuing in the marketing vein.  You don't like farmers markets, and I get why. And we've heard that podcast listeners will know that we've heard it a dozen times already, that farmers markets are a great place to go get exposure but not a great place to generate a lot of sales.  Oftentimes it's a break even or money losing operation to go to farmers markets is that track with you.  
**[0:35:17-0:36:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:35:17):**  And this much like your land management practices, I feel like is a, it depends on your context type of question. So, I live in the second least populated state in the United States in the poorest most rural corner of that state in a town of 700  people from a market development standpoint, I either can sell locally here to a very few people who don't even necessarily want to pay a premium for my product, or I can hop in the truck and drive to Burlington and maybe have a slightly bigger market  but now I'm going to drive 90 minutes there 90 minutes back or hop in the truck and drive down to Boston which is three hours away, which is a bigger market and I would be able to sustain what I want to do from a profitability standpoint but then that's three  
**[0:36:07-0:36:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:36:07):**  hours down and three hours back that I'd be doing like once a week and all of that seems horrible to me, versus the fact that because I've built a strong brand in social media and built a pretty big footprint across, you know, all the major platforms.  It gives me the opportunity to do internet sales. And so for example, as I get ready to do my goose harvest and duck harvest I'm 100% sold out on ducks. I've got a couple of geese still leftover, but at this point, everybody's purchased my product  already through my website, and I'm ready to go.  
**[0:36:39-0:37:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:36:39):**  One of the other things I'm doing with my beef right is I'm creating a line of beef tallow so I know I have a customer base that's going to be ready to buy it on day one the minute I listed on my website.  If I just do like a quick live stream to promote it right again it's recognizing my context is very different than say your context and so it kind of depends if I was, if it was me, and I had a family and I had a whole bunch of people working with me,  it might make perfect sense to start selling down in Boston to and I could scale up more and sell in Boston, but it just doesn't make sense for my situation.  
**[0:37:14-0:37:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:37:14):**  I think depending on where your farms located depending on what that market looks like and depending on what your time and labor situation is farmers markets could be great for you.  The reason I challenge kind of the small farm orthodoxy of, hey, you need to be thinking about farmers markets as your mode of distribution is because I think people automatically put themselves in a box versus really stepping back and saying, what would be the  most advantageous play for me given the context of my farm. What's the easiest way for me to get my product in front of my customers that don't even know they want it.  
**[0:37:49-0:38:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:37:49):**  Exactly, exactly. And where do I have demand and where don't I, and it's much easier to sell into a market where there's already demand versus trying to create demand yourself, which, if we want to come back to you know how I said I started with  duck eggs. The reason I don't do duck eggs for eating as a real business line anymore is because there was no demand I was finding I had to create the demand, and that's a lot more work versus, you know, people who want to hatch ducks is a market to  I can charge a premium for that, and I'm not limited geographically and I can do my sales over the internet so let me focus there instead and it's it's being able to recognize the landscape and shift your business model to match that landscape to.  
**[0:38:33-0:39:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:38:33):**  Okay.  And with your geese your revenue generator with the geese is just the meat you're not doing eggs with the geese. I also do fertilized egg sales with the geese. And so it's like, you know, for fertilized goose eggs can fetch you 60 bucks or 65 bucks shipping pay  that's that was what I was charging this past year and it's pretty much always sold out. And so that's one part of the business model exactly. But now if I'm thinking about my goose business right, and this is where as a business line geese are like one  
**[0:39:07-0:39:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:39:07):**  big thing but there's a couple facets to it. Geese only lay eggs from call it February to mid to late May, so it's a tight window. And they're not very prolific producers are they they don't produce very many eggs.  Um, you know your average female will push out three maybe four eggs during peak laying season. In those months. And so, you know what I will do is typically from February to early April it's much too early for me to hatch eggs here.  And so that's when I'm selling my eggs, you know, in the mail. And when I do that, essentially, I'm covering most of my feed costs for the winter, because while geese are really really cheap and easy to raise in the summer, they can be kind of pricey to  
**[0:39:57-0:40:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:39:57):**  raise in the winter because they need a lot of food, and they're not getting it from the pasture when we have four feet of snow on ground.  And so, you know, that part offsets my costs, I'm able to still have breeding geese though so I can do my own hatching on farm, which so rather than paying about 22 to $24 per Gosling if I was buying from a hatchery.  I'm essentially hatching them for free because I've already covered my breeding parent costs by selling the hatching eggs in the early part of the season. And now, basically I have these hatchlings that are relatively cheap to raise that I can then charge  
**[0:40:34-0:40:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:40:34):**  a premium for when I harvest them in early October for me.  So it's like, it's an it's an enterprise that has multiple facets but they all kind of fit together into the bigger business strategy, and it takes, it takes advantage of my climate my seasons my context.  Okay.  
**[0:40:52-0:41:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:40:52):**  Well let's, let's talk a little bit about that since you mentioned winter feeding on the geese and I'm assuming.  I just have this. Some reason I have this vision in my head of like a power wheel size little feed truck with a little miniature round bale and he's going out and he's unrolling it in front of the herd of ducks that are following along like cows.  I know that's completely off base.  
**[0:41:17-0:41:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:41:17):**  You can't feed geese hay.  So what do you feed geese in the winter?  It's grains and cracked corn. You know, basically it's not that different than chicken or duck feed, you just want to reduce your protein a little bit and so usually I'll add like cracked corn to cut that.  
**[0:41:33-0:41:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:41:33):**  But that's that's that's basically it.  Okay, so that.  I guess we're kind of dancing around, you know, you're in northern Vermont which is obviously far north, lot farther north than I am. And you said you have snow on the ground four feet of snow on the ground for the year so let's talk about, let's talk about  
**[0:41:52-0:42:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:41:52):**  like your forage chain.  Now, obviously right now you're probably getting ready to come out of pasture and start heading towards the barns so how do you care for, for lack of a better term, your menagerie of livestock during the winter in the barns and how do you store up feed for them.  Yeah, so I mean, the farm has kind of two maybe three configurations there's like winter configuration and summer configuration. We're still in summer configuration I'd hope to be in summer configuration into call it mid to late October, but essentially  
**[0:42:26-0:43:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:42:26):**  becomes weather dependent if we get a big snowstorm in late October, everybody comes in and we're just done.  When it comes to the, you know, ducks, geese and chickens. What I've actually found is the best way to house them is in like a large greenhouse. I had a 50 by 12 greenhouse that I was keeping all my birds in last year.  And so I'm in the process of finishing right now, we're actually rolling out the plastic tomorrow, 100 by 20 foot hoop house, essentially, that's going to house all my birds and I'm going to actually be trying to grow some of their feed in there in the summer  
**[0:43:03-0:43:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:43:03):**  and so basically I kind of house them in there they have like a little yard that they can go into but rather than being free range they're now kind of partially housed in this hoop coop, as well as house and like they have like an outdoor paddock.  The cattle is every is everything commingled or do you have like different sections for chickens ducks and geese. Um, so, in years past I've had everybody separate last year I combined the geese and chickens together that worked out pretty well.  I'm going to try combining the ducks geese and chickens altogether I believe that should work out pretty well.  
**[0:43:36-0:43:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:43:36):**  They segregate themselves essentially in terms of how they want to sleep and how they want to like kind of spend their time like you know the chickens are going to want to roost the geese and ducks are going to want to be on the ground.  And they basically build nests out of straw. And so, so they, they kind of do it for you.  And so it's not that different from that perspective.  
**[0:43:57-0:44:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:43:57):**  So, I just wonder if there's like, you know, if there's competition or, you know, the, the, my experience with geese is geese are dicks.  Like these are assholes like that that's my experience with them. I'll call that a little bit of a myth. So, during breeding season and mating season, they can be very aggressive, if you're going in there and taking eggs out of their nest.  I've gotten bites on my fingers before like that that can definitely happen. But overall, especially because you know every goose on our farm, pretty much every goose on our farm, I raised from at least a day old or younger.  
**[0:44:34-0:45:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:44:34):**  And so, you know, I've always been kind of ever present so I never have any trouble working with them. They assessed, essentially all the birds will establish a pecking order.  And so when you commingle your birds, the ducks, geese and chickens also have their pecking order. The geese are at the top of the pecking order you just resolve that. They're always going to be the ones that eat first out of the trough, they're going to be the ones  that push everybody out of the way. But once they have their fill they're actually very good about getting out of the way and then the ducks and chickens come in and so as long as you're not like scarcity feeding them, it's not a big deal.  
**[0:45:08-0:45:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:45:08):**  Okay. Yeah. Okay. And I'm talking like, you know, last year I had about 50 geese that I overwintered so this isn't like a tiny tiny like you know I got three three geese and, you know, 10 ducks like it was, you know, good size population.  But it's also not like you know you've got a confinement barn with 40,000 of them either.  Oh completely I mean and you know making you know that space piece I think is a biggie right where, you know, like my bird yard, the one that they have access to in the summer it's like that's 10 acres of space that they can go to and so that keeps a lot  
**[0:45:39-0:46:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:45:39):**  of problems and kind of violence and flock fighting from happening just by having that space that everybody can spread out just that alone.  Okay, because what's the rule for cage free or free range, when they can label that something like one square foot or something, one or two square feet yeah it's something ridiculous which if you actually think about what that looks like, it's like,  that's not good at all.  
**[0:46:06-0:46:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:46:06):**  Like, one chicken for two square feet and calling that free range would be like one of us trying to live in a tiny house for a year, even worse than that be like one of us living in a closet for a year like, I mean it's not good it's Yeah, I think,  you know, that's where you're going to have your flocks picking on each other and you're going to have rises in cannibalism and that sort of thing it's when you have that factor of space reduced, I mean that makes a big difference.  Okay, so kind of getting back to the weather and I should have done this earlier.  
**[0:46:40-0:47:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:46:40):**  I have a friend in Pittsfield, Massachusetts who runs a restaurant and I was talking to him this morning.  And he says, his name's Luke, he says, it would be cool to learn about the difficulties that come with raising livestock in the harsh New England weather specifically the six months of cold and snow.  Yeah, I mean, it's hard I mean so with the birds, you know, I constantly have water freezing, and I'm breaking that up.  
**[0:47:06-0:47:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:47:06):**  But birds themselves are actually pretty hardy.  You know that that's partially why I've always been so focused on ducks and geese from a cold hardy perspective, they're really good in the cold, I specifically shoes breeds of chickens that are good, you know, small combs, you know, good for cold hardiness  for that reason, you know, I've had a little bit of frostbite in the past but it's never been too bad but yeah we can get negative 20 degrees Fahrenheit pretty regularly we can go a week or two with never getting over zero degrees Fahrenheit for a chunk  
**[0:47:40-0:48:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:47:40):**  of time and so that part is hard, but you get used to it with the cattle so last year was my first year of housing the cattle in the winter.  You know, number one I went with a hardy breed there. We have Scottish Highlands. And so that makes a difference like you know if I had like Corianni or something right.  I don't think they would work in this context nearly as well, maybe they might. I think your grass is way too good for Coriannis to do well. I don't know Highlands, I've got some real crap grass and Highlands do pretty good with crap grass too so like,  
**[0:48:15-0:48:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:48:15):**  but but I you know I have a hardier breed and so the way it works is I basically create a yard.  You know around my barn I have this gigantic three story former dairy barn. I keep them in the basement of that, so they can get a shelter if they need it, I have, you know, a water trough that's heated, because I have electricity in the barn and so that's where  they'll get their water, but they usually still spend most of their time outside in the yard. And then I'm typically feeding either dry or silage round bales over the course of the winter to them.  
**[0:48:53-0:49:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:48:53):**  And I basically do that from probably early November to early-ish May is kind of the window that I'm feeding them that hay.  You know I got everything just just got it fully loaded up here for the winter, I'm ready to go as well as a couple of additional cattle that we're gonna be adding pretty soon.  And so I'm, you know, I'm ready for winter. I'm just basically now at the point of, as soon as I get a big snowstorm I'll probably move them in, because the way the snow works here and this is where you know when you debate people who say oh you should never  
**[0:49:25-0:49:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:49:25):**  feed your cattle hay, you know, we're going to get a snowstorm in probably... I won't even say you should never feed hay. I know I'm exaggerating. I won't even say that.  I'm exaggerating but, but I guess the point is this, we will get a snowstorm in early November, and we will not see the ground again until late April at the earliest.  And essentially we'll get snowstorm after snowstorm. It'll accumulate until you get to the point where yeah you got about three or four feet if you get a good heavy winter.  
**[0:49:55-0:50:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:49:55):**  And, you know, it doesn't matter if they're Scottish Highlands with their big horns and they're, you know, kind of able to dig through, they're not going to be able to access anything that you have underneath that ground and so, you know, creating a setup  where you can efficiently feed hay, and you have the ability to kind of bring your animals in, that's what I found is sort of the need, but then, you know, the second that things sort of start to perk up, and I start to see some green grass of May, boom  I'll try to put them back outside again even if it's giving them more space than they have, because I'm at this point trying to do two pasture moves a day, most days with the cattle so you know relatively small grazing cell, open that up, kind of do it again  
**[0:50:35-0:51:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:50:35):**  do it again and, you know, I've been finding that that's working really great so far this whole summer, and I'll be back to doing that again next spring.  Awesome. So, I was just, I was trying to place Northern Vermont, like with latitude on a map is where you're at.  You're kind of about where North Dakota would be like similar latitude or? Yeah, kind of, I mean it's a slightly different climate because of mountains and, you know, weather patterns. And the Atlantic Current. Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:51:07-0:51:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:51:07):**  But yeah, no, so we're about 50 miles south of the Canadian border.  So, you know, pretty much up there.  Elevation wise and I know people out west are going to scoff but here it's high I think we're about 1400 feet or so. And, and, and I got my elevations like over 2000 feet.  
**[0:51:29-0:52:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:51:29):**  I know I know. Look here. It's like you know you know, Vermont is like the Green Mountain state even right, you know, we're in the mountains here, like, and so you know that that, you know, gets us pretty cold, like, but, um, yeah,  North Dakota I think would be a fair ish comparison, depending on what part of North Dakota. North Dakota is a relatively big state compared to Vermont. Yeah, I was just trying to place, you know, I just tried to make sure I had a concept of where you were, you know, north south.  Yeah, I think we are at like the almost the 45th line there.  
**[0:52:07-0:52:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:52:07):**  Oh, wow. Yeah, so that's, that's a lot further north than I am. I don't know what latitude I'm at but I know them about 9835 longitude on the wrong side of that hundred line.  See, so where do we go.  You know you're talking about, you know, having four feet of snow and your Highlands can't quite get under it.  
**[0:52:29-0:52:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:52:29):**  And you're talking about the weather.  We'll get the cold will get the snow, but then it warms right back up so like the worst we kind of almost had the two worst winners we've had that I can ever remember.  So winter of 20 or February of 2021. We had like 14 days where it didn't fall, we had 13 days where the sun didn't come out, and that whole business started off with a half inch ice storm.  
**[0:52:57-0:53:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:52:57):**  So we had a half an inch ice come in and cover everything up.  And it got down. I think it was 10 or 12 degrees.  That next that morning, when we got out there.  
**[0:53:10-0:53:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:53:10):**  And it's like, okay, there's a half inch ice.  And, you know, I'm sitting in pasture stockpile that was well over 2000 pounds an acre. So you were talking waist high grass and a lot of places.  Okay, we're covered up with ice. Time to go get some hay. So when I got a bale of feed and a bale of alfalfa and I rolled them both out.  
**[0:53:31-0:53:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:53:31):**  And my hunter cows just kept walking back and forth. So I sit there and I watched and saw what they're doing.  So, every all the snow and ice came in on a north wind. So it caught on on north side of all the plants and all my tall stockpile.  So what they do is they would start at the south end of the pasture.  
**[0:53:52-0:54:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:53:52):**  And they would just kind of line out east to west. And they would go on this grazing path from south to north, and they had their heads down, and they were looking underneath all that stockpile on the on the lee side of all that grass and the sagebrush and everything, and they could still go in and find green grass to eat underneath the snow and ice.  Oh, they will find it anyway anyway they can I mean even my, my animals will like you can see the edge of the fence right, and you can see them like just sticking their nose through it to get like those last little bits of green nub in that come because the fence  heats up a little bit more melts the ice a little bit more like like cattle remarkable animals when it comes to finding the best available forage.  
**[0:54:36-0:55:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:54:36):**  And I think the tricky thing is like to what you just described right. It sounds like that's like a typical conditions. I think it's actually harder to be in that type of setting where you can have to deal with that surprise versus ours where we have such,  you know, kind of stout winters that we just have to go into winter mode, and you know November to marches, or November to May is gonna suck. Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, that's up but it's just I know I have to feed them with the tractor like I know that that like that's baked into my plan and so I just you know just like with the ducks and geese.  
**[0:55:09-0:55:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:55:09):**  I know I got to run them water three times a day and that their water drops are going to be frozen so I want rubber water drops that I can just stop empty and be able to refill again instantly versus, you know, trying to thought out an ice pond or try to  fight the ice. It's just you build a way to farm, based on your context, and you can go with it. When you get those curve balls that throws you off like for me actually the biggest curve ball is like a January thought.  And like if we if it heats up and suddenly I have a week or two where it's like 40, which happened this past year which was like weird. Then I've got mud everywhere where I didn't expect mud.  
**[0:55:47-0:56:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:55:47):**  I've got, you know, messes coming together it's turning it like, you know, things are falling apart like it's not what I want to see, like that's actually a bigger problem for me so it's not so much the harsh condition it's the unexpected abnormal condition  that I think is much harder to contend with.  I would agree with that, and the cold that we've had the last two years in February, has definitely been unexpected.  
**[0:56:15-0:56:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:56:15):**  I can remember a year.  There's one year we got over six feet of snow in the winter.  And it came in, in three big dumps, and it one dump was, it was two feet. Then one was three feet and one was two feet.  
**[0:56:30-0:56:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:56:30):**  But mostly, you know, that's a four or five day event.  And I was going back through before I bought my cattle so let's clarify here. So I've been on the ranch, been out of the Navy and back on the ranch since 2006.  I didn't buy cows until 2020, so I'm fairly new at this too.  
**[0:56:49-0:57:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:56:49):**  But I did spend a lot of years growing other people's cattle, taking in taking care of other people's cattle and understanding.  And understanding how to graze the ranch and how the forage, you know, and how the forage grows and responds and, you know, all that stuff so I think I understand my grass and my land a lot better than I understand how to use it correctly with cattle.  I'm still learning.  
**[0:57:17-0:57:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:57:17):**  But like I said, you know, I'm, I'm kind of new to it too, and figuring out the marketing is a challenge and I forgot where I was going with that.  Oh, but as before I bought the cows I was kind of going back through, you know, all of dad's weather records and you know what everything was, what the winters have been like because my dad bless his heart has kept really good precipitation and temperature records.  Since like 1984.  
**[0:57:45-0:58:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:57:45):**  Like he journaled for years, like you know he would make an observation about what the weather was doing and what the weather was and he's, he's been tracking rainfall he tracks rainfall to the hundredth of an inch.  I'm not quite that crazy I'll just track it to the 10th and be good but you know he likes to track those hundreds you know how much range you get. I had 67 hundreds.  I had 70 dad that's fine.  
**[0:58:10-0:58:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:58:10):**  That's impressive though to have that like kind of log to be able to see the kind of what your lands been doing that that long a period of time. Oh, it gets even better than that, Morgan we can chart.  We can chart grass growth in terms of inches of grass, you know inches of grass per acre, based on rainfall.  And based on, you know, temperature.  
**[0:58:34-0:58:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:58:34):**  So we kind of have an understanding of how the grass is going to grow through the year based on, you know, years and years of forage samples we know, you know, when we're going to grow a lot of this we're going to grow a little this and when dormant  season is when we need to do different things but.  So, what I'm getting at is, I went through all of his weather records.  
**[0:58:56-0:59:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:58:56):**  And I looked at the National Weather Service archives.  And I figured.  14 days.  
**[0:59:04-0:59:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:59:04):**  Over the last 20 some odd years. 14 days is all that we all that we're ever covered up on average during the winter. So that's all the hay that I have, I keep about two weeks of hay around to feed the cows.  And that's it.  Right, and there you go. So you have this atypical okay I can expect a snowstorm or two type of situation versus if you suddenly have snow coverage for, you know, 60 days.  
**[0:59:32-0:59:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:59:32):**  That blows you up because that's, that's, that's the atypical for you.  Yeah, if I get, you know, if I get a snowstorm that sticks around for more than more than 14 to 21 days.  Yeah, I'm probably going to have a panic.  
**[0:59:45-1:00:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=0:59:45):**  And I was sitting here thinking, one of the worst things that could happen to me right now, or anytime between now and say April 15, would be have a wildfire come through and nuke all my stockpiled grass.  There's actually that actually happened up in northern Kansas. Last year I think it was December 15 there was a wildfire burned something like a quarter million acres in a day.  And without knowing anything about you know their situation just thinking about like, okay, what would I do on December 15, if I got burned out my winter stockpile got burned out.  
**[1:00:20-1:00:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:00:20):**  I wouldn't have a choice I'd have to take everything to town, or go find another ranch for him to stand on because there's no way that I'm going to feed hay from December 15 to April 15.  So, you know, I think that's the only way to get out of your outside your mind that that's going to work. Well, I mean, that makes perfect sense I think here's another dimension to that, you know, gets to for everybody to think about their context,  that's a difference for me and why actually feeding hay makes sense. So I don't even make my own hay.  
**[1:00:47-1:01:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:00:47):**  I'm just from neighbors, because here where we are. There's a lot of properties that were farms at one point that are now owned as essentially second homes by folks in Boston and other parts of the country.  And, and typically what they need is somebody to hay their field because they want to keep the open pasture look. And so that creates a market for a couple of different farmers locally here who basically act as kind of land caretakers, they hey everybody's  fields. They now have hey to sell that's relatively cheap, you know, like, like I'm doing you know kind of a big round bale of like silage hay wrapped in plastic is like, you know, 45 bucks.  
**[1:01:28-1:02:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:01:28):**  Yeah. For what like a four by four like a eight 900 pound bale. Yeah, yeah. Okay, so, so double that for the per ton cost. Right, and so, like, it's not that bad, it's manageable, like it's still a cost it's an input cost relatively speaking,  but it's not that bad and so like I'm able to get that supplied relatively easily it's available. And, you know, it doesn't make sense for me to try to make it on my own land so number one, I don't have to, you know, give up that fertility and kind  of mind the farm. And number two, I'm able to expand my herd out and support it. If that market were to change and suddenly that's not available anymore. I would need to rethink my strategy, but given the context of what I'm in right now.  
**[1:02:15-1:02:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:02:15):**  That also makes it very feasible to feed that hey, so what, what, let's talk a little bit about hey because you kind of opened the door for me to say something.  So, if we talk about buying hey, just for the, just for the forage value that the hey represents.  That's one thing. If we're buying hey, to use, if we're buying hey and we're thinking about it is, I'm importing this fertility to my farm, and you're using that hey, not only to to feed animals but you're also using that hey, you know, with some other  
**[1:02:52-1:03:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:02:52):**  function to boost soil structure or feed the soil or build build soil organic matter, or you're unrolling that hey on a bear spot to provide soil armor so maybe some other plants will come in and have an opportunity to take root.  Those have a far different value attached to them, than just buying that bale for the forage value it represents to feed to an animal. 100% agree so I probably should have said this sooner right but what I do with all my winter manure is, I mean, use a little  bit of our kitchen garden, but the vast majority of it gets put back out onto our trees. So back to that point of I have about 700 trees chestnut mulberry Apple black locust some walnut.  
**[1:03:37-1:04:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:03:37):**  Some elderberry like basically kind of all these trees and shrubs that we've been growing, you know, I use that as fertilizer, that's basically what I'm using that hey and the manure for. And so, yeah, that that saves me an input costs on that side of the  business as well and so you know back to that point of hey I see myself as an ecosystem manager.  That's just another level of management so yeah I do have that benefit.  
**[1:04:02-1:04:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:04:02):**  The top of our pasture was used you know so we are originally a dairy farm. But then, you know, from about 2000 to 2010, it was an organic vegetable farm.  And then, you know, they were, they were basically doing row organic vegetables up top, but never really reseeded anything, then it sat abandoned for about six, seven years before we took it over.  And so, you know, basically re conditioning and rebuilding that top pasture has been something I've had to do too. And to your point, you know, essentially doing kind of rolled out bales has been a nice way to like help improve some of that area as well.  
**[1:04:39-1:05:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:04:39):**  And I think that's, you know, that's really under looked, because I feel like I feel like a lot of guys get siloed into, you know, when they're feeding hey, they just go feed it in the ring feeder put it, you know, put it in the bunker or whatever and it's, it's being  in the same spot. And, you know, I, I always try to go to somewhere different when I'm unrolling a bale, like when I'm unrolling a bale of supplemental alfalfa to supplement my protein ration.  Like I said, I'm looking for those bare spots, you know, those bare thin spots, maybe I'm looking for a patch of really, really tall rank big bluestem that's seven feet tall that the cows haven't been in four years.  
**[1:05:21-1:06:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:05:21):**  Maybe the thing to do there is to roll the bale through it and let them just pound that grass that they're not going to eat anyway, let them pound it into dirt, open up the canopy so something else can come in.  But adding, you know, when you feed that bale, whether you unroll it or you feed it in a ring feeder or, you know, whatever scheme you want to use, you can use that as a tool to concentrate your animals in an area.  And you can take advantage of that herd effect to do different things to, you know, use all those hooves in an area to break down some brush that concentrated manure and urine to add fertility back, you know, some of the quote waste hay that's on the ground.  
**[1:06:02-1:06:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:06:02):**  Well, if it gets pounded in the ground to feed soil microbes, is it waste?  No, I think that that's exactly right and, you know, one of the things so you know cattle have been the newest animal that I added to my farm.  It won't be the last animal that I add to my farm. But one of the things I wonder is, are cattle going to be truly an anchor animal on the farm where it's like, you know, I ultimately want to expand out to say probably could on this property support  
**[1:06:30-1:07:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:06:30):**  if he had a cattle and be able to do that, or, and are they just going to be kind of an element because of what they can do with their heavy hoof disruption.  And I should maybe be thinking about other things like sheep because, you know, and this gets back to the business case right you know while sheep have, you know, worst parasite problems, and the efficiency of butchering a sheep and like what you get versus  the cost of butchering sucks. There is this advantage of if I can harvest my lambs in like say late October. Um, you know, I'm not having to pay, you know, do the whole 18 month cycle that I typically have to do with the steer here, which is going  
**[1:07:08-1:07:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:07:08):**  to save me money which is maybe a better why I mean, part of why I went with a smaller breed of cattle like the Scottish Highland versus say, you know, like, Charlotte or belt a Galloway or something like that like a bigger animal is just because then I'd  be two years in and then I'm feeding two years of hey, that just seems crazy to me if I'm going to make the business case for a steer work.  And so, I go into all of this and saying, you know, kind of thinking about those costs and those benefits and how they fit with other things is a big part of how I'm constantly evaluating the farm and saying how many animals do I want to have.  
**[1:07:41-1:07:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:07:41):**  And to your point that qualitative ecological impact of cattle and what they can do for the land. I think I'm always going to have cattle just because of that reason.  Yeah, and I can see that.  And I was just thinking that, you know, where you're at.  
**[1:07:58-1:08:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:07:58):**  It's probably a very similar environment to the Scottish Highlands like climate wise forage wise.  It's probably, you know, on order of 80% similarities.  Yeah, I think we get a little bit colder but for the most part, yeah, it's, they were hill farms and were hill farms it's it's small tight parcels of land intermix with a lot of forest, you know, lots of steep, you know, kind of uneven pasture, very much is what we have here too.  
**[1:08:27-1:09:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:08:27):**  I don't like why I have Korean ace because that's an animal that that should be able to succeed on, you know, in a dry hot environment on poor forage, you know, Scottish Highlander, it should work well for you.  I mean, I mean it's it's exactly like I mean to back where I said I don't think I'd ever want to have them appear, much like I look at people like out and say like southern Oklahoma who have Scottish Highlands and it's like, yeah, I guess you can do it out there  but like the best, you know, animal for that context like, I don't know, I think sometimes, you know, that's really something people should think more about.  
**[1:09:01-1:09:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:09:01):**  You won't see somebody with 30 Scottish Highlanders out here, you'll see somebody with three, because their pets because the wife wanted them or the girlfriend thought they were cute.  That's generally why you'll see Highlanders out here.  They are the most memorable cattle I'll give it that, like you know they are cool looking I mean, that's the added benefit but you know, depending on your climate they might not be the best option either.  
**[1:09:21-1:09:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:09:21):**  I actually had a friend that had a few he was a he was a cow trader had a ranch down the road from he had a sellout move few years ago.  And his wife she was a really neat lady, and the one time he took her to the cattle sale, they came home with three Highlanders, and they lived in the wheat pasture, right by the house.  So, so mama could go out and have her coffee and she could look at her Highlander or three Highlander steers. And it was really funny because Ed and their oldest daughter.  
**[1:09:48-1:10:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:09:48):**  Grace kept threatening.  They kept threatening to turn them into a pair of Woolies.  Yeah, no, you know, here's actually one of the things I struggle with too and and again this is by virtue of being kind of very public farm on the internet, where I keep looking at what the sale costs of our four steers and bull calves that are highlands and recognize  
**[1:10:12-1:10:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:10:12):**  that I probably could even add a little bit of, hey look, these are semi famous cows so they can get like a little premium.  It actually makes it hard to want to raise beef because what that cattle market looks like right now. I know that cattle markets are cycles and I know that we are on the upswing of a cycle right now, particularly for Highlands, but it does make me  feel like, you know, how do you balance creating food which I really do genuinely want to be an objective of my farm versus driving the most economic impact and sometimes those are not the same thing.  
**[1:10:46-1:10:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:10:46):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I can see that with the cattle market and I think that  
**[1:10:54-1:11:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:10:54):**  I'm going to go ahead and throw this out there and I'll go ahead and say this on the podcast. I think that over the next 18 months. I think the high input high octane genetics that take a lot of a lot of grain inputs to succeed.  I think we're going to start seeing those fall out of favor as input costs and diesel fuel prices continue to rise and and cattle like yours and cattle like mine that are being developed on grass and that are being pushed on grass.  I hope they're going to be more valuable in the future than they are currently.  
**[1:11:25-1:11:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:11:25):**  Yeah, no, I think the yeah call it.  Hobbes says low input ranching or something like collapse ranching I think yeah yeah.  Yeah, like it's I think it's something along those lines I think is going to be the case. One of the things I'm exploring to like.  
**[1:11:43-1:12:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:11:43):**  I haven't talked about this much but I think you'll actually appreciate this. So I am getting a couple of charlay cattle from a farm on the other side of a hill, basically, the the guy's been raising them there for 30 plus years and just, he's got  animals perfectly suited for his land which is pretty much exactly like my land. I also have a Highland bowl coming and so my plan is going to be trying to do charlay Highland hybrids with the, you know, mothers being charlay so you don't have any cattle  charlay so you don't have any calving issues.  
**[1:12:15-1:12:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:12:15):**  You know, because you got the smaller Highland bowl father. Right. And I'm curious to see how those animals perform because, you know, I think, you know, oftentimes we get fixated on the pure breed when probably that hybrid that has kind of just the right elements  of mom and just the right elements of dad for your land might be the best option to your point of the low input, you know, suited for the land type of farming that I think is going to need to happen over the next decade or so.  I definitely think there's a huge value in hybrid vigor and heterosis, you know from different breeds.  
**[1:12:52-1:13:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:12:52):**  You know, you can take, you can take a hybrid like that and you know I like charlays hybrid don't get me wrong so I'm not going to say anything bad about them I got friends that raise them.  Charley on Corriente.  There's people doing maternal cross, doing that maternal cross.  
**[1:13:12-1:13:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:13:12):**  I haven't really, I haven't really unpacked any of that yet.  Most people that are do Corriente and Charley are doing that for terminal animal. And, you know, I get the whole calving ease, calving ease question.  This isn't something I personally done. Now, you know, we know our friend Hobbs fire and salt.  
**[1:13:32-1:13:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:13:32):**  He had some, he had to pull some calves out of Charley bulls and Coriante cows.  Anecdotally, I know some other folks that have used. I know a guy that used Charley bulls on Coriante cows for years, and he never pulled a single thing.  So maybe that's, you know, and I think that's kind of subjective that's going depends on the cows you have depends on the bulls you have.  
**[1:13:56-1:14:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:13:56):**  But more to the point.  There's a lot of value in the hybrid vigor vigor and the heterosis, you know, even a lot of quote Angus steers that go to the feedlot.  You know, they're half or three quarters Angus, you know, they're they've got some Hereford in them or some other kind of continental in them or some other English in them, because that's what happened to fit that, you know, that particular ranchers context.  
**[1:14:19-1:14:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:14:19):**  And even we can think about breeds like beef master.  We can think about a breed like the South Pole. We can even think about the center, Saniger, Trudis cattle.  All three of those. They're all hybrid breeds that are composites that were made from four other different breeds. Right. And why were they made from four different breeds, because there wasn't a single breed that fit the context of what those cattle  
**[1:14:45-1:15:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:14:45):**  needed, so they made their own.  Yeah, well, I think it's one of those interesting things right because I mean isn't that essentially the definition of a land race breed right where it's, it's like, you know, you're essentially raising something suited for the context that you're in.  You know, I wonder if that's actually going to become bigger and bigger, because, you know, as you know, more people, maybe try to shy away from the sale barn model and go more direct to consumer, you start to find that benefit that comes there as well in terms  
**[1:15:18-1:15:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:15:18):**  of, you know, raising animals from your land suited for your land to be sold from your land kind of like sort of that full kind of complete circle.  And I'll make the comment right now and go ahead and email me at redhillsrancher.com all your hate comments. Angus cows will succeed anywhere, because we have access to cheap feed and cheap diesel fuel.  And, you know, it worked when diesel was three bucks. It worked when hay was under $100 a ton. It works when cubes are $200 a ton.  
**[1:15:52-1:16:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:15:52):**  But when we're looking at $300 hay and $400 cubes, and, you know, fat cattle are $1.75. It doesn't work, you know, $9 corn.  It doesn't work.  Yeah, so, I mean, around here so the majority of the farms that are still operating around me now are conventional dairy, where the model is basically they're growing corn, setting that aside, feeding that in the winter.  
**[1:16:23-1:17:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:16:23):**  Also maybe some silage. And that's how they're doing it with the big Holstein cows like that's the majority of the farms around me.  But I'm starting to see more and more shifting either going to specialty milk and probably shifting to like either brown Swiss or a jersey, or they're going to just get out of the dairy business altogether because they can't make it work economically.  I don't think beef is that far behind that shift, but that shift is happening especially around here in dairy as we speak, and I think in a decade from now, the amount of dairies in my area will maybe be cut in half.  
**[1:17:02-1:17:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:17:02):**  That's scary. Yeah, that's scary as hell.  And you're right.  You know, the sale barns exist for a reason, just like grain elevators exist for a reason. Are you familiar with grain elevators, grain marketing co-op?  
**[1:17:19-1:17:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:17:19):**  You know, they're great.  But say, like a local farmers co-op, they might only have six different crops that they will accept.  So, you know, if you got a 3000 acre farm, you're trying to make machinery payments and get operating loans that you need to have crop insurance for, you know, that even narrows your list of crops down so much more of what you can get insurance on because if you have a loan, you got to have insurance to be able to pay the loan, right?  
**[1:17:48-1:18:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:17:48):**  So guys will get siloed in like, well, all I can grow here is wheat. I can grow, you know, I can grow wheat, I can grow milo, I can grow, you know, maybe one or two other things that the co-op might accept.  But everybody around here grows wheat. So that's just what we're going to do. Or, you know, everybody around here has black cows. Well, where do you sell them? How we take them to the sale barn?  And it circles back to some of the conversation we had earlier, right? We give up our market power far too easily.  
**[1:18:17-1:18:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:18:17):**  We don't want to deal with customers because that's honestly that's why most of us get into this line of work is because we're tired of dealing with people. We want to get out of the country where there aren't a bunch of people.  So we won't have to deal with them all the time. Right? And then we get, you know, a year or two down these livestock operations go well, shit, if I actually want to make this work, I can't just take them to the commodity barn and sell them at the commodity barn because I'm going to end up like everybody else.  I'm going to end up broke and poor and going out of business and not knowing why. We got to do something different. And that difference is we have to have we have to connect more directly with our customers.  
**[1:18:54-1:19:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:18:54):**  I think it goes, it's going to go in two directions. It's going to go exactly like what you're talking about exactly what you're doing, what I'm doing, what a lot of other folks are doing, where it's figuring out a business model that's direct to consumer.  And it's going to go to bigger and bigger scalable factory farm shops. And I think the middle of the road producer is going to be the one that actually really struggles to kind of figure out a way to make it work. Because I think, you know, kind of selling  Those are the dairy farms that I saw going out of business in your little story. It's not the big ones, because the big ones are just going to get bigger. They probably already sell to a co-op with a good marketing arrangement. And yeah, they might be on a razor thin profit margin, but their scale makes it workable. Then you get to the midsize guy that's operating on the same margin selling to the same people, his costs go up by one or 2%. And that destroys the profit margin, then what do you have you have dairies going out of business, the small ones are going to be the same.  
**[1:19:52-1:20:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:19:52):**  The small ones that are light and flexible enough to do things like direct to consumer raw milk sales and you don't bring in, sell off half the cows, bring in a bunch of chickens, you know, for eggs and chicken meat as another byline.  Yeah, you're exactly right. That's, you know, one of my neighbors who is a what I'll call a midsize right where you have like 300 milk cows, which, you know, for around here that's like a midsize operation that like he was finding that, you know, particularly right around COVID he was now having to pay money to produce milk.  And it's like, okay, this doesn't make sense. Time to change the business model and he actually was super smart because he shifted their model towards actually producing heifers and raising heifers that gets sold to the big guys, but like his whole his  
**[1:20:43-1:20:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:20:43):**  economics of his business now are very different.  But being able to make that shift was necessary or else that farm would have gone belly up.  I just think what I what I see is the saddest thing is like I have another neighbor.  
**[1:20:57-1:21:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:20:57):**  You know he's a believe third generation maybe even further back third generation dairy farmer in the same plot of land. And all he wants to do is raise his cows and milk his cows and call it a day.  Yet he's also in that small I think 250 head of cattle or 250 milk cows kind of size operation that just, it's it's going to get harder and harder to keep that afloat.  And unless he's willing to adapt that decisions going to get made for him.  
**[1:21:25-1:21:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:21:25):**  Yep. And let me guess he's probably running big giant Holstein cows.  And I think that's, you know, there's problems with the Holsteins.  Like there's there's genetic problems with the Holsteins I think something like 40% of Holstein cows can trace their lineage back to one bull.  
**[1:21:45-1:22:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:21:45):**  And I think that there's, you know, if you really get down to it, there's two bulls that are 60 to 70%, you know, common parentage with with all the Holstein cows running around.  And again, my opinion. So we've got some we've got some maybe some inbreeding happening in the in the dairy Holstein population at large, not not pointing out anybody specific.  And it's because they've got to chase that production number, right? It's how efficient is this cow produced at turning, you know, this high energy feed that we're putting into it?  
**[1:22:19-1:22:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:22:19):**  How much milk is she going to produce on that? And yeah, yeah, there's Holstein cows that'll make 100 pounds of milk a day, which is just absolutely phenomenal.  But what have we sacrificed to get that giant amount of production? Did we screw up the lactose? Like have we have we changed lactose?  Is there less percentage of milk fat in the milk and is it more watery? You know, what are we sacrificing?  
**[1:22:43-1:23:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:22:43):**  What are your input costs on that cow? I mean, like you're probably feeding a whole heck of a lot of corn to keep that animal running through the dead of winter. Like it's all that sort of stuff.  Yeah, like, okay, let's feed an 1800 pound Holstein because she's going to make 100 pounds of milk versus feeding two 600 pound jerseys that are each going to make 35.  And I think the guys that are, you know, that are locked into that huge production mindset that are still mid-size that have never been able to scale, you know, scale up to one of the big scale up to a big producer and you know, kind of break over.  
**[1:23:20-1:23:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:23:20):**  I think you're right. They're the ones that are they're the ones that are the extreme danger of going out. If they don't change something.  You know, you brought up imposter syndrome too earlier, right? And I think that one of the absolute blessings I feel like I have, despite the fact that I sure do have that imposter syndrome and you know, people can still question, are you really a farmer and all that nonsense?  I don't have the legacy and baggage of, well, this is how my dad did it. This is how my granddad did it. And because I'm a first generation farmer, I'm looking at it with fresh eyes and I have, like, say, a business background that gives me a different way of thinking about how to  
**[1:23:56-1:24:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:23:56):**  start and run a business that I see as an advantage for me, even though it comes with its own disadvantages. I think it's a challenge when you're multi generation and you're trying to keep that same model going.  It's so much harder to slaughter that sacred cow and shift the business model from what it was 30, 40, 60 years ago.  Yeah. Yeah.  
**[1:24:22-1:25:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:24:22):**  So, as a first generation, you get to make all your own mistakes, right? You have the opportunity to make all the mistakes. So, you probably have a neighbor, you said he had a neighbor that's third, fourth generation.  Grandpa already made those mistakes and told him about it. So, he's like got a mental block.  Like, I think when guys are multi-generational operation or, you know, an operation that has a long history like that, a guy will get siloed in thinking, well, that's never worked here, so I'm just not going to try it and have a mental block that they don't even know they have against trying a new practice.  
**[1:25:03-1:25:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:25:03):**  So, completely, but I think there's a balance that needs to be struck too. So, I have one neighbor right across the street over there. He's like in his 80s and he has been farming the land across the street from me since the 50s.  He's a source of information. I have another neighbor I share a back property line who has been there since the, I think, mid 60s.  I have a couple of others who are down the road who have been doing it around this area their entire lives. And so, to be able to talk to those people and to learn from those people and get advice from those people, while I'm a new guy coming in and being a first  
**[1:25:40-1:26:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:25:40):**  generation farmer is important and useful, but I don't feel like it carries maybe the same baggage as say if I were to call my dad and ask him what to do with the same plot of land that he was using, because to your point it's like you get locked in and so  I think you, if you're not relying on your neighbors and you're not relying on what's been done in the past and what's happened in the past. I think you're ignoring an important piece of information.  But at the same time if you're putting too much stock into it, and you're letting that guide all of your decisions, I think that's going to steer you wrong too. It's, it's just a delicate balance that you think you ultimately need to strike there.  
**[1:26:16-1:26:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:26:16):**  Yeah, it is, and  staying open minded is a large part of it. Staying open minded to new ideas, staying open minded, not just new ideas but also to maybe some of those hard conversations, hard probing questions that, that maybe somebody in the business that's been in the business for 30 years  is afraid to ask themselves.  
**[1:26:42-1:27:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:26:42):**  You know that that's something that's kind of, I was sitting here thinking, like, you don't have any education at all in ag, and you're out there, killing it.  So, I'm doing okay. I mean, killing it feels very strong. You're doing okay.  You're not outwardly struggling as much as a lot of other guys probably are. And I appreciate that. And I think that there's a value in not having a traditional ag background.  
**[1:27:15-1:27:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:27:15):**  Because you haven't been educated, you haven't been told your whole life and in university about what doesn't work.  You have to figure that out on your own. And so tell me how you've done that. Like, let's talk about, you talked about some of your local mentors, let's talk about maybe some that aren't quite so local and some resources that you've used to, to build the foundation  that you have in your head to run your farm.  
**[1:27:42-1:28:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:27:42):**  Yeah, I mean, it's been a combination of things. I mean, yeah, my neighbors are important sources of information.  When I was first getting started, I think I mentioned this earlier, right, it was reading books by guys like Mark Shepherd and Joel Salatin and Gabe Brown and like folks like that, kind of seeing some of the things that they talk about and letting that kind  of shaped my view. I think it was going out and visiting farms when I was just curious about farms back in the day, and talking to folks who aren't of a, call it like a Joel Salatin celebrity status right and are just some dudes  
**[1:28:18-1:28:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:28:18):**  raising goats in, you know, rural Virginia, like, you know, kind of spending time with those folks and seeing kind of how that works. I think that's part of it.  And this is a big part of why I went to YouTube right YouTube videos are tremendous. And yes, they're packaged and yes, you can't believe everything you see and yes you got to take some of it with a grain of salt, but it's also particularly for me  like where I'm a very visual learner. It's such a great source of information you know, you know, I think back to like 2015 or so and, you know, kind of dreaming of starting a farm and thinking about what I want to do, watching people like Greg  
**[1:28:56-1:29:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:28:56):**  Judy, and seeing what he's doing on his YouTube channel was maybe some of the most influential stuff for me and and and and so, like, that's why when I think back on kind of the information it's a mix of those things.  I think the one caution I throw out there to folks though is recognizing that that's a good inspiration and that's a good base of knowledge, but until you start doing it, it's different.  And like, you can read every book you could ever imagine you can listen to every ranching podcast like I'm hoping there's somebody commuting to their office job right now listening to this very podcast dreaming of starting a farm and they hear me say  
**[1:29:37-1:30:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:29:37):**  that yes you can use this as information, but take everything you hear with a grain of salt, what's going to work for your context and work for you is going to be different.  And until you actually get out there and try some stuff and have some of it work and have some of it and fail. That is going to be the real way that you learn and if I was going to actually point to who's my biggest mentor, it's absolutely been failure,  failure is like the most powerful mentor you can have, because you get to see things and observe things and get to know something in your bones that you've never been able to do until you've actually failed and so it's it's a collage of all those things  
**[1:30:17-1:30:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:30:17):**  working together.  So let's talk about failing at scale and the scale of failure.  I've never failed at scale. I mean, that's the thing. Well, you have failed at scale we've all failed at scale. And sometimes the failure is, is we didn't scale everything up enough fast enough.  
**[1:30:38-1:31:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:30:38):**  And sometimes, sometimes I think it's important to be able to find a scale that you can fail at and be willing to fail.  Okay, I see what you're saying. So yes, all right, then I've failed at scale plenty of times I guess my point is this, what I have emphasized has been always to fail small.  Yes, and where if I fail it's 40 ducks okay it's 40 ducks it's 2000 bucks.  
**[1:31:07-1:31:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:31:07):**  Big deal, I'll get past it.  When I started with the cattle right I added six animals last October, I'm going to add a few more where I'm basically going to be doubled over the course of this winter, and I'm going to continue to keep trying to expand and double over the next couple  of years. And that's because I feel confident now to have 12 animals when I was barely confident to have three 12 months ago, and it's it's being willing to do some things struggle at a small scale, so that you can get bigger so that you can scale  
**[1:31:42-1:32:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:31:42):**  it's that's typically how I'm thinking about it. Yeah, make.  I'm thinking about it like in the sense of somebody, you know, it's got a multi thousand acre commodity farm. I had a friend. He told me this a couple months ago, he had a big drill skip in the middle of the one of his corn pivots.  It was like 20 feet wide or whatever, however many 16 roses. And he thought, well, I'll just go throw a couple pumpkin seeds out there so he's like through, maybe it was watermelon like two seeds out there.  
**[1:32:13-1:32:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:32:13):**  And this whole area. By the end of the season was completely covered from two seeds. So he said, I'm just going to go ahead we're going to take that to the next level next year.  I'm going to make an intentional drill skip in the middle of one of my pivots right off the pivot road. And I'm gonna plant my vegetable garden in there.  Well, that makes sense. I also want to say, I don't know how many days of water this guy has, but he was telling me that he was putting like an inch and a half of water on the whole pivot every three days.  
**[1:32:44-1:33:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:32:44):**  So yeah, I mean if you're getting three inches of water twice a week, anything's gonna grow.  You're gonna grow anything.  Well, but honestly though those mistakes are those little offshoots, you know, I found, you know, fertilized eggs is an example of that for me. Another biggie is tree seedlings.  
**[1:33:02-1:33:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:33:02):**  So every year I sprout thousands of tree seedlings. It started as a way for me to replace the seedlings that died in my orchard. And you know just basically backfill it okay oh I need a new chestnut tree well rather than pay you know seven bucks or 10 bucks a seedling,  let me just, you know sprouted myself they're pretty easy to sprout once you learn how to do it.  Now, I've probably sprout 2000 chestnut trees this year. And basically from from chestnuts from chestnuts so I basically I have a system where I take chestnuts, I bury them in a bucket with wet sand, bury them underground sprout all of them, and then I pull them up in the  
**[1:33:43-1:34:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:33:43):**  spring and put them in beds, and then let them grow up as bare root tree seedlings, and then I sell those tree seedlings they're they're going to be selling for between seven and $10 per seedling this this in like November, late October, November.  And so that's a business that I never planned on being in, but over the span of, I don't know, 30 hours of work each year.  And so I was able to like add thousands of dollars to the farm's bottom line, and is relatively low risk. That was never something that I planned on doing or thought I'd be doing, but I just happened to have a bunch of extra and so I sold them to somebody  
**[1:34:19-1:34:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:34:19):**  who wanted to, you know, add chestnuts to his, you know pasture so you can attract more deer for hunting season and it's like, okay, that's a market. Okay, let me see how I build on that market.  And, you know, it gets back to kind of almost where we started this conversation of if you see and identify a market and can fill that niche, your production part, it becomes the easiest hurdle to overcome.  It's much more, will there be people who will pay you enough money to make this profitable to do. That's the important question to ask yourself that's the thing that you want to be looking for those markets and building in on those opportunities.  
**[1:34:54-1:35:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:34:54):**  And, like, just a quick, quick and dirty analogy, like, you may need to take 100 cows to the sale barn every year in order to be profitable in the cow calf business from a quote conventional mindset. Right.  But if you have, if you're going direct to consumer, maybe you can get that same sort of income on a quarter of the land base, moving 10 animals a year.  Yes, I mean look, I'll go back to this tree example that I'm just using right now. So, in terms of land usage, it's about a quarter of an acre, maybe a little bit more maybe almost a little almost a half.  
**[1:35:32-1:35:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:35:32):**  So, not a lot of land.  It's from a time perspective I'm logging my hours it's going to end up being 30 to 35 hours by the time I have all the trees boxed up and shipped.  And in terms of input costs, I'm looking at.  
**[1:35:48-1:36:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:35:48):**  I'm going to say it's about 1500 bucks in input costs for the year.  And I will expect to have about $6,000 in net profit from all this activity unless something catastrophic happens in the next, you know, 60 days.  35 hours a week. That's my point it's like in what I'm finding is and it requires a little bit of hustle, but if I can stack enough activities of my farm in a manner like that.  
**[1:36:17-1:36:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:36:17):**  That's how it becomes a viable farm to run. And I'm not losing money.  I'm, I'm, you know, reliably creating profit I'm expanding year over year. I'm sold out of trees again this year I should, my biggest mistake is I should have planted probably another 50% than what I did.  That, that to me makes sense and so it's how do you keep doing those sorts of things. That's the opportunity I see.  
**[1:36:43-1:36:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:36:43):**  Okay.  I want to talk a little bit about your, about your trees.  So you said.  
**[1:36:51-1:37:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:36:51):**  Let's see you said chestnuts you said walnuts you said, apple.  Primarily chestnut mulberry, black locust and apple those are the four big main ones that I do I got other things like walnut and butternut that I dabble with but it's those four.  Okay, so those aren't necessarily crop trees are things that people are going to be eating me. Yeah, I apples of course walnuts. Yeah, but walnut harvesting is is not really a hand type operation anymore from what I understand and I don't really know of anybody  
**[1:37:20-1:38:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:37:20):**  that eats chestnuts anymore so it sounds like you're growing a lot of chestnut trees for people to plant for deer habitat which totally get. No, no, no so chestnuts are primarily I see them actually as an eating thing.  Look, we could go into a whole jaunt on the history of the American chestnut tree and the tragedy that happened in the early part of the 20th century that basically wiped out what was one of the predominant tree crops of the eastern United States, and like  it went away in about 50 years but but the reality is, I think that they are coming back. I raised Chinese American hybrid chestnuts which are, for the most part would have found to be blight resistant and and they can be provided as food for people,  
**[1:38:09-1:38:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:38:09):**  they can be provided as food for potentially livestock, and also food for wildlife, and what I've been trying to do is, you know, grow them one because I think they're just good for the land to for the wildlife and see if I can ultimately and I haven't  had a lot of production yet but I'm only at year five so I'm not expecting much for actually another two years.  So if I get production out of those trees that could be either something I sell as a mail order thing I could be selling it for seed given how my, you know, kind of tree nursery business is kind of taken off as a little side hustle.  
**[1:38:45-1:39:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:38:45):**  You know so there's ways that you could do there. I could run pigs through part of my pasture and have them essentially have it be like a tool for finishing pork.  And so it just gives me a lot of flexibility. It's similar like why I'm into mulberry like mulberry is another one that people like wait what were yes you can eat mulberry yes you can harvest mulberry you can do a lot of things with it you can make  wine with mulberry.  
**[1:39:10-1:39:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:39:10):**  But it's also great for the birds. And so just having that there.  Also it's, it could be potentially great for the geese I mean, one of the things I'm going to try to experiment with is can I actually fatten geese on chestnuts and mulberries. And so do Am I able to actually even get into the realm of ethical foie gras, if I could  go that route. I don't know these things yet but you know trees take a long time to grow. And so your biggest casualty when it comes to trees is time. And so I was much more about, let's get these things in the ground and get them going.  
**[1:39:43-1:40:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:39:43):**  And see what they produce and see what I can do with them, versus hemming and hawing and hoping I ultimately have the perfect use case for these trees. I mean, you know the fact that I grew white mulberry right.  One of the things I think about is, do I actually harvest.  Essentially, like a fodder system for my cattle, where I'm actually feeding them stockpile mulberry branches in the winter months as well as a way to augment because mulberries, I think it's it's white mulberry I think has like protein levels similar to  
**[1:40:14-1:40:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:40:14):**  the alpha. And so, like is that a way to augment my hay and augment my cattle, while just simply basically pruning my orchard too so it's that sort of stuff and so it's one of those things where the true use like the business use is the least developed.  It was also the first thing I ever did. And I see just a lot of potential for ways that I can go with it in the future. And it also has the longest payoff of probably anything.  I mean there's a there's a guy who made a video on the internet and so it's a video on the internet so take what stock you will with it but he did a pretty good job of making the business case that the lifetime value of a chestnut tree is about  
**[1:40:52-1:41:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:40:52):**  $50,000, which so you get a couple hundred of those going and hey look I got my, you know, retirement plan right there in the past year.  We have, we don't have white mulberries here we have black mulberries. And the road actually the county road actually live on is called Mulberry Creek Road.  And there's a, there's a mulberry tree about 120 yards west of my back porch. That's been there for longer than I can remember because I grew up in this house that I'm living in now, and that mulberry tree has always been there.  
**[1:41:31-1:41:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:41:31):**  Last time we went out to try to get some mulberries off of it.  Last July, it was July of 21. We went out with a big tarp, you know, and a shaker stick to try to you don't get your shake them off the branches because the way they mature here.  You know, the whole tree doesn't just suddenly turn at one time I mean you'll have half of them green half of them turn, and the other half are already laying on the ground.  
**[1:41:57-1:42:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:41:57):**  And, you know, they're deer love them like there's a deer highway going to that tree and man they like when those mulberries are dropping.  They'll go out there and they'll clean that thing up every day. There's a browse line about eight feet tall on the tree where there isn't a branch, because that's how high the deer can get when they stand on their back legs.  But when we went out there with tarp, because we're going to try to harvest some mulberries, we went out there laid the tarp down on the ground, got the pole. And before we started shaking the branch looked up and the whole dang tree was full of hornets and wasps.  
**[1:42:32-1:42:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:42:32):**  So we gently folded the tarp back up and walked back to the house.  Yeah, this is this is we're not doing this today, not without bee suits.  Yeah, no, I mean, obviously you always have those risks.  
**[1:42:47-1:43:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:42:47):**  But yeah, so I mean, the orchard I have it's one of those things where like I over planted it for example to right. So, you know, a lot of these trees have like recommended spacings of like 20 or 30 feet.  And I've planted stuff every 10 feet. And it's again because I'd rather expend a couple extra bucks on a bare root seedling and let it grow for five years and then decide oh I don't want this one, and then just cut it down versus, you know, have you know  something, a hole and something dies because they do die, and suddenly like say gosh I wish I had five years back to start another tree like you never get that time back and so you know over planting, maybe not having the greatest plan I think are all mistakes  
**[1:43:28-1:43:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:43:28):**  you can make that are going to be your benefit when you're working with trees.  I've seen it said several places, the best time to plant a tree was yesterday.  And the second best time is today so there you go.  
**[1:43:45-1:43:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:43:45):**  We've been going for a while.  But ready to get out of here. Where can we find you on social media.  Sure. If you're looking for us it's a gold Shaw farm.  
**[1:43:55-1:44:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:43:55):**  It's called GOL DSH AW.  Very cool, very cool.  So, a couple of things I want to talk to you about.  
**[1:44:27-1:44:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:44:27):**  Solar farm.  Let's talk about solar farm maybe going in and what your plan is for that.  Well, so, and I put out a video I think was last summer, talking about some plans around potentially trying to put solar infrastructure in where I graze some of my cattle, right, as a way to, again, try to get multiple uses out of a single piece of land.  
**[1:44:52-1:45:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:44:52):**  What I've found is I tried to price it out and I actually by putting that video out a lot of like experts came to me and gave me some great information.  The cost for creating solar infrastructure that will not get damaged by the cattle is so high that it immediately blows up the business case for actually trying to do that solar field and so I'm kind of given up on that.  What I have done though in the past year is me and some of my neighbors we actually formed solar co op.  
**[1:45:23-1:46:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:45:23):**  So, so essentially creating some, you know, some areas where there are solar panels and they're kind of well spread out where potentially we could be grazing some sheep in there.  And so that might be something that happens in the future. The sheep are just a lot less. They don't run on destructive. Yeah, I mean, the rub but it's not going to do nearly the damages as a, you know, thousand pound highland steerable like will do and that's, that's the difference.  And so, 200 pound, you know, Ram lamb or Ram is not going to tear up near what 1000 pound or in Korean to your highlander well. Yeah, no.  
**[1:46:00-1:46:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:46:00):**  So, which is why as I continue to explore Do I ever potentially get into sheep, that's like another argument for it because again, I do believe in this premise of what fossil fuel availability is going to change whether we like it or not.  And so finding alternatives to that is going to be important, and folks who can offer solutions to the kind of broader communities that they're in around that, I think are going to benefit and so that's why I pretty regularly kind of try to explore ideas  like this it's not to say that our electric infrastructure or solar is like the perfect solution because I think it's actually far from it. It just, I also just believe that, you know, the way that we have used fossil fuels for the last 6075 years, it's just  
**[1:46:45-1:47:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:46:45):**  not going to be that way and so we need an alternative fossil fuel use has been completely irresponsible I mean there's some things we should that that we're going to have to continue to use it for, but there's some other uses.  That we're going to have to curtail and quickly, if we want to be able to use these fuels in farther into the future, you know, for the things that they make sense for, you know, I, I get the whole electric car argument.  Okay, we all need to drive electric cars. Fine.  
**[1:47:15-1:47:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:47:15):**  Where's the electric excavator, the electric haul truck, that's going to mind that shit.  I, you know, I mean, no, I think you're right. I, here's the thing though, and and we've added some electric infrastructure to the farm in the last year where it's like our mower is now electric, and you know we have, you know, a car that's now electric.  I still look out, say 510 years from now, is there going to be a mid sized tractor that could be electric. Um, I think that that's going to be reasonable I think you're right though, the super heavy duty stuff.  
**[1:47:52-1:48:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:47:52):**  It's still going to be a decade to three decades out before that, that could ever potentially work, but you know to kind of keep fossil fuel fuel availability for something like that makes a lot more sense then you know me driving to the post office after this call  like, you know, like, there's some things that work for that versus not and so how do you have a situation where you have the supply of electricity that is, you know, not going to be destructive in its own creation right.  That is the thing I think we need to be thinking about because yeah to fire turbines, you know or fire fire some sort of generator system using fossil fuels just seems silly to me, versus when you really need it in some sort of mobile and power based form,  
**[1:48:32-1:49:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:48:32):**  let's save it for that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, because there's there's nothing as energy dense as fossil fuels I think even the best batteries are still 10 times less energy dense than a gallon of gasoline I think maybe it might even approach 100 times less dense.  Yeah, and gosh I feel like I saw a video of a guy talking about, like kind of this debate, and how, when you start to look at though the efficiency of a combustion engine, you know, that energy contained in that gasoline even that kind of falls out the window  quick when you think about, you know, internal combustion engines and how how efficient they are. Yeah, how much you know how much thermal energy we're going to lose how much you know noise energy we're going to lose.  
**[1:49:14-1:50:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:49:14):**  Oh yeah, it's, they're not efficient at all. And, you know, at the same time we're trying to, we're trying to, you know, use less fossil fuel we need to use the fossil fuels we use need to be used more intelligently and far more efficiently.  Yeah, it's, it's going to be interesting as we move forward in the future what's going to happen economically with, you know, cost of transportation cost of inputs, and just the cost to get our products to market in front of our consumers.  Yeah. Oh, so I was actually just down last week in New York, YouTube of all people brought me down to New York to like, they were kind of hosting a climate summit and I went to a couple of other things because it was like all UN week going on down there  
**[1:50:03-1:50:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:50:03):**  last week, and when you start to have conversations with folks who are completely removed from agriculture right and how they're seeing kind of what the solution set needs to look like as well as the needs of the future.  I think it's very different than what somebody like you or me or somebody even listening to this podcast would believe. And yet at the same time these policy decisions and discussions are going on right now and so there is a need for folks in agriculture  to kind of talk about, you know, how do we think about addressing climate crisis because I fundamentally believe that that is something that exists as well, but recognize that there are going to be some myths and some solutions I don't believe it's eating,  
**[1:50:44-1:51:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:50:44):**  you know, acres and acres of soybeans, as a way to like make it happen, but, you know, shifting the perception of the cow right. I had two dozen conversations with folks last week, talking about how I believe that cattle can be part of the solution for fighting  climate change versus being kind of the monster that I think they're often depicted as and that's a discussion that's happening right right now.  And, you know, there's also, I think the discussion is starting between the kind of agriculture that you and I are practicing and hopefully most of the people listening to this podcast are practicing versus the conventional production model, which would be, you know,  
**[1:51:26-1:52:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:51:26):**  which would be basically feedlots, you know, huge confinement feeding operations and we can even talk about that and in hogs and in chickens, because it's the conditions inside a hog barn or chicken barn are just absolutely horrific.  I mean, let's be honest, conditions that a feedlot for cattle, they're not much better. And we got sold this lie that, you know, we have to have this scale, we have to have this efficiency because, you know, oh, one guy's responsible for, you know, 25, I've got a ride through 25,000 head of cattle.  I don't have 30 minutes to go pull a sick one out of a pen. So that's why everything gets antibiotics off the truck. Like, wait a minute.  
**[1:52:10-1:52:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:52:10):**  Which gets back to the historical assumptions and assuming I need to be at this scale to make this work versus if you focus on kind of starting small and building from a profitability mindset.  It's just a different way to look at it. I think, you know, the other thing too, like, and you bring up cattle and I mean, so you bring up pigs and chickens, right?  Whenever I have a debate with somebody who's a vegan, right? And it's saying, oh gosh, eating meat is the worst thing you can do for the climate. I have a very hard time defending eating chicken and pork.  
**[1:52:43-1:53:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:52:43):**  Like, I can easily make the argument for rabbit and cattle and sheep and goat and geese. I can have that argument and I feel like I can make a great case for it.  When it comes to cattle, when it comes to pigs and chickens, that's harder to do. The amount of inputs, the amount that is required to actually get them going, ecologically, it isn't great.  And so I think the more that we can have these conversations, honestly, and just say, yeah, maybe this isn't the best thing and maybe there is a different model and maybe you need to think about how this can come together.  
**[1:53:15-1:53:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:53:15):**  I think that that's going to be something that's needed.  So we're on this trail. Scalability. That's one of the things that critics of regenerative agriculture and supporters of the current system like to point out is they don't think that regenerative agriculture can feed the world.  And I would push back on that real hard. Like, I don't give a crap about feeding the world anymore. I want to feed my family first and then I want to feed my community second and I'll feed my country third.  
**[1:53:50-1:54:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:53:50):**  And if there's anything left over, then maybe we can think about feeding the world. The feeding the world mentality got us where we are.  And what are we feeding the world? We're feeding the world dent corn and soybeans. Bullshit. Oh, well, those are cow feed. Those are cow feed that have a lot of gallons of diesel involved and a lot of rubberized miles involved to get them there.  From where we're at to get regenerative ag to scale to where we could feed ourselves requires a lot more manpower than is currently available and probably a lot more manpower than people are willing to put in.  
**[1:54:30-1:55:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:54:30):**  Let's face it. Growing food is fucking hard. It's hard. It's brutal work in all weather conditions every day.  There's sometimes the highest emotional highs and the lowest emotional lows. And sometimes those happen within minutes of each other. And not everybody can do it. Not everybody can tolerate having their fortunes dictated mostly by the weather.  That's why people go to town and get jobs.  
**[1:55:02-1:55:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:55:02):**  Yeah, no, I look the scalability thing is a very real issue for regenerative ag I think there's two things though that I think always get discounted and ignored in those discussion in that number one.  And you're right, it's not for everybody but how do you inspire more small scale producers and more folks, thinking about how to manage their land in regenerative fashion how to manage their land where they're stacking multiple micro enterprises on a single  piece of land. Like how do you inspire more of that is one piece. I think the second piece is we keep looking at the world in the context and situation that we're in today of, well the way all the farms are set up right now wouldn't work for, you know,  
**[1:55:41-1:56:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:55:41):**  say you know kind of intensive grazing programs, but look like 30 years ago we were using, you know, the telephone to connect phones for the internet.  And now we've like completely gone away for engine completely, we've significantly gone away from that. And and and so the idea that things will remain in constant the way they are today, and they can only be managed in the way they are today with  a sale barn model and with the way land is set up and the way fencing infrastructure infrastructure is set up today and written how farmers sell their product, like, because it's the way it is right now it can never change is a complete fallacy.  
**[1:56:24-1:57:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:56:24):**  And so if you start to rethink certain things whether it's how we think about land usage, how we think about water usage, how we think about potentially mobile infrastructure right like the revolution that the poly wire and the real were for regenerative  industries maybe one step. What if we have robots that become the fence for cattle that are moving on a larger range, and like you have four robots that move together in unison constantly moving offense.  I make all this stuff up, but my point still remains. We're not thinking about where things are going we are just thinking about where things are when we make that argument of, oh, it's not scalable.  
**[1:57:04-1:57:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:57:04):**  You're right. You know, we can't just focus on what we have now, we have to look down the road to the future.  And we have to build a better agricultural future.  Not for us.  
**[1:57:17-1:57:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:57:17):**  Not just for our children but for our children's children, and the next five generations that are coming after them. We got to think about what we're leaving behind, and I have a really hard time.  Like, when a farmer that's farming.  You know, broad acre farmer to 5000 acres, you know, gets up in the morning, kisses his two year old and his five year old goodbye goes out jumps in the sprayer and drives around all day spraying glyphosate, or God knows whatever.  
**[1:57:48-1:58:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:57:48):**  Meanwhile, his wife took half the day off her town job.  Because both of their kids are sick, and she's running around the doctor's appointments.  Like, this madness where the madness is, we've been told how to eat by the people that are selling us the food that not only sell us the food, they sell the chemicals that go on the food.  
**[1:58:15-1:58:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:58:15):**  They sell the food, and then they get to sell us the drugs to fix the problems in our human health that the fucked up food causes.  There's a hole in the bucket dear Liza dear Liza. Yeah, it's.  Yeah, that's where we are. And then there's guys like you and me that are really trying to change the system, and we get so much pushback.  
**[1:58:37-1:59:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:58:37):**  It's like, guys, I really wish you'd realize what you're doing to the world here.  Well, I mean, let me, I'm going to play devil's advocate on you there Brian because here's the other thing that I feel like I want to continue to learn and if anybody hears this podcast and is in this situation please shoot me an email goldshawfarm at gmail.com,  because I don't feel like I've taken enough time to walk a mile in say a conventional rancher shoes, I know I haven't, I will fully recognize that I've spent a lot of time actually with conventional dairy folks around here just because that's what  
**[1:59:12-1:59:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:59:12):**  I've got in my area. But, you know, seeing large beef operations that are done in the conventional model. I haven't spent nearly as much time because I don't think you can promote change until you truly have walked that couple of miles and somebody  else's shoes either and so I do want to recognize that that is a weakness as well. But I think your point of, hey, look, things are not getting better as we keep doing the same thing over and over again.  That's, that's I feel like everybody can acknowledge that. What's the solution I wouldn't be so bold as to say I feel like I truly have it. But I think that there are better ways or at least ways that seem like they're better.  
**[1:59:49-2:00:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=1:59:49):**  And so how do we keep looking and seeing what the pitfalls are for somebody who's coming from that different context I think that's an important thing that still needs to happen.  It just seems like every time you know the big ag companies tell us we need to double down on something, you know, BT corn, Roundup Ready soybeans, you know, what's the new one dicamba, you know the dicamba ready crops.  Like, every time we double down and use like the next biggest thing that makes the chemical companies billions of dollars.  
**[2:00:20-2:00:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=2:00:20):**  It ends up being a bad deal.  And, you know, there's a point where I think that there's a breaking point where the producers are going to go.  They're just going to throw up their hands and go no, like this is not working. This path is not working, you're running us into a brick wall, we got to do something different.

Someday, some way, somehow, man.  We'll figure out this food system thing one way or another and keep the world from starving to death, I hope.  I sure hope so.  
**[2:00:56-2:01:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=2:00:56):**  Alright, you got anything you want to end with?  No, I think that's a great spot.  Alright, well that's it then. Have a great week.  
**[2:01:02-2:01:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=2:01:02):**  Awesome, man. Thank you for taking the time. This was a lot of fun.  Oh yeah, it was. It was great meeting you and you have a great week and everybody out there.  Absolutely. When's this coming? Let me know when this is coming out because I'll definitely want to promote it. I think it's a great conversation and such.  
**[2:01:15-2:01:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=2:01:15):**  Gosh, I suck at life. Probably some 10-10 or 10-17.  Okay, cool. Yeah, just shoot me a note once you're getting ready to post live.  Yeah, I'm trying to be pretty good about that. When I get everything loaded up and I start editing, I try to let the guests know, hey, you're next in line for editing, you're coming up Monday.  
**[2:01:38-2:01:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=2:01:38):**  But I can't send you links.  That's cool. I told you. Plus, you never want to share a link on a podcast because everybody gets their podcast somewhere else. It's always weird.  Well, I'm still trying to figure out how to share links correctly and promote.  
**[2:01:53-2:02:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=2:01:53):**  I figure one of these days I might actually figure it out and get more than about 20 people listening to this thing.  Well, I'll try to help you there. But hey, man, I really appreciate meeting you. Great chat.  Yep, great chat. Enjoy the rest of your day, bud.  
**[2:02:04-2:02:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/86-Morgan-Gold-Im-NOT-remotely-Regenerative-e1pajc9#t=2:02:04):**  Alright, thanks, Brian. Bye.

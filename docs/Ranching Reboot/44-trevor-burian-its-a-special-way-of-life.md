**[0:01:38-0:01:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:01:38):**  Doing well.  Thanks for having me.  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:01:41):**  Well, and CK's back.  It's been a little while since I've seen CK.  Well, first, Brian, I was in Myrtle Beach at National Grazing Lands Coalition or conference.  
**[0:01:53-0:02:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:01:53):**  And it was amazing to meet a lot of our listeners in person.  So if you guys are listening again, it's actually really great for you guys to come up and say  hi to us and just say that you recognize my voice before you recognize who I was.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:02:06):**  So this is my shout out to you guys.  I was going to ask how that went.  Like, did you have a good time?  
**[0:02:11-0:02:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:02:11):**  Like were there good speakers that you got to go listen to?  Yeah, you know, Jason Meadows was there.  So it was really good.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:02:19):**  They highlighted a lot of mental health.  And I thought it was really great because we haven't seen a lot of that.  I'm seeing this transition where it's okay to talk about if you're feeling vulnerable  
**[0:02:29-0:02:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:02:29):**  or you're not having the best half year or even years of your life.  And so just seeing that change of things that you, Brian and I talk about and we're like,  we need to talk about this and stop, you know, sweeping under the rug and thinking that no  
**[0:02:41-0:02:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:02:41):**  one has these same issues.  Connected with a lot of faces.  And then, you know, what I have to say is funny is, you know, like Trevor, I think you  
**[0:02:50-0:03:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:02:50):**  and I have had calls together before, but it'd be funny for us to meet in person.  And then you just realize that you don't look exactly like what you do in zoom, you know,  and you're like, Oh, okay, that's what they look like in real life.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:03:00):**  You know, some of them are really, really tall, some other way around.  And I'm just like, okay, okay, you just can't, you can't tell these things over even zoom  still how they will be in real life.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:03:12):**  Russell Hedrick is a giant man, giant bear of a man.  And it didn't, I didn't get that at all on zoom.  Yeah.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:03:22):**  So Trevor, thanks for, thanks for joining us.  I know you're kind of a busy guy.  Let's uh, well, let's introduce you to our listeners.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:03:32):**  Let's start off from where you're at and what are you doing these days?  So yeah, Trevor Burian, I'm in western North Dakota.  I was born and raised on the ranch I'm on now.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:03:44):**  And uh, yeah, I've been ranching, been back at the ranch for 11 years going on my 12th  year now.  Um, started out pretty conventionally, not really, you know, just kind of doing what  
**[0:03:56-0:04:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:03:56):**  everyone said, you know, what everyone said to do.  And did that for about my first seven years and ended up going backwards quite a bit.  And so I was looking for for something a little bit different.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:04:09):**  I stumbled across Gabe Brown on YouTube and kind of fell hard into the rabbit hole of  regenerative agriculture.  And here I am three and a half, three and a half years later, and haven't really looked  
**[0:04:22-0:04:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:04:22):**  back.  It's been a, it's been a fun ride.  And it's gonna keep, we have a long ways to go.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:04:30):**  But I, we have a purpose and have a trajectory forward now.  Okay.  I've already heard a couple details that were like different from what I had assumed just  
**[0:04:42-0:04:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:04:42):**  from following you on social media and interacting with you over the years.  So tell me about the family ranch.  You said you guys, you grew up conventional and doing things conventionally.  
**[0:04:55-0:05:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:04:55):**  Like, so let's break that down in just a little bit more detail.  Yeah.  So here in western North Dakota, my dad and a lot of people around here, small grain farmers,  
**[0:05:08-0:05:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:05:08):**  were a little bit too dry to raise corn.  There are some people doing no till dry land corn around here and can get some pretty decent  crops, but it's real hit or miss.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:05:17):**  We're in about a 14 to 15 inch rainfall environment.  And and so we're, you get west or east of us about 50 miles and for about every 50 miles  you go, you get about another inch of rain.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:05:31):**  I think it's the same way kind of where you're at in Kansas too.  Yeah.  We're on the bad side of that before it starts, starts getting more rain.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:05:40):**  But so we, my dad grew small grains, barley, wheat, oats, growing up full tillage, summer  follow, grew up with, with that.  And it, you know, it was, it was, it was tough.  
**[0:05:55-0:06:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:05:55):**  I could tell that, you know, my parents weren't making a lot of money.  My mom was a school teacher also and to help make ends meet.  And we didn't, we didn't grow up lacking for anything, but we definitely didn't have, have  
**[0:06:07-0:06:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:06:07):**  a whole lot of money.  So and then also my dad had a lot of health problems when we were growing up.  So I kind of got thrown into the mix in junior high and early high school, taking a lot of  
**[0:06:20-0:06:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:06:20):**  the burden and it really kind of made me not want to come back at all.  My dad retired when I was halfway through high school and started putting the cattle  out on shares and renting out the place.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:06:34):**  And I told him I really didn't want to come back to it.  So that's kind of how I left things after high school.  So then what happened?  
**[0:06:45-0:06:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:06:45):**  Well then I think this happens quite a bit.  You leave, you know, when you grow up in a rural community and super rural here in western  North Dakota, everyone around you farms and ranches.  
**[0:06:56-0:07:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:06:56):**  You don't even realize it's a special way of life.  And then you go off to college.  I didn't go far western South Dakota and then to Bozeman, Montana.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:07:05):**  But you even go into those places you realize that, you know, not everyone grew up the way  you did.  And it's a pretty special way of life.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:07:13):**  And you just start missing.  I don't know, you start missing home, start missing the countryside.  So I ended up back in Dickinson working for the Forest Service as a wildland firefighter  
**[0:07:24-0:07:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:07:24):**  and started working on my buddy's ranch on the side and realized I wanted to come back  home.  So I had an opportunity, the people that were releasing my parents' ranch, the lease was  
**[0:07:35-0:07:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:07:35):**  up.  And this would have been when I was 20, 22.  The lease was up.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:07:41):**  And I also had an uncle who lost a lease and had a whole bunch of cattle with nowhere to  go.  And so I was able to take on about 80 share cattle from my uncle to kind of, so I wouldn't  
**[0:07:53-0:08:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:07:53):**  have to go on big time debt, get my own herd started.  So that's kind of how I got started back on the place.  What's your land base and your livestock operation look like?  
**[0:08:04-0:08:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:08:04):**  So the operation I grew up on is 2200 acres.  And I started purchasing that for my parents when I came back here 11 years ago.  And then an opportunity came up this spring for us to purchase an additional 1200 acres  
**[0:08:20-0:08:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:08:20):**  right next door.  So even though it probably wasn't the smartest thing financially, it was an opportunity we  felt we couldn't pass up.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:08:29):**  So we took the plunge and bought another 1200 acres.  So we're at 3400 acres right now.  Wow, that's awesome.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:08:37):**  So and we can get into it a little bit later of you know, the economics of how you're making  that work as I think myself, a lot of people and myself included, I think we were pretty  far past the point where in most places in the country, you can't buy land anymore and  
**[0:08:56-0:09:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:08:56):**  pay for it with cows.  No, absolutely not.  And when I first came back to the place, I, you know, you know, looking at it up economically,  
**[0:09:08-0:09:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:09:08):**  as far as running cattle, I knew I wasn't going to be able to make ends meet just running  cattle.  So here in western North Dakota, we got to have good opportunities as far as they're  
**[0:09:17-0:09:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:09:17):**  being oil filled around here.  And so I had a job in the oil field.  When I came back and in 2010, working in working at a gravel pit in the oil field, screening  
**[0:09:29-0:09:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:09:29):**  gravel and crushing rock and it wasn't wasn't a whole lot of fun.  And so I did that for about six months.  And then I started my oilfield business doing noxious weed spraying on pipeline rightaways  
**[0:09:43-0:09:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:09:43):**  and applying herbicide to oil pads and electrical substations.  And and I'm still doing that to this day.  And then also I added an element of doing long haul hotshot trucking to Yep.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:09:59):**  Yeah, we almost had to make a trip right past me a couple weeks ago.  We almost made that work where you could stop by.  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:10:09):**  And I've actually driven past you a bunch of times, but it's always kind of in a time  crunch to get to get stuff down there.  And I thought it was going to work out that maybe I could stop it on the way back, but  
**[0:10:21-0:10:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:10:21):**  I ended up having to swing back through back through Denver.  But yeah, I've driven through your area.  Oh, a lot of times when I'm usually a little bit to the west of you.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:10:31):**  Usually I go Dodge City and south or clear water and south.  And you get over towards Clearwater that is a beautiful grass country.  So if your country looks anything like that, I get some pretty good ground.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:10:45):**  See Clearwater that's that's a little closer to Wichita.  I think that's east of me.  It'd be it'd be west of you would be between you and Dodge City, I think.  
**[0:10:55-0:11:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:10:55):**  Okay, yeah, well, it.  Yeah, that is it is a really, really pretty area up there.  Like between here and Dodge City, if you get out up out of the river bottom, which is all  
**[0:11:03-0:11:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:11:03):**  farmed up and you know, mostly center pivot irrigation, you get up on some of the other  hilltops and ridge tops and it is it's it is really pretty.  It kind of an underappreciated area of the world.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:11:17):**  And I think we could have talked about this last week on the podcast that, you know, and  you probably can attest this driving, you know, back and forth up, you know, through  North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Kansas, everybody thinks of as primarily  
**[0:11:33-0:11:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:11:33):**  a farm state wheat, right?  And everybody thinks of Nebraska's corn.  But really, Nebraska corn is just kind of narrow strip down to Platte Valley, and then  
**[0:11:44-0:11:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:11:44):**  the eastern and the state like the rest of it, you know, the middle half of it and everything  on the west, that's all sandhills.  And that's literally nothing but cows.  
**[0:11:53-0:12:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:11:53):**  And Kansas, you know, it's kind of almost the same, you know, there's like the wheat  production is in a few areas and the irrigation is in a few areas and the rest of it is just  fast open rangelands for cows.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:12:04):**  Yeah, I hadn't been through Kansas before three years ago, especially or western Kansas.  I'd been through eastern down the interstate, like and then through Wichita.  And like you said, it's flat wheat fields and corn.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:12:16):**  But you get over west and it's rolling hills, it's beautiful grass country and same with  western Nebraska.  When I drive down, I always drive down through western Nebraska and western Kansas because

**[0:12:35-0:12:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:12:35):**  I started taking the interstate a lot less and taking some of the back roads that go  up through the hills and because you know, they build the interstates where it's easy  to build the interstates where it's nice and flat.  
**[0:12:45-0:12:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:12:45):**  There's why the roads are there.  Yeah, exactly.  You catch quite a bit of heat on social media, or maybe I shouldn't say you catch quite a  
**[0:12:54-0:13:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:12:54):**  bit of heat, but you're really active and engaging with the people that I would say  are kind of critical of you and leaving critical comments.  How do you let that not get to you?  
**[0:13:09-0:13:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:13:09):**  Because there's times right of video that blows up and you know, it's 10 to one positive  comments to negative comments.  But sometimes those negative comments really eat up on you.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:13:19):**  So how do you how do you stay in a positive frame of mind?  Well, I don't know I was I was gonna ask you that same thing.  I'm kind of new to TikTok.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:13:28):**  And I've been putting content on Facebook for a while.  But with Facebook, you kind of only reach a set group of people.  And you don't expand that.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:13:38):**  I like TikTok because it'll throw your stuff up on a bunch of different people.  And it's a great way to engage with new people and trying to spread the message of regenerative  agriculture.  
**[0:13:48-0:14:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:13:48):**  You know, that's kind of probably both of our goals are all three of our goals.  And yeah, you're right, you get a mostly positive comments, people being being supportive.  But sometimes there's people coming after you.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:14:06):**  And I, first of all, like replying to those videos, I think, you know, it's pretty decent  content.  A lot of people watch that.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:14:17):**  And so that's one of the reasons why I do it.  But it is wearing when when people are just calling you an idiot.  And, and I, which I really don't, I really don't understand those people.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:14:28):**  I think there's three types of people in the, in the world, the people that will just watch  and never say anything and just scroll.  And then there's people that will comment on the stuff they like, and then just scroll  
**[0:14:39-0:14:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:14:39):**  past and then there's a third group of people that seeks out stuff they don't like.  And just has to ask a comment that I don't understand that I when I'm on social media,  I don't seek out stuff I don't like that just seems like it make your existence kind of  
**[0:14:53-0:15:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:14:53):**  miserable.  Right?  What is it you say they renting renting space in your head for free or what?  
**[0:15:00-0:15:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:15:00):**  What is the haters?  You're your haters?  I love I like haters like haters are almost as great as super fans.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:15:11):**  Actually they're better.  Because a super fan you have to work to keep them engaged.  You have to work to keep their attention.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:15:16):**  Some of it doesn't like you.  The code just follows you around the internet to talk shit on all your social media.  And that's a hater.  
**[0:15:24-0:15:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:15:24):**  And that's better than your number one fan.  Because you already get a live in their head rent free and you don't have to work for it  at all.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:15:31):**  Yeah, and I'm accumulating a few of those as we go.  But I don't know, it comes with the territory if I wasn't if I didn't want, you know, that's  a part of putting yourself out there and trying to engage people and spread the message, you're  
**[0:15:44-0:15:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:15:44):**  gonna get those.  So you know, I'm not gonna lie, it's there's been probably afternoons that have been ruined  because something people someone said to me and even how stupid it is.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:15:58):**  Yeah, if you know, the more you continue just have to learn from it.  And if I'm going to stay on that app, I'm gonna have to learn to let shit run off my  shoulders.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:16:08):**  I just take a break.  Like if it gets too much, I just you know, I just take a break.  I try not to open it for a while.  
**[0:16:14-0:16:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:16:14):**  And yeah, exactly.  But things cool down like the comments will eventually trail off the algorithm.  The algorithm will quit feeding people your video.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:16:22):**  Yeah.  And I like I posted that feedlot.  And that's my opinion on feedlots the other day.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:16:30):**  And I hope you're ready to talk about it again, because I'm gonna ask you that question.  That's fine.  And I was I was kind of hoping that it would have that video wouldn't blow up because I  
**[0:16:39-0:16:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:16:39):**  was going to get the whole world after me.  It was like I just stay below 10,000 views, please.  Trevor, I'm curious, your your transition from, let's say conventional to regenerate,  
**[0:16:54-0:17:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:16:54):**  regenerative mindset.  Then you find a gay brown, like he's going to be the closest guy to you.  In terms of this.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:17:01):**  Was there anything in his context that didn't fit yours?  As far as practicing regen?  What you thought regen is?  
**[0:17:09-0:17:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:17:09):**  Yeah, and I've tried a lot of the stuff that that he can do.  And I've I've failed at plenty cover crops is something he can do better.  They get a little bit more rain than us not not lately.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:17:20):**  They've, they've they've had under average rainfall, I think going on four or five years  now.  But I've tried doing like, seeing fall rye and then following that with a cover crop,  
**[0:17:33-0:17:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:17:33):**  and it hit or miss I can use I usually either hit on the rye or hit on the cover crop.  But just with how expensive it is not being able to ensure forage crops.  That's been the biggest challenge.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:17:45):**  And so I found my niche, like kind of where I think my ranch fits best in regenerative  agriculture is on the grazing side.  We have land that was once farmed and the soils are once good enough to be farmed, but  
**[0:17:59-0:18:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:17:59):**  they've been depleted and mined out.  And it's still going to make good grassland.  And I think if we regenerate the soils, I think we can get it back to as productive  
**[0:18:08-0:18:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:18:08):**  as it was when, you know, they were they were farming and or maybe even before with time,  but I think just where we are on the moisture scale.  I'm going to focus more on grazing and not farming and I got I got when I got into regenerative  
**[0:18:24-0:18:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:18:24):**  ag I got real into the farming side of it.  And ended up losing money on that on that too.  And still is a struggle because I have an NRCS equip contracts to seed cover crops for  
**[0:18:37-0:18:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:18:37):**  I think three more years, which which is fine.  I just got into that contract last year, in which I was doing that stuff without that  before which was even harder but farming has been been the biggest challenge but I wasn't  
**[0:18:53-0:19:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:18:53):**  farming before I got into farming just trying to do some regenerative stuff.  So that's been the biggest challenge.  Was that because there were because there is an equip program that would pay you to  
**[0:19:05-0:19:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:19:05):**  do that?  Is that is that part of the driver?  Yeah, um, yeah, so I had broke out before I had discovered regenerative ag, kind of  
**[0:19:16-0:19:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:19:16):**  my business model when I was first started ranching is I would have XSA I would put up  hay and sell XSA and I've sold hay all over the United States down in the panhandle Texas,  western Kansas, Nebraska, Colorado everywhere.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:19:30):**  And we had some really wet years and I was like, Oh my god, this is this is easy.  You know, not really understanding the ecology of, you know, keep taking those hay crops  and trucking them south.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:19:43):**  And eventually, we had some dry years and my soil had no cover.  I had mined out pretty much all the organic matter out of it.  And it just stopped producing.  
**[0:19:54-0:20:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:19:54):**  And so I figured, okay, well, these hay fields are tired out, you know, everyone says bust  them up.  So I went and burned down 450 acres of hay ground and tried to start farming them.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:20:06):**  And that that like that process right there.  That's what got me into debt.  And then halfway through that process, I found regenerative ag and kind of found a way kind  
**[0:20:16-0:20:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:20:16):**  of get out and let's get this stuff back into grass at some point.  So  Okay, so you say you found regenerative ag and I've pretty much been asking everybody  
**[0:20:26-0:20:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:20:26):**  this question lately.  How do you define regenerative agriculture?  Oh, man, um, I kind of got this question a little bit on TikTok too, or a similar form  
**[0:20:36-0:20:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:20:36):**  of a guy asking me if I thought his farm was regenerative.  And that is such a complicated thing, because everyone wants to put a label on something.  And like this farmer's regenerative or this now we could put that on labels.  
**[0:20:52-0:21:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:20:52):**  But when you get into that, then then you're just going to get people skirting the system,  you know.  But what I think regenerative ag is, is I think it is like a, you come to realization  
**[0:21:03-0:21:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:21:03):**  that the whole ecosystem, all the ecosystems work together, and you just got to stop forcing  stuff and you got to start working with the environment you're given and and nudging it  in certain ways just so you can you can improve it.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:21:18):**  And we if we mimic the way then the ancient ruminants, you know, migrated across our grass  lands and and graze and defecated and urinated and smashed the forage and and moved on and  then gave a lengthy rest period if we can mimic that.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:21:37):**  And we then we can get everything healthier and just realizing that all everything works  to just everything works together, and we can be a part of it and we can't we can't  force it.  
**[0:21:50-0:22:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:21:50):**  Have you done any soil testing?  I have.  I know I need to but just only so much time in a day and I figured, yeah, we're building  
**[0:22:04-0:22:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:22:04):**  a lot of fence right now and putting in a lot of water infrastructure.  And I know that that's just an excuse but I figured my time is better spent doing that  stuff.  
**[0:22:15-0:22:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:22:15):**  And if someone if someone's listening and wants to come do soil tests, and watch, you  know, a scientist some down there a grad student that wants to wants to do some soil tests  and watch levels increase over time.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:22:32):**  Come on out.  But no, we haven't done it personally, ourselves yet.  Yeah.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:22:38):**  And it's a challenge for me too.  Yeah, there's a lot of information you get from a soil test.  But what is it worth?  
**[0:22:47-0:22:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:22:47):**  And how am I going to pay for it?  You know, like you hear ads.  I'm not too far away from irrigated corn and soybean country.  
**[0:22:56-0:23:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:22:56):**  So I'm always hearing ads for you know, grid soil sampling and things like that.  And you go to the farm show, they talk about, oh, we'll come out and you'll do these 40  acre grids and sample your soil and tell you what you need to apply.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:23:08):**  Like, you realize I'm not going to apply anything anyway.  And your soil test probably is going to tell me what I want to and you cost over $100 an  acre to give me useless information.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:23:19):**  I think I'll pass.  But then again, you know, we, you know, I guess that's not really what we're talking  about.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:23:25):**  We're talking about like Haney's and PLFAs.  And you know, some of the newer tests that are going to tell you about like the microbiome  in your soil and carbon fungal ratio and things like that.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:23:37):**  I guess where I'm at right now, enough guys have had done it.  And including guys I knew that did, I didn't know they did it.  But I knew them from working with them or my brothers were friends or we were friends  
**[0:23:51-0:24:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:23:51):**  friends growing up, that once I got into regenerative or kind of like, really kind of found it on  Facebook, you know, kind of discovered the community on Facebook.  And you know, found out a few people that I knew did it.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:24:06):**  And they've been doing it for four or five, six years already and how well it was working  for them.  And I feel comfortable taking the leap without having to do soil tests.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:24:18):**  And I trusted what I was doing.  And now I can see the results, you know, on the ground with the grass and everything.  And so I guess I'm comfortable moving forward without the soil test.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:24:29):**  I know some people need to see the data in front of them, you know, in numbers to have  the faith to keep to keep moving, but I guess I'm not that way.  I think you're right to with you see the results.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:24:41):**  Did you share what those are?  Yeah, so when we when we started doing this, 2019 was our first year kind of doing some  form of adaptive grazing.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:24:59):**  I was starting out with zero residual on any of my on any of my pastures in 2019.  So it was a challenge even starting then.  But my grass lasted twice as long even that first year as what I was used to.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:25:15):**  I was used to running out of grass in my pastures in mid July or early August, going out to  my hay fields, hauling all the bales off, and then letting my kicking my cows into there  and letting them graze off that regrowth.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:25:26):**  And that would get me into end of October and then I'd have to start feeding hay.  And usually about October 25, I was feeding hay all the way through May 1.  And so that this has allowed me to graze longer even right now my cows are still out grazing  
**[0:25:44-0:26:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:25:44):**  and we got about another three weeks of grazing left.  And then we're going to go on full feed for January, February and March.  And then I have stockpiled grass ready for to kick on in April or as early as as weather  
**[0:26:01-0:26:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:26:01):**  will allow.  So just doing the adaptive grazing has it's changed our land just that rest period.  And I think it was on your podcast last week.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:26:17):**  What was Sage was his name?  He talked about just 100% forage utilization or just getting better, you know, complete  utilization of the forage you already have.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:26:29):**  That was my biggest increase that first year.  And just that realization of just harvesting everything you already have more efficiently  was the biggest jump and now you know there's an incremental jump every year as as the health  
**[0:26:43-0:26:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:26:43):**  of the land increases.  How did you drive that forest harvest efficiency?  So my first year was a lot of trial and error.  
**[0:26:53-0:27:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:26:53):**  And I would do a lot of wagon wheel stuff around water tanks with poly wire and I had  a couple miles of poly wire out there for it was kind of a disaster.  But that winter I got started watching more YouTube videos on on paddock design.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:27:10):**  And someone that really helped me was Jim garish and what he said about you're gonna  say when you said wagon well.  But I started doing strip grazing, strip grazing away from away from water is probably how  
**[0:27:24-0:27:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:27:24):**  I fence 90% of my pastures in the summer.  And that's putting the initial paddock just right around the water and letting them hammer  that and then eats.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:27:36):**  I usually do once a day moves once every day or two, but then opening up paddocks just  away from the water up to a half mile away, they'll trail back to the water.  But you don't run with a back fence.  
**[0:27:51-0:28:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:27:51):**  So when they're grazing away, I allow about a week for them to graze away about a week,  and they really don't touch the stuff they already graze as because they've trampled  it, manure urine all over it.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:28:03):**  And so they leave it alone until that regrow starts.  And I found that we have about two weeks usually in the summer before regrow starts.  So as long as I have them off of there, you know, within two weeks and then put a back  
**[0:28:17-0:28:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:28:17):**  fence up, then I'll then then I'm then I'm just fine that first first summer I was trying  to back fence everything as soon as I moved them in a different paddock back fence it  but I found that's probably a lot of unneeded work.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:28:31):**  Now if you're in a higher rainfall environment, and you have faster regrowth, or just if you're  in a higher rainfall environment, you probably don't want cows trailing a half mile back  to water and even that for me, I would like to reduce that down to a quarter mile at some  
**[0:28:47-0:29:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:28:47):**  point but kind of making sure everything only has a half mile to water right now is kind  of the goal I'm setting and I still have some pastures I need to I'm working on to achieve  that.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:29:00):**  Yeah, I, I'm probably gonna misquote numbers but you know, when you go past a quarter of  a mile to water, your grazing efficiency starts dropping off a little bit.  Yeah, but it really it really falls off sharp at that half a mile point.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:29:16):**  Yeah, and I've noticed that at the quarter mile mark the ends of the the paddocks because  I like doing a about a quarter mile by mile long pastures.  And that way when you chunk them up, you can the poly wire, so I'll do a better job explaining  
**[0:29:36-0:29:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:29:36):**  it.  So quarter mile, a mile long.  The perimeter fences single single strand high tensile, and then you can set the water  
**[0:29:45-0:29:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:29:45):**  right in the middle.  And then with poly wider wire set up your paddocks and then move away from the water.  That's kind of how most of my pastures are set up and I've noticed as you get towards  
**[0:29:57-0:30:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:29:57):**  that half mile mark towards the end of that, that pasture Yeah, you tend to leave more,  but it looks better from the road then.  Well, and then there's been it won't look really good.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:30:10):**  They don't won't look good at all from the road for about two weeks and then when it  starts to grow again, it'll look like the best pasture on the ranch from the road.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  
**[0:30:20-0:30:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:30:20):**  Can we talk about what you mean by 100% harvest efficiency because I think sometimes when  I meet with different types of you know, ranchers, they don't really understand what that means  and I have to explain it to them.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:30:35):**  So like when I get into it, I like to talk about there's harvest efficiency, there's  litter and then there's residual, right?  And so how did you how do you get into calculating like that 100% what your utilization is going  
**[0:30:50-0:30:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:30:50):**  to be?  Well, I think I think that's kind of a little bit of a dance you kind of do from year to  year.  
**[0:30:58-0:31:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:30:58):**  This year I of the stuff I graze, I probably took more than I should but we were in a drought  and I was trying to to to lengthen my recovery times and the stuff I wasn't grazing and we  weren't getting any rain either.  
**[0:31:09-0:31:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:31:09):**  So it wasn't like I was hurting damaging the regrowth, the plants are pretty much dormant.  So I took a little bit more and 100% harvest efficiency is probably what how I shouldn't  have awarded it because you're never going to get 100% you're going to trample some and  
**[0:31:24-0:31:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:31:24):**  you're going to you're going to graze some.  But I would just say 100% forage utilization as far as either being eaten or trampled.  And then you're never going to unless you go hundreds of thousands of pounds per acre,  
**[0:31:40-0:31:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:31:40):**  probably not going to get a completely flat but yeah, I would say majority of it trampled  eaten you don't have it grazed out and nothing one spot and then 10 feet over you still have  grass a foot high.  
**[0:31:53-0:32:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:31:53):**  Everything's grazed evenly, even manure distribution, even urine distribution, and it just looks  uniform when you look out there.  There's a feedlot analogy that somebody posed to me about this.  
**[0:32:08-0:32:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:32:08):**  Like they came out and rode around they saw you know, my strip grazing operation.  And he thought about it and he thought about it and he said, I understand what you're doing.  You're like that badass pen writer used to have done that feedlot I used to own that  
**[0:32:23-0:32:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:32:23):**  knew exactly how much to put in the bunk to where those cows would leave one kernel of  corn in that bunk overnight.  Yeah, that's that's kind of accurate.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:32:32):**  So there's something there.  If something was if something wanted to eat it, but everything got enough to eat and they  didn't want to have that.  
**[0:32:41-0:32:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:32:41):**  They didn't need to take that last bite out.  Yeah, yeah.  And I'm about to move pastures where my cows are now.  
**[0:32:51-0:32:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:32:51):**  Move them down into some lower lower ground.  It's actually like 45 degrees here today.  It's beautiful.  
**[0:32:55-0:33:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:32:55):**  And we got some weather coming in.  So I'm going to move them down into some lower ground and where I'm going to feed them for  most of the winter too, there's still some grazing there left.  
**[0:33:03-0:33:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:33:03):**  But there is a section line right next to this pasture that they're in.  And I got them just hungry enough where I just fenced off that section line and turned  them in there for the day and they are hammering it.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:33:18):**  And there's a fine line between getting them hungry enough where they're going to tear  down the fence and hungry enough where they're going to be standing at the gate waiting for  you.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:33:27):**  When they've been standing at the gate for about five minutes waiting for you and none  of them have tried to get on their knees and great under the hot wire.  I think you did a good job.  
**[0:33:36-0:33:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:33:36):**  But when you go out there two hours before move time and they're all lined up grazing  underneath the hot wire.  Yeah.  
**[0:33:42-0:33:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:33:42):**  Maybe you should have given them a little bit more.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[0:33:47-0:34:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:33:47):**  And it's a it's a that's the biggest thing is it's fun to learn and and mess up and you  can always adjust tomorrow.  That's the best thing about using poly wire is if you messed up today and didn't give  
**[0:34:00-0:34:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:34:00):**  them enough, you can you can redo it tomorrow and do a little bit better.  And if you messed up real bad, you'll make a note and you know, try to fix that spotter  graze a little lighter next year just just gives you so much flexibility.  
**[0:34:13-0:34:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:34:13):**  And I think that's something that that we can spend a little bit of time talking about  is when you are strip grazing, and you're moving your cattle daily or you know, multiple  times a day like some of our friends do, you're observing how you're getting that many more  
**[0:34:29-0:34:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:34:29):**  opportunities to observe animal behavior and animal performance.  You're looking at you know, gut feel how full is the room and how content is this animal?  You know, if you go out there and it's it's time to move fences, and your cows are just  
**[0:34:40-0:34:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:34:40):**  kind of milling around, they're not really excited.  Well, they're probably full, they're probably content.  And they're, you know, they know why you're there.  
**[0:34:47-0:35:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:34:47):**  But they're not super, super hungry, and they don't need to go rush and get in and go fight  and hustle to get the best stuff that's in that next paddock you're going to get them.  On the other side of the coin, though, you know, it doesn't matter how careful you are,  
**[0:35:02-0:35:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:35:02):**  they will eventually get trained if you're doing it at the same time of day, or if you  come out in the same vehicle of around the same time every day, they know what that means.  And they know we're going to go get fresh grass about this time of day.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:35:14):**  So you may have to take some of that animal behavior with a grain of salt.  But you can always tell if that animal is content, you can always tell for room is full.  And if she's content in the room, it's full at move time.  
**[0:35:26-0:35:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:35:26):**  You probably gave them enough groceries.  Yeah.  Yep, yep, for sure.  
**[0:35:31-0:35:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:35:31):**  And I've just found even doing this, you're handling the cattle more.  So you would think growing up or ranch just being just being a rancher in general.  I think we all think we're pretty savvy around cows.  
**[0:35:45-0:36:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:35:45):**  But I found my stockmanship has improved so much over the last few years, just from being  out there and like you said, observing cow behavior.  And I'm understanding why they do what they do, because you're out there so long, you  
**[0:36:03-0:36:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:36:03):**  kind of have a chance just to, you know, sit off and watch one, walk around or do what  you do.  When before you're kind of out there in a hurry, you got multiple groups, check, check  
**[0:36:14-0:36:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:36:14):**  water, check salt and mineral, throw a dump of protein tub out the back, nothing's out,  get out of there.  But when they're all close to you, and in a close proximity, you can observe them so  
**[0:36:25-0:36:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:36:25):**  much better.  And like 60 of them in two acres.  I mean, they're right there.  
**[0:36:32-0:36:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:36:32):**  You don't have to go very far to find all of them.  Yeah, and it's wild to see them eat plants you didn't think they would eat.  Like I don't know how many videos I took this summer.  
**[0:36:46-0:36:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:36:46):**  We were so dry.  And so the only green things out there were the weeds and the goldenrod, Canada thistle  and everything that everyone wants to get rid of.  
**[0:36:59-0:37:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:36:59):**  Well, the cows would go for that stuff first because that was the only green stuff and  I wasn't supplementing any protein.  And that they went for that stuff first.  
**[0:37:08-0:37:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:37:08):**  And it came through the summer pretty good.  Cows eat weeds, like and that's usually the first thing that they'll go look for in a  pasture is weeds.  
**[0:37:19-0:37:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:37:19):**  They'll, they'll walk by big bluestem, they'll walk by little bluestem, grama grass, buffalo  grass to go find you know that yellow clover or the white clover.  Sometimes they walk by it to go eat thistles.  
**[0:37:33-0:37:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:37:33):**  I've seen them run into a new paddock and go eat yucca plants.  Just the flowers or the actual green part of the plant too?  Oh, oh, rip up the base of the plant.  
**[0:37:45-0:37:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:37:45):**  Okay, like the base out and eat the base of the leaves.  Well, they won't eat it.  They'll just, they'll sit there enough, chew it up and they'll have it sticking out of  
**[0:37:52-0:37:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:37:52):**  their mouth.  And once they get all the all the juices and the goo out of it, they want, they just spit  it out.  
**[0:37:58-0:38:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:37:58):**  But you're talking about the seed pods out of the yucca, like the flower pods, like those  yellow blooms.  I got to try to get to some of those next spring before my cows do and and see if I  
**[0:38:11-0:38:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:38:11):**  can't like determine what it is in there that the cows are really, really after because  I'm sure you've seen it like they will run over each other.  They will fight each other to get those yucca flowers.  
**[0:38:22-0:38:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:38:22):**  Yeah, and it's kind of cool to see a cow run up to one of those and just wrap her tongue  around that thing and jerk her neck straight up and peel six of those things right into  her mouth and she goes to the next one three feet away and does the same thing.  
**[0:38:36-0:38:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:38:36):**  Yeah, yeah, stuff like stuff like that.  So cool because we just, I don't know, just ended that with the conventional or traditional  mindset you just think of cows only eating grass.  
**[0:38:46-0:38:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:38:46):**  And they'll eat a whole hell of a lot more than that if, if you if you can graze them  right and treat and treat them the correct way.  Willow trees.  
**[0:38:55-0:39:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:38:55):**  I have several of these cows that I have caught, like the first day or two in a paddock like,  okay, we're talking like 165 cows in this in this herd right now.  In 150 acre paddock, like, they're not starving, trust me.  
**[0:39:14-0:39:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:39:14):**  When the second day in there when there's still green grass down the down the bottoms,  when they're going and eating willow trees.  It's not because there's nothing else to eat is because they want to eat that willow tree.  
**[0:39:26-0:39:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:39:26):**  But why?  I wish I knew why.  Yeah, there's something in something in there they want some some micronutrient or something  
**[0:39:35-0:39:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:39:35):**  they're craving.  And I'll say this, like, the conventional black commercial cattle, or red commercial  cattle, not going to name any breeds don't want to make any breed associations upset  
**[0:39:50-0:40:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:39:50):**  with me this week, not like I haven't done that before.  Anyway, the English continental breeds.  They don't go after that stuff as much as my Coriantes and Coriante cross cattle do.  
**[0:40:04-0:40:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:40:04):**  The Coriantes and Coriante cross cattle are way more adventuresome in their diet.  And I don't know if that's because gut microbiome or generations of epigenetics and the commercial  cows being, you know, held up with high energy feeds and corn.  
**[0:40:18-0:40:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:40:18):**  I don't know.  Yeah, I'd imagine that you're probably right about that, that it's probably epigenetics  to a certain extent.  
**[0:40:29-0:40:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:40:29):**  You know, there's 400 years of adaptation in a dry environment where maybe some years  all they had to eat was sticks and rocks.  Well, it is kind of neat because they're controlling some of those willow trees in places that  
**[0:40:48-0:40:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:40:48):**  you know, I can't really get it willow trees are kind of impossible to control.  The only really way to control a willow tree is to get a beaver.  But we can talk about those later.  
**[0:40:59-0:41:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:40:59):**  I'll talk about beavers.  Okay, well, let's talk about beavers.  Do you have any?  
**[0:41:03-0:41:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:41:03):**  Yeah, we have a few.  I'd like to have more beavers are a controversial topic too.  And I understand people that don't like them.  
**[0:41:14-0:41:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:41:14):**  But I don't think they're very controversial at all.  I think they're awesome.  And I think people that don't like them just need to change their minds.  
**[0:41:21-0:41:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:41:21):**  Now that being said, I agree with you.  My buddy Kevin owns a resort lake.  And there's several series of ponds and a big lake and they're kind of an issue for  
**[0:41:35-0:41:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:41:35):**  him.  They can cause kind of an issue for him.  And my challenge would be to the state governments and wildlife agencies.  
**[0:41:47-0:42:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:41:47):**  I think most of us are starting to recognize the benefits of beaver.  Like instead of encouraging people to trap them, why don't we build a network of landowners  that are willing to host them and then apply some some public money to relocating them  
**[0:42:04-0:42:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:42:04):**  to where they are desired or where they would be welcome.  I think the biggest the biggest benefit would be obviously out here in the West where it's  drier.  
**[0:42:15-0:42:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:42:15):**  And especially you get into the mountains out in California and Oregon where they've  had Montana where they've had all these bad fires.  Every creek drainage that there that there was used to be a series of beaver dams.  
**[0:42:28-0:42:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:42:28):**  And around those beaver dams were riparian areas with lush green grass.  And you think of August and September right now where there's no beavers anymore.  Those creek beds are just dry and bear nothing in them.  
**[0:42:42-0:43:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:42:42):**  If we still had beavers out there, and there were green plants in every creek bed, we'd  probably not have so many problems with with fires.  I 100% 100% I would even go farther than that and say where I am here in the red hills,  
**[0:43:03-0:43:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:43:03):**  anything that's down in in the bottom of a drawer near a river or creek that's currently  being farmed that all used to be underwater because it was dammed up by beavers.  Yeah, and I bet you'd say the same thing up there in North Dakota.  
**[0:43:16-0:43:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:43:16):**  Yeah, yeah, for sure.  So how do we go about bringing the beaver back in and telling those farmers they can't  farm $20,000 an acre farmland?  
**[0:43:28-0:43:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:43:28):**  Well, that's probably that's probably not gonna happen.  Yeah.  But it is a bigger issue, you know, water, water rights, especially in the West and the  
**[0:43:42-0:43:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:43:42):**  arid states.  You know, I'm, I'm east of the hundreds meridian, but not by very much like, I think I'm about  98 some 98 and a bunch of change.  
**[0:43:54-0:44:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:43:54):**  So it's close.  You get west of that hundredth in water so much more important, so much harder to come  by and not having beaver up in the mountains, not having beaver on the arid plains, you  
**[0:44:09-0:44:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:44:09):**  know, there were you are in North Dakota and South Dakota and western Nebraska and western  Kansas.  Not having beaver there.  
**[0:44:17-0:44:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:44:17):**  I, I, let's back up.  I struggle to, I struggle to imagine what it would what that vast landscape would be  like if it still had beavers.  
**[0:44:27-0:44:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:44:27):**  Like, it's hard for me to wrap my head around, like, how much water should be on my ranch  because of where beaver ponds are and where they were.  I think they have been in the past.  
**[0:44:40-0:44:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:44:40):**  Yeah, and I'm kind of stuck in a place where I'm surrounded by neighbors that hate them.  I have a neighbor, and he's a good neighbor to a real good guy.  But he's got a motto, and he says it in every conversation he just has a hatred for beavers.  
**[0:44:55-0:45:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:44:55):**  The only good beaver is a dead beaver.  He'll say that every conversation you have with them.  And, and he owns quite a bit of river bottom that that borders us and, and yeah, he'll  
**[0:45:08-0:45:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:45:08):**  walk that river 10 times a year shooting beavers and cleaning out beaver dams and just hates  them so it's tough.  Like I have the opinion that I do and I'd love to have beavers up and down, but my neighbors  
**[0:45:21-0:45:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:45:21):**  are trying to kill them.  And then also, I have another neighbor that hires government trapper to come out here  and trap them so the government is subsidizing still subsidizing killing beavers, and I before  
**[0:45:33-0:45:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:45:33):**  I still subsidize is planning Eastern Red Cedar trees and then like they'll give the  next landowner money to burn them down.  Yeah.  
**[0:45:42-0:45:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:45:42):**  And so it's, it's a it's a it's a challenge and there's just so many things about about  the agriculture mindset that that needs to change it's a once you start realizing it  just so you realize how many things are just aren't quite right.  
**[0:45:59-0:46:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:45:59):**  Do you think so much needs to change because we've been trapped in a culture that doesn't  allow for challenging questions.  Like for a long time.  
**[0:46:17-0:46:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:46:17):**  Anytime you want to anytime you challenge any part of the traditional production commodity  system whether we're talking about corn, soybeans, cotton, beef, chicken or pork, you're, you're  basically told to shut up, sit down, get in line because we have to feed the world right.  
**[0:46:35-0:46:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:46:35):**  Yeah.  And that narrative is failing.  And I think people are really starting to ask, ask the right questions.  
**[0:46:45-0:47:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:46:45):**  I think it comes down to almost like a moral question like back when I was doing things  more conventionally, I knew I was degrading the land.  I didn't realize as to what what degree I was doing it, but I recognize that I was degrading  
**[0:47:00-0:47:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:47:00):**  the land and I had the attitude well better me than the next guy, the next guy is going  to do the same thing and I guess I feel I have the right to degrade this land.  And I don't know if if that's the mindset.  
**[0:47:14-0:47:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:47:14):**  You don't take it somebody else will.  Yeah, exactly.  But I knew deep down that I wasn't doing things right.  
**[0:47:22-0:47:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:47:22):**  And it like the same thing kind of applies with with the beaver.  Like, you know deep down when you're doing stuff that isn't right with nature, like it  doesn't feel good spraying to me doesn't feel good spraying pesticides, even though I have  
**[0:47:36-0:47:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:47:36):**  a business doing that, which is very ironic that I came to this mindset with a pesticide  spraying business, but I was gonna ask about that.  Well, but it's it's necessary evil right now.  
**[0:47:49-0:48:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:47:49):**  But no, just doing things right by nature and having a thriving ecosystem that a beaver  is a part of, and just like nourishing or nurturing your landscape or your resources  to try to create the mold, the best ecosystem you have instead of just looking at ranching  
**[0:48:09-0:48:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:48:09):**  like an extractive process or I'm going to extract this much out of this land this year,  instead of just seeing what you can get by just to see what you can get by by working  with nature instead of always trying to force nature.  
**[0:48:26-0:48:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:48:26):**  And the argument is, there's no way that can be profitable, but there's people that have  came before us and probably you currently are.  It can work, you know, it can be profitable.  
**[0:48:40-0:48:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:48:40):**  And you don't always have to go through the government subsidies and do what everyone  else is doing to be profitable.  It's worked in every environment that it's been tried in.  
**[0:48:52-0:49:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:48:52):**  And it has failed in every environment that it has been tried in.  And the reason that people fail at regenerative agriculture is usually because they quit too  early.  
**[0:49:08-0:49:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:49:08):**  They give up.  Because it's not always easy.  It's not always easy.  
**[0:49:15-0:49:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:49:15):**  We're much more dependent on Mother Nature than we are, you know, we're dependent on  Mother Nature for everything.  Vice being able to go down to the co-op and spend money and get an input or go flip a  
**[0:49:28-0:49:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:49:28):**  switch and make it rain because we have a center pivot or side rolls or whatever.  I forgot what I was gonna say.  But we're not looking for that input.  
**[0:49:43-0:49:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:49:43):**  You know, we don't, we have to deal with a lower energy budget, we can't just go get  that input.  So there's going to be years that yeah, you're going to have a crash.  
**[0:49:53-0:50:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:49:53):**  And it might hurt more.  But your successes are going to feel so much sweeter because it was all yours.  And you don't have to share that credit with the fertilizer salesman with this or the seed  
**[0:50:04-0:50:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:50:04):**  salesman with this numerical variety, right?  Yeah.  So yeah, off that one of the challenges I've had with cover crops is I don't use fertilizer.  
**[0:50:13-0:50:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:50:13):**  So back in 2017, I was talking about having my hay operation that I'd sell hay.  So I realized, you know, obviously removing all that stuff over all those years, all those  nutrients, it was like, okay, well, I got to add this shit back on.  
**[0:50:27-0:50:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:50:27):**  So in 2017, I spent $50,000 on fertilizer to fertilize those hay fields.  And we had a drought and when you broadcast fertilizer and you have a drought, that stuff  doesn't just goes right back up into the air.  
**[0:50:43-0:50:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:50:43):**  So I may as well let about 50 grand on fire.  And so when I, that was the year I started farming too.  And after that year, I said, I'm just not going to use fertilizer because, you know,  
**[0:50:53-0:51:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:50:53):**  what's if it's not going to work, what's the point of making the gamble?  And so I think part of the struggles I've had with cover crops is that I'm going into  with no inputs.  
**[0:51:05-0:51:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:51:05):**  And there's not a lot in the soil.  And so it's a lot slower process, which I kind of knew what was good that was going  to happen also.  
**[0:51:13-0:51:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:51:13):**  But man, on dry years, stuff doesn't grow very well.  And it is dry.  You know, I think I know your deal with drought, it's probably, you're probably a little  
**[0:51:25-0:51:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:51:25):**  bit deeper in a drought up there than we are here.  We're just kind of where I'm at, we're basically on the edge.  And I'm thinking about drought today because in February, I've been invited to the Society  
**[0:51:37-0:51:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:51:37):**  for Range Management conference in Albuquerque in February to give a talk on drought management  on a rancher panel.  Actually, my friend Hobbs is going to be on that with me.  
**[0:51:52-0:52:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:51:52):**  Oh, nice.  Yeah, I'm sure I'll, I'll mention some more about that in a future podcast and make  sure I have that on social media.  
**[0:52:00-0:52:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:52:00):**  But you mentioned something about drought earlier, and you're talking about it's dry.  Do you have a drought plan?  Yeah, I do.  
**[0:52:09-0:52:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:52:09):**  So kind of implementing my, my, my drought plan already.  And actually, just from here on forward, I'm not gonna, I'm just gonna assume it's  gonna be a drought every year, I think you kind of have to just assume next year is going  
**[0:52:24-0:52:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:52:24):**  to be a drought and approach it that way.  And so that's, that's kind of where I'm at, like, we're getting ready to start grazing  year 2022.  
**[0:52:36-0:52:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:52:36):**  I'm going to look at grazing year 2022 with the cow herd that I've got and say, I'm  going to say that this is going to be a below normal year, target 16-18 inches of rainfall,  you know, about 75 to 80% of my normal grass growth.  
**[0:52:53-0:53:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:52:53):**  And I'm going to budget to graze that.  And for that to last, the cows that I want to graze all the way to January 1, 2023.  Yep, and I already I have because our growing season, we have a really short growing season,  
**[0:53:09-0:53:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:53:09):**  we grow pretty much all of our tonnage between May 15 and July 1.  And so we have a really short, our growing season goes from about May 1 through, I don't  know, there's stuff growing on April 1, but we really don't have active growing until  
**[0:53:25-0:53:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:53:25):**  until mid May.  So our active growing season, mid May through mid July, and then our actual growing season  goes goes to mid October.  
**[0:53:38-0:53:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:53:38):**  And to be able to grow the amount of forage that I want to grow, I have found, especially  where my soil health is at, is I have to stay off the new growth when it's actively growing  like that.  
**[0:53:54-0:54:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:53:54):**  So I found it works best to go into stockpiled pastures until probably mid June.  So that those are pastures that probably haven't been grazed in a year.  And I try to give all my pastures at this point in soil health or our rainfall lately,  
**[0:54:12-0:54:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:54:12):**  I've just been planning for you graze it once you hammer it and then and then it has a whole  year to regrow the whole growing season.  And then maybe if I get regrowth, I can do a dormant season grazing on some pastures.  
**[0:54:26-0:54:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:54:26):**  But as far as growing season one, one graze and then the whole rest of the growing season,  it has to regrow.  So I guess that's my drought plan is I have probably 1000 acres of pasture for in the  
**[0:54:38-0:54:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:54:38):**  spring that that's going to have that full year recovery.  And that I'm not worried about that early season rainfall to kind of get stuff going.  And then hopefully in that time, the pastures that I have grazed this last year that I haven't  
**[0:54:54-0:55:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:54:54):**  stockpiled can can get that growth during that period from May to July.  Okay, that's right now I'm I'm rotating probably every two weeks stock density is fairly low.  We're living on stockpiled warm season grass that's just dry drier than dry.  
**[0:55:17-0:55:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:55:17):**  The expected or the normal fall moisture has failed to materialize.  So our you know, normally we've got some nice cool season grass everywhere.  I don't have any.  
**[0:55:30-0:55:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:55:30):**  So I'm really having a hammer with alfalfa to keep protein levels up.  You're supplementing with some alfalfa?  Yeah.  
**[0:55:38-0:55:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:55:38):**  Are you doing that in cubes or bales or how you doing that?  bales bales were cheaper bales were cheaper by about  bales are about half the cost of cubes this year.  
**[0:55:48-0:55:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:55:48):**  Yeah.  Interesting.  Yeah, we got a guy I'm comingled my cows with.  
**[0:55:55-0:56:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:55:55):**  He got us a pretty good price on alfalfa.  So  you go for like second third cut the fancy stuff or just regular alfalfa is good enough.  
**[0:56:04-0:56:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:56:04):**  Do you or do you have to make sure it's tested and at a certain protein level?  He had this tested and I think it was it was around 17 18%.  Oh, I'm not sure what cutting it is he might have told me I yeah, that kind of stuff usually  
**[0:56:19-0:56:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:56:19):**  doesn't matter a whole lot to me.  alfalfa almost 20%.  Good.  
**[0:56:24-0:56:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:56:24):**  I can I can grab that but we've really had to step up.  We're  we're feeding about five pounds a day right now.  
**[0:56:33-0:56:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:56:33):**  Do you when you'd usually get your your fall or regular moisture?  Do you have cool season grasses that grow all winter long?  Oh, yeah.  
**[0:56:43-0:56:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:56:43):**  Yeah.  Other than for maybe two to three weeks when the soil temperature is too cold.  I'll have good cool season grass growth almost all year like it's, you know, we're talking  
**[0:56:55-0:57:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:56:55):**  about the weather.  I mean, it's it's 73 frickin degrees here and it's four o'clock in the afternoon.  And we're sitting here doing this podcast.  
**[0:57:03-0:57:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:57:03):**  Not that I'm not enjoying doing it.  But the bad thing is the wind tomorrow, the wind tomorrow.  Holy crow, I don't know if it's supposed to blow up there, but it's supposed to blow here  
**[0:57:16-0:57:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:57:16):**  at 60 plus miles an hour.  We're not gonna be that bad, but we're gonna by tomorrow night, we're going to be well  below zero wind chill.  
**[0:57:26-0:57:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:57:26):**  So that'll be fun.  I don't know if I'd trade you.  As dry as it is tomorrow, we're gonna have single digit humidity temperature.  
**[0:57:36-0:57:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:57:36):**  Oh, man.  70s and 60 mile an hour wind.  So down there is right now that your biggest fire season over over the winter in this kind  
**[0:57:47-0:57:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:57:47):**  of dormant period?  I would say yes.  I would say yes.  
**[0:57:52-0:58:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:57:52):**  And usually, we don't get this kind of ugly fire danger until much later in the winter  and almost into spring like for this to be happening in December is not not normal.  Yeah, I never really thought about that about the southern plains until I started doing  
**[0:58:11-0:58:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:58:11):**  some trucking down there.  We're kind of lucky.  We don't get a whole lot of snow, but we usually at least get enough that we don't have any  
**[0:58:19-0:58:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:58:19):**  any fire danger in the winter.  But that gets to be a long time for you guys where everything is is brown and dry if you  guys don't get those rains, because the snow you know, as long as it's cold, it tends to  
**[0:58:30-0:58:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:58:30):**  stick around at last.  And you know, air temperature, we get the air temperature down like under 50 degrees  that really, really helps a lot.  
**[0:58:41-0:58:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:58:41):**  But once your air temperature is over 50 and your humidity single digits, it could be rough.  It could be rough days, but when that temperature is over 80 and your single digits and your  humidity, any anything hot is going to start a fire that will rapidly establish and be  
**[0:58:58-0:59:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:58:58):**  very, very difficult to control.  Throw in 60 mile an hour winds and I don't know what I'm going to do turn on the fire  radio and hide in the basement so I don't have to listen to the wind and wait for the  
**[0:59:10-0:59:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:59:10):**  page.  Oh, yeah, well, those windy days are the are the worst I can deal with cold and heat but  man when it's windy, it it's it's miserable to do anything.  
**[0:59:22-0:59:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:59:22):**  It's just the noise you just can't get away from the noise.  And it's so much extra work to even just try to stand up and move around.  Everything you're doing is fighting you every nothing wants to go right.  
**[0:59:33-0:59:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:59:33):**  But usually when the wind's blowing that bad, the cows just want to go.  They just want to go stand in the canyon be out of it.  They don't want to get up and travel and be out in it.  
**[0:59:42-0:59:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:59:42):**  Another grazing question for you.  So usually when you're winter grazing, you said you get some some regrowth.  So do you try to go over all your pasture once in the winter and kind of do a dormant  
**[0:59:53-1:00:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=0:59:53):**  season graze on everything or kind of what's your what's your winter grazing strategy?  I'm on pace to go around twice this year in this dormant season.  And I'm actually starting to slow that down.  
**[1:00:07-1:00:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:00:07):**  You know, as we get further and further away from a rain, I'm starting to slow that down.  So I get more days of rest in front of me.  And I might even have to step up, you know, feeding a little bit more alfalfa.  
**[1:00:20-1:00:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:00:20):**  You know, go to, you know, feeding two days in a row, then skip a day, then a day, then  skip and then to, you know, just just to get some more pound and gin them so they can utilize  the stockpile that I've got.  
**[1:00:31-1:00:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:00:31):**  Because I was I was really, really counting on having at least some cool season stuff,  some cool season growth, but it's been so frickin dry.  There's nothing.  
**[1:00:41-1:00:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:00:41):**  I mean, I still have some in front of me that you know, we that we're living off of from,  you know, October, November moisture, but it's going to be slim pickings after about  after about first January.  
**[1:00:54-1:01:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:00:54):**  Do you have a strategy where you feed your alfalfa bales like autumn pasture when you're  supplementing protein?  I'm trying all different stuff.  
**[1:01:03-1:01:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:01:03):**  So I've got a bunch of areas where the soil is really thin and really poor right on top  of a gypsum layer.  Like, okay, yeah, yeah, come out soil health guru, tell me how to graze this gypsum rock  
**[1:01:16-1:01:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:01:16):**  better to make it grow grass.  Like the only thing I'm going to do is build an organic matter in there, chip it up, stir  it up, add urine.  
**[1:01:23-1:01:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:01:23):**  So Avery would have told you to put a temporary fence fence around a lock the cows on there  for that night.  Yeah, I'm sure somebody told me to do that.  
**[1:01:31-1:01:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:01:31):**  But it gets back to a labor thing.  Right?  Yeah, for sure.  
**[1:01:36-1:01:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:01:36):**  We talked about that earlier that it's so much less labor to put them all in one herd  and move them every day.  I wish that I wish I could practice what I preached on that.  
**[1:01:46-1:01:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:01:46):**  The way my ranch is broken up, I've got highways and county roads running through the thing.  So I've got three big pieces, and then another 250 acre pasture off by itself separated by  roads.  
**[1:01:57-1:02:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:01:57):**  And yeah, I know plenty of guys move up and down roads all the time.  It's a blacktop highway with literally 200 trucks going down it every day.  Okay, yeah, I could move across it.  
**[1:02:09-1:02:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:02:09):**  I can move down it.  We got to stop traffic.  I got to have a bunch of extra riders and a sheriff escort to be safe because there's  
**[1:02:16-1:02:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:02:16):**  so much truck traffic on the road.  Can it be done?  Yes.  
**[1:02:21-1:02:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:02:21):**  Is it a practical thing?  Not really.  I would run the ranch as three ranches that just kind of happen to be adjacent to each  
**[1:02:31-1:02:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:02:31):**  other.  So I generally have at least three cow herds.  I've had as many as five different cow herds on the ranch at the same time being managed  
**[1:02:42-1:02:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:02:42):**  differently.  The year I had five herds, that was 2020.  I had a young lady named Megan working for me.  
**[1:02:49-1:03:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:02:49):**  And two of those herds we stripped raised.  And then one of them moved, then two of them moved like every other day, just about another  one moved about every week or so.  
**[1:03:01-1:03:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:03:01):**  So I don't always practice what I preach about having one herd and about having things  simple.  But you know, I also live 10 miles away.  
**[1:03:13-1:03:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:03:13):**  And yeah, it'd be great to be able to go out some nights and tease them with a little  feed, get them on to one of those areas, lock them up behind polywire, then go home, be  able to come back out there first thing in the morning, take that polywire up and let  
**[1:03:25-1:03:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:03:25):**  them go.  If I had one herd of cows, I could probably do some more stuff like that.  Work was a little bit closer.  
**[1:03:34-1:03:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:03:34):**  So it comes back to that labor question.  And we kind of opened up by talking a little bit about mental health.  And we both grew up in ranching, right?  
**[1:03:49-1:04:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:03:49):**  The mindset is, get up when the sun comes up.  You go and then you don't go to the house till the sun goes down.  And if you can still stand, you didn't work hard enough.  
**[1:04:00-1:04:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:04:00):**  You know, if your hands aren't bleeding, you're not working.  If you're not working six and a half days a week, you're not working hard enough.  If you're not making enough money, just go work harder.  
**[1:04:10-1:04:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:04:10):**  It'll fix it, right?  That's the mindset.  We've got to blend that in agriculture with the nine to five mindset.  
**[1:04:20-1:04:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:04:20):**  Farming ranch is not a nine to five job, never has been, never will be unless you're maybe  a contract chicken grower, contract hog grower, and you clock in and clock out every day and  you work for Tyson.  
**[1:04:30-1:04:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:04:30):**  That's what we're talking about.  In our line of work, it's never nine to five.  And that's a big leap I've had to make is, especially after I got into some debt is,  
**[1:04:45-1:04:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:04:45):**  you just want to work nonstop to get yourself out of it.  And I mean, in 2020, we started a meat business and still doing the oil field thing and then  ranching.  
**[1:04:57-1:05:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:04:57):**  Something had to give and I was trying to do some custom farming too.  And you just kind of run yourself into the ground.  I saw a picture of myself yesterday that I took in April 2020 when I was seeding and  
**[1:05:10-1:05:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:05:10):**  I just looked absolutely miserable and kind of realized after 2020 that we need to, this  isn't the way we want to live our lives and some things had to change.  And so that needs to be part of our context or what we want to work towards is we want  
**[1:05:28-1:05:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:05:28):**  to still have free time.  We want to be able to go to the lake on the weekend or have fun with friends.  And so one of the steps we did, we actually sold off all of our hang equipment here this  
**[1:05:38-1:05:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:05:38):**  last year to, first of all, that was one of the areas we were losing money in was putting  up hay.  How bad did your dad freak out when you sold the hay equipment?  
**[1:05:49-1:06:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:05:49):**  Well my dad actually passed in 2015.  No, no, no big deal.  But he was pretty good.  
**[1:06:01-1:06:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:06:01):**  I think when I left and said I wasn't going to come back, I think he was pretty hurt by  that.  And when I came back, he really didn't push me or nudge me in any direction.  
**[1:06:13-1:06:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:06:13):**  I think he was just so happy that I came back and he's like, you can do whatever you want.  So I sold a couple of his tractors that he told me to never sell.  And that's an emotional deal.  
**[1:06:28-1:06:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:06:28):**  You think they're just chunks of iron, but they've been around the place since longer  than you ever since you can remember.  And every piece of iron on the ranch has an emotional, sentimental story attached to it.  
**[1:06:44-1:07:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:06:44):**  Yeah, and it's stupid when you really think about it, but hey, they're genuine emotions.  And so I think he would have supported the decision just because of the situation, but  it was still difficult because of those reasons.  
**[1:07:05-1:07:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:07:05):**  He told me not to sell those tractors, but he can't buy them back from me.  Well the way the price of things on the used market right now, God, there's some iron that  was good investments.  
**[1:07:22-1:07:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:07:22):**  Like I was talking to a friend yesterday.  He saw 4840 John Deere tractor with like 12,000 hours on its sell for $75,000.  I think that's about three times what it cost when it was new.  
**[1:07:41-1:07:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:07:41):**  Yeah, I wish I would have did that well on my stuff.  I didn't, I ended up not doing that great, but it ended up being a chunk of money that  I'm able to, also with the NRCS equip in addition to the cover crops I'm putting in, I'm got  
**[1:07:58-1:08:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:07:58):**  signed up to do a bunch of water infrastructure.  And to do that, you have to pay for it first and then they reimburse you.  So you need to, I put in a mile long stretch of pipeline, buried it six feet deep and did  
**[1:08:11-1:08:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:08:11):**  a road bore and put in a couple of tanks.  So just one project I did and I mean, by the time it was done, that was over $40,000.  And so I kind of helped me bankroll some water infrastructure and so that I can graze some  
**[1:08:26-1:08:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:08:26):**  of those hay fields I was hanging.  And so it'll pay for itself in the long run, but it was a tough thing to do, but I think  it was necessary.  
**[1:08:36-1:08:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:08:36):**  You've got a trench in six feet.  Yeah, if we don't trench in six feet, it freezes.  We get away with like two feet here.  
**[1:08:46-1:08:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:08:46):**  What does it cost per foot to trench six feet?  I think it's going right about 230 a foot.  Well, that's not bad.  
**[1:08:58-1:09:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:08:58):**  No, it's not too terrible.  I think it's about a dollar a foot here to put one in.  So I thought it'd be a lot more than that since you got to go so much deeper.  
**[1:09:11-1:09:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:09:11):**  Yeah, but a lot of the water infrastructure I put up this summer is I put up a bunch of  above ground line for just summer pasture.  In winter pasture, I found you kind of only need one watering point like per piece of  
**[1:09:26-1:09:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:09:26):**  ground because cows can trail back in the winter and they're not going to do a whole  lot of damage.  And I think they'll go a lot farther in the winter than they're willing to go in the summer.  
**[1:09:36-1:09:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:09:36):**  And then sometimes there's snow on the ground and they'll supplement.  I mean, right now we got a little bit of snow and they're barely going through any water.  I have 150 cows and they're going through under 1000 gallons of water a day right now.  
**[1:09:53-1:10:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:09:53):**  They're just not going through much.  So it's amazing in the winter, just their water needs.  And so I started laying out a bunch of above ground line.  
**[1:10:01-1:10:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:10:01):**  And obviously I have to have it drained and everything unhooked before about mid-October.  But that works really well too.  And I don't know why more people don't do that.  
**[1:10:13-1:10:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:10:13):**  And then if you want to move it, you can just hook a chain to it and drag it behind the  four wheeler to move that black pipe.  And it's pretty tough.  
**[1:10:21-1:10:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:10:21):**  How big, what diameter pipe was that?  That was an inch and a quarter.  And it's the same stuff I was using.  
**[1:10:30-1:10:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:10:30):**  How did you get around that pipe picking up a lot of heat in the summer where you just  use it a short run?  I didn't.  
**[1:10:39-1:10:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:10:39):**  That was one thing I was concerned about because by the time that water gets the tank, and  we were hot this summer, we had a lot of days over a hundred degrees.  That water was pretty hot by the time I got to the tank.  
**[1:10:51-1:11:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:10:51):**  I mean, luckily the cows drank it and they still did all right.  I know Clay Connery has talked about this on his podcast because he was worried about  that too.  
**[1:11:03-1:11:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:11:03):**  And I can't remember who he talked about, but he said that we need to quit anthropomorphs.  We need to quit thinking of cattle like they're people.  Like if it's too hard-  
**[1:11:15-1:11:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:11:15):**  That's a hard word.  Yeah, sorry.  And they don't have the same feelings as us.  
**[1:11:23-1:11:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:11:23):**  So maybe they don't think that water's hot, but I don't know how they couldn't think it's  hot, but some people say that they've seen it so hot where the cows won't drink it.  I never saw that.  
**[1:11:33-1:11:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:11:33):**  They were still drinking it pretty good for me this summer.  I don't know.  Have you had any experience with that?  
**[1:11:42-1:11:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:11:42):**  I only set up my portable water system a couple of times this year and I only used one stick  of pipe, which is 500 foot for me.  And that was just to do some mineral water, to get some mineral water out for my cows  
**[1:11:55-1:12:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:11:55):**  that Steve Campbell talks about, that I learned about in an episode on Clay Connery's podcast.  This Clay Connery guy, he's got this other podcast.  Sorry for mentioning him.  
**[1:12:06-1:12:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:12:06):**  Yeah, it's kind of okay.  People might want to go check it out.  It's called Working Cows.  
**[1:12:11-1:12:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:12:11):**  He's got a few episodes.  He does an okay job.  But anyway, it was Working Cows 160.  
**[1:12:17-1:12:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:12:17):**  Steve Campbell was talking about mineral water.  And strangely enough, I listened to that episode while I'm out there looking at these cows  and I go, I see that.  
**[1:12:30-1:12:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:12:30):**  I see that cadmium.  I can see that.  So I got my Tomcat water system set up, got things moved around.  
**[1:12:41-1:12:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:12:41):**  Got some C90, like the salt's the easy part to find, the second water tank, the pump,  that's easy to find.  The hardest part about setting up that whole mineral water gag is finding a frickin burlap  
**[1:12:53-1:13:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:12:53):**  sack to use as a tea bag.  Man, I'd like to never find a burlap sack.  I thought I asked everybody in the world.  
**[1:13:07-1:13:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:13:07):**  And then I was sitting there and we're like, we're down to maybe getting one of those new  style really plastic feed bags and just poking a whole bunch of holes in it and trying that  as a tea bag.  
**[1:13:17-1:13:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:13:17):**  I'm like, I'll just call my buddy Nate who runs the ranch north of me.  Like Nate and I, I've taken in Nate's cattle for 13 years.  Our fathers ran cattle together out here in the red hills.  
**[1:13:32-1:13:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:13:32):**  We've met.  So I called Nate.  He's like, Hey, I need a favor.  
**[1:13:37-1:13:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:13:37):**  He's like, what's up, buddy?  I said, I need a burlap sack.  You know where I can get one?  
**[1:13:41-1:13:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:13:41):**  He's like, yeah, I got one right here.  I can run it over.  Like, Oh no shit.  
**[1:13:44-1:13:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:13:44):**  I've been looking for a burlap sack for like three days.  I've called everybody.  Nobody had one.  
**[1:13:48-1:13:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:13:48):**  You've got like, and he had a stack of them in his shop.  So how did that work out with you putting, uh, putting that tea bag of salt in?  So you had two tanks, right?  
**[1:13:59-1:14:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:13:59):**  Okay.  So, and then, and then one, you put the tea bag in or did you alternate days?  Okay.  
**[1:14:07-1:14:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:14:07):**  So I've got, I have my 16 foot fiberglass tank.  That's gravity fed for my solar system, like with 18,000 gallons of storage.  So that's up on top of the Hill.  
**[1:14:17-1:14:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:14:17):**  I drug my Tomcat pump trailer out one piece of pipe and my Tom and my, uh, my 250 gallon  portable pond.  Okay.  
**[1:14:28-1:14:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:14:28):**  So they had to build a little stand for the pump for the Tomcat.  I just threw it in the bottom of the stock tank, turn it on, you know, connected at the  portable pond, filled it up.  
**[1:14:39-1:14:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:14:39):**  Okay.  Got water down here.  I put a hundred pounds of salt in that tea bag and dropped it in there and came back  
**[1:14:45-1:14:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:14:45):**  in two hours and it was gone.  Wow.  The cows had drank it all.  
**[1:14:50-1:15:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:14:50):**  I put another hundred pounds of salt in the bag and left, came back in the morning and  it was gone.  Do you have free choice salt out there already?  
**[1:15:01-1:15:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:15:01):**  Um, yeah.  When we, like, when I started feeding the C 90 back in, back in June, I started putting  it out free choice and we started, and then we did the mineral water and we did it.  
**[1:15:12-1:15:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:15:12):**  Uh, we only did it twice.  Okay.  I only had it out for two days, but in those two days, I mean, that was like, it was 350,  
**[1:15:21-1:15:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:15:21):**  maybe 400 pounds of salt that, that went through that mineral water.  And it was immediate.  Like it was immediate and not every animal turned around.  
**[1:15:35-1:15:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:15:35):**  I'm not, I'm not saying that it's a miracle fix all, but I had several cows that had pink  eye pretty bad.  I had a couple of cows that were suffered from some, some feet issues.  
**[1:15:47-1:16:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:15:47):**  I had one that the day before I put the mineral water out, like I'd been watching this cow  and she'd kind of been going downhill for a while.  I was gone for a couple of days, came back, looked at her.  
**[1:16:00-1:16:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:16:00):**  I was like, Oh man, she looks fricking horrible.  Like she looked bad enough.  I would have shot her if she didn't have a calf, but she was nursing a fricking calf,  
**[1:16:10-1:16:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:16:10):**  blind in one eye, losing it in the other and probably didn't weigh 500 pounds, but she  was still nursing a calf.  So mineral water twice that cow, I can still find her.  
**[1:16:24-1:16:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:16:24):**  She still looks like crap, but she's alive and her eyes are clear.  Her feet are fine.  So the two rounds of mineral water we did after that, like prior to that, we're really  
**[1:16:36-1:16:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:16:36):**  like pink eye problems were on the rise.  Like we're heading towards a pink eye rack.  Mineral water stopped dead in its tracks.  
**[1:16:45-1:16:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:16:45):**  We've also been feeding free choice, uh, C 90 ever since then.  It's they've always had it available.  So was it the mineral water with the C 90 mineral water or was it the C 90?  
**[1:16:58-1:17:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:16:58):**  I don't know.  I think, I think that mineral water has so much more of an effect.  Like it's so much more bioavailable than when they licked the salt and then it has to dissolve  
**[1:17:08-1:17:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:17:08):**  in their room.  And I think it's just, I think it's just a shot direct into the direct end of the metabolism  when they drink that mineral water.  
**[1:17:16-1:17:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:17:16):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  That makes sense.  
**[1:17:19-1:17:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:17:19):**  I started using that.  Uh, well, I started using, uh, independent salt company stuff.  Is that, is that similar there in Kannapolis?  
**[1:17:25-1:17:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:17:25):**  Yeah.  Kansas independent salt.  Um, and I started using it the summer and it worked great.  
**[1:17:32-1:17:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:17:32):**  It's amazing.  You know, I just have it free choice.  I haven't done the mineral water thing yet, but, uh, it's definitely something I'm gonna  
**[1:17:38-1:17:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:17:38):**  try.  Like you said, if you notice it, your cows are noticeably lacking.  Um, the important thing with that mineral water deal is like the undissolved solids  
**[1:17:49-1:17:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:17:49):**  that are in the bottom of your teabag and they're in the bottom of your tank.  Don't put those anywhere where you ever want anything to grow.  Oh yeah.  
**[1:17:58-1:18:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:17:58):**  Okay.  So that's the stuff.  Yeah.  
**[1:18:01-1:18:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:18:01):**  Take that stuff out and dump it where you know, you're, you're doing your weed spraying on  a lease roads and around tank.  Cause it can be some ugly stuff.  
**[1:18:08-1:18:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:18:08):**  I mean, I don't know what it makes sense, but you know, if it's not going to get dissolved  in water, if it comes out of the sea water or, you know, ancient sequestered salt, like  a Kansas independent and it doesn't dissolve back into water, it's not bioavailable.  
**[1:18:23-1:18:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:18:23):**  I mean, it's bad.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[1:18:26-1:18:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:18:26):**  Yeah.  That makes, that, that makes sense.  But I've been really impressed with that stuff.

And then as the summer moves along and the grass kind of cures out and they'll start  
**[1:18:42-1:18:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:18:42):**  hammering that more and more.  Cause they able to get less and less minerals out of, out of, out of the grass.  And I was really impressed press this summer cause now when it was, it was real dry there  
**[1:18:52-1:19:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:18:52):**  for, for about a month and a half and I didn't have any protein and everything was brown  and all they were getting was that salt.  And um, they, they held, they held together great.  
**[1:19:02-1:19:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:19:02):**  And I didn't, I didn't, I had a couple of cows that had foot rot that I had to shoot  with some, uh, Draxum, but I never had any pink eye and a lot of people up here had pink  eye issues.  
**[1:19:13-1:19:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:19:13):**  And I don't know, I think that that stuff works really great in conjunction with the  type of grazing we do.  See, I think out of my calves, only one of mine, we had to dart and we only darted one  
**[1:19:27-1:19:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:19:27):**  of my cows.  She had foot rot, like bad.  And kind of funny is, you know, last year, all last year we were strip grazing, like  
**[1:19:39-1:19:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:19:39):**  kind of worked this cow into almost a pet.  Like she would come up, let me rub on her.  She eat cake out of my hand.  
**[1:19:45-1:19:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:19:45):**  Well, she gets foot rot and I got a shooter with a dart, a dart full of Draxum one time.  And now she won't ever come near me again.  How does she even know that that was me?  
**[1:19:56-1:20:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:19:56):**  I was in the Gator, like almost a hundred feet away.  Like how does she know that was me?  And you're just trying to help her.  
**[1:20:02-1:20:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:20:02):**  Yeah.  I was just trying to help.  Just come over here.  
**[1:20:07-1:20:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:20:07):**  I just want to let you eat this, you know, eat this candy out of my hand.  Yeah, um, are the calves, we only had to dart one calf and the criteria was, you know, we're  watching them.  
**[1:20:22-1:20:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:20:22):**  You know, like I said, we, we thought we, we both thought we were kind of headed towards  a wreck because I think we had to dart four or five of my partner's calves had several  of his cows were really, really keeping an eye on.  
**[1:20:36-1:20:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:20:36):**  And we wanted to keep the antibiotics out of them.  So we let them get one eye.  But when they got the second bad eye, that's when you get a dart and we did the same for  
**[1:20:44-1:20:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:20:44):**  the cows too.  So just apply that blanket policy on the whole herd because you know, like I talk about all  the time, we're trying to shift everything to low input, low maintenance, low requirement,  
**[1:20:57-1:21:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:20:57):**  you know, all as much of an all natural cow herd as we can.  So but the mineral water, I had to, it had to have helped like ever, ever since we put  that out there, the pink eye problems cleared up the feet cleared up some of the like the  
**[1:21:12-1:21:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:21:12):**  structural issues like that Steve Campbell talks about on that working cows 160 with  that look like a cadmium toxicity problem.  I guess they're like kind of humped up in the back.  
**[1:21:27-1:21:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:21:27):**  Yeah, humped up in the back with like the spine is ridged and humped a little bit.  Okay, kind of with a pronounced dip before the tail head.  Okay, okay.  
**[1:21:38-1:21:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:21:38):**  That's kind of what I was hearing.  And I saw a lot of that.  And after we did the mineral water twice and have been feeding free choice salts, you know,  
**[1:21:48-1:21:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:21:48):**  ancient sequestered c9 to your Kansas independent or Redmond's conditioner, I think that's what  Steve Campbell recommends.  I'm not gonna argue with him.  
**[1:21:58-1:22:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:21:58):**  Having that out there, I think has corrected a lot of those mineral imbalances and that  cadmium toxicity.  And he makes a point about like, a lot of these cow minerals that we've been getting,  
**[1:22:08-1:22:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:22:08):**  we didn't know we were getting from China.  And where's their quality control?  You know, and does a cow really need that?  
**[1:22:20-1:22:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:22:20):**  Does a cow really need all those fancy supplements?  Yeah, fancy mineral package.  Yeah, I did a I did a tick.  
**[1:22:28-1:22:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:22:28):**  I did a tick tock video, kind of on this or in on inputs.  And it's just a mindset where people think the more money they spend on their cows, the  more vaccinations they put in them, the more warmer they put into them, the more protein  
**[1:22:43-1:22:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:22:43):**  tubs a pot they buy, the better their cows are.  And I guess I used to kind of have that mindset too.  But when you really look at it, the return on investment just isn't there.  
**[1:22:54-1:23:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:22:54):**  It's just kind of kind of just those companies preying on ignorance a little bit.  Well, I think some of the light, a seven way BRD vaccine, blackleg, Pashturella, some of  those things I think are necessary.  
**[1:23:10-1:23:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:23:10):**  Yeah, yep, yep, for sure.  But there's a lot of them that that are not.  And I think that a lot of vaccines and a lot of health programs and veterinary protocols  
**[1:23:22-1:23:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:23:22):**  that producers use on our cow herds, like are self-fulfilling prophecies almost.  You know, if we didn't use them, we wouldn't have to use them.  But since they exist, and we've been using them, they're always going to need to be used  
**[1:23:39-1:23:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:23:39):**  like that.  Does that kind of make sense to you?  Yeah, yeah.  
**[1:23:44-1:23:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:23:44):**  If you do always what you, you will, you've always done, you're always going to have what  you've always had.  And yeah, if you use poron, you're always going to have to use it.  
**[1:23:56-1:24:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:23:56):**  You're never going to be able to work your way away from it.  And same goes.  I think the two things that bother me most are protein tubs and poron, both of which  
**[1:24:11-1:24:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:24:11):**  I don't think, I think about 95% of the time they aren't needed.  You see a lot of people that'll just dump protein tubs out on overgrazed pasture.  Well that pasture, those cows probably don't need any protein.  
**[1:24:24-1:24:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:24:24):**  They're probably, that's probably all they're getting is protein because they're nipping  off that little regrowth.  What they need is carbon.  
**[1:24:32-1:24:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:24:32):**  Like they need energy.  And old crappy dry bales.  Yeah.  
**[1:24:39-1:24:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:24:39):**  And that's one thing that bothers me.  And then just the way people relentlessly poor cows and think it's somehow working.  I don't know about your area, but it doesn't work at all up here.  
**[1:24:50-1:24:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:24:50):**  Doesn't work for lice.  It doesn't work for flies.  You know, it'll work for two weeks, but everyone does it in the spring and fall just without  
**[1:24:59-1:25:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:24:59):**  asking any questions or even does this work and, or even asking the question of what damage  are we doing to our, you know, to our land and to our ecosystem by adding what I believe  is a pretty useless input.  
**[1:25:11-1:25:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:25:11):**  Released up here in Northern climate, I know we have less problems with parasites and flies  and stuff up here, but I really, those are two things that just kind of perplex me.  Okay.  
**[1:25:24-1:25:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:25:24):**  When I bought my cows in 2020, I am not doing any poor on.  We're not worming them.  If I think they need to be wormed, we're going to go out and we're going to look at the manure  
**[1:25:34-1:25:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:25:34):**  and do fecal egg counts.  Then we lived through the blizzard of, you know, the polar vortex bomb of February, 2021.  And as soon as it warmed up after that, I started noticing my cows had lice and they  
**[1:25:56-1:26:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:25:56):**  didn't really, they weren't cleaning up into late April.  Like I'd expect them to the lice wasn't really spreading.  We came through and I used some poor on, um, forget the exact product that we use, but  
**[1:26:11-1:26:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:26:11):**  I made sure that it was one of those things that, you know, was, was labeled safe for  dung beetles.  Cause of course, you know, dung beetles are a priority and a few cows also had some ticks  
**[1:26:24-1:26:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:26:24):**  and okay.  I'm going to take some heat for that because of the way the winter was, I didn't plan things  out that well and when that polar vortex was coming in February, I pretty much stayed in  
**[1:26:38-1:26:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:26:38):**  the same paddock that I had already been for maybe a little bit too long, but I still had  grass down there and it had places for him to get out of the wind and the cold.  It's a choice I made and I got to live with the consequences.  
**[1:26:52-1:27:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:26:52):**  A quick question about, so when they had lice, you were seeing like big rub patches on them?  Yeah, from the shoulders forward, like shoulders and neck from the pole back.  And we're seeing quite a few of them get ticks like ear ticks.  
**[1:27:07-1:27:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:27:07):**  Okay.  Um, and then when you, when you poured, you saw that the, the lice kind of cleared up  five days, five days.  
**[1:27:16-1:27:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:27:16):**  Yeah.  We were done, done rubbing.  So that was in the winter of 2020, 2020.  
**[1:27:21-1:27:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:27:21):**  Was that last winter?  You mean?  Yeah, that was 21.  
**[1:27:24-1:27:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:27:24):**  Yep.  Okay.  This year.  
**[1:27:27-1:27:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:27:27):**  What's your plan?  Uh, well, I'm on a different part of the ranch.  We're going to keep rotating.  
**[1:27:33-1:27:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:27:33):**  I'm not going to stay anywhere more than a week.  You know, keep supplement with alfalfa, just keep watching them.  More than likely, we're probably going to want to go ahead and do a pour on just for  
**[1:27:41-1:27:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:27:41):**  lice and ticks again in the, in the late spring before when we work calves.  So like, what's your plan in the future?  Are you going to eventually try to wean off of that or is that just going to be part of  
**[1:27:55-1:28:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:27:55):**  something you have to do?  Uh, I, something I'd like to get away from.  So I don't have EIDs in all of my cows, but all of my, all of my calves, all my yearlings,  
**[1:28:12-1:28:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:28:12):**  they all have an EID.  So we're going to be keeping track of those as, as I grow all those heifers, the ones  that, you know, the ones that, you know, got poor on, but didn't look like they needed  
**[1:28:25-1:28:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:28:25):**  all the ones that look like they're fine with a hair, you know, with not having any, you  know, lice or tick pressure.  That's definitely, you know, a plus in the book, right?  
**[1:28:35-1:28:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:28:35):**  The ones that, you know, the ones that have the shitty hair coat that are getting ate  up with lice and ticks, I don't care how well they conform, you know, to the box I'm looking  for to put their body in.  
**[1:28:46-1:28:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:28:46):**  They're not, you know, they're not dizzy.  They're not taking, they're not a pest resistant enough to fit the program longterm.  That doesn't mean they're not going to stick around for a little while, you know, just  
**[1:28:57-1:29:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:28:57):**  for numbers, doesn't mean they're not going to stick around and be productive.  So those ones, so those ones that are a little bit more resistant, are you pouring those  as well?  
**[1:29:04-1:29:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:29:04):**  Or are you leaving those or are you pouring them and then just marking on that this cow  isn't having the problem?  Oh no, I'll have to make that decision next spring.  
**[1:29:16-1:29:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:29:16):**  And I'm not saying like, you know, everybody's situation is different and I'm just saying  up here, we're in a we're in a cold dry environment where we're at.  And we don't have the parasite pressure that you guys down in the south, you know, farther  
**[1:29:31-1:29:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:29:31):**  south do.  So I'm not I'm not saying a blanket statement for everyone.  I'm just saying as far as my observations around here, I think there's a lot of unneeded  
**[1:29:39-1:29:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:29:39):**  unneeded pouring.  I think there's a lot of unneeded pouring around here too.  And a lot of, you know, a lot of things that are unnecessary around here too.  
**[1:29:49-1:30:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:29:49):**  And you know, that being said, I don't have the problems that somebody like, like somebody  would have down on the Texas coast, or down in Louisiana or down in Florida or, or anywhere  else we all have a different problem.  
**[1:30:01-1:30:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:30:01):**  We're all facing different challenges with climate with forage with species mix of forage,  and with the, you know, even with the pest load, the native pests that are going to affect  our cattle.  
**[1:30:15-1:30:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:30:15):**  They're different everywhere.  And in some areas, you know, a dewormer product might work.  And it might not work.  
**[1:30:23-1:30:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:30:23):**  You know, what works for me won't work for you, even though we're looking at what may  seem to be a similar pest because of past overuse of that chemical in an area.  Which you know, that's something else that just blows my mind like, Oh, well, everything's  
**[1:30:39-1:30:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:30:39):**  resistant to this, this molecule now.  So let's just make something even more toxic.  Yeah, that's, that's not gonna work for very much longer.  
**[1:30:51-1:31:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:30:51):**  No, no, it definitely isn't.  So I still want to I want to hear your thoughts on feedlots.  Okay, yeah.  
**[1:31:00-1:31:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:31:00):**  Tell me what you think about feedlots.  Well, I don't want to piss them off too bad.  They still got to buy my calves.  
**[1:31:10-1:31:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:31:10):**  I think where we're at right now.  I think I think I think they're necessary.  Just we're just not set up to do anything different.  
**[1:31:19-1:31:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:31:19):**  You know, they're the for for that model to change.  I don't know how it would even be possible at this point.  Would it have to come from the government like banning CAFOs or or?  
**[1:31:31-1:31:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:31:31):**  Do you think it changes?  Or do you think that those customers just simply age out and aren't replaced?  Do you mean like people that that want feedlot beef?  
**[1:31:43-1:31:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:31:43):**  Or like corn fed beef?  Yeah, and you know, we don't have to restrict it to just you know, feedlot or corn fed.  But like, I started to think lately and I'm, I may have said this on the podcast and forgive  
**[1:31:55-1:32:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:31:55):**  me if I repeat myself every week.  I'm really starting to think that I repeat myself so much and I forgot what I was gonna  say.  
**[1:32:07-1:32:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:32:07):**  Well, I never really gave myself.  I think I think feedlots like I said, they're necessary now.  But they're just so inefficient and so relying on fossil fuels that, you know, there's studies  
**[1:32:19-1:32:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:32:19):**  that say that there's a less environmental footprint than grass fed beef.  And that, you know, that just doesn't take into the entire entire carbon footprint.  You have to use fossil fuels to seed that crop, harvest the crop or seed the crop, fertilize  
**[1:32:35-1:32:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:32:35):**  the crop, spray the crop, harvest crop, truck the crop to the feedlot, feed the crop, and  then haul the manure back out onto some field, not the field that it came or not the field  of the crops came from.  
**[1:32:50-1:33:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:32:50):**  And and then spread that out.  It is just so relying on fossil fuels.  And so how much longer is are we going to have cheap fuel and I know people are bitching  
**[1:33:03-1:33:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:33:03):**  about high fuel prices right now, but this is nothing like, what happens if diesel is  $20 a gallon?  How are we going to feed the world then?  
**[1:33:13-1:33:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:33:13):**  Like that's people's argument.  Oh, if we don't have feedlots, how are we going to feed the world?  Well, if diesel is $20 a gallon, how the hell are we going to feed the world?  
**[1:33:20-1:33:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:33:20):**  I don't think it has to be $20 a gallon.  So yeah, you're right.  So I've been thinking that like, it's regenerative agriculture, it's almost a hearts and minds  
**[1:33:35-1:33:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:33:35):**  game.  Right?  It's it's hearts and minds.  
**[1:33:40-1:33:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:33:40):**  It's connecting people with their food.  That's why we're being that's why a lot of us are successful in regenerative agriculture  because we're willing to be open and vulnerable.  
**[1:33:49-1:34:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:33:49):**  Tell the story, the open, honest, naked truth of beef from calf to plate.  The guys that are heavily invested in that feedlot, CAFO production commodity system,  they don't want you to see what goes on behind the curtain once that calf is weaned.  
**[1:34:10-1:34:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:34:10):**  They think that it's this magical process that you wean a 400 pound calf that somehow  magically gets turned into box beef and there's nothing evil or nothing environmentally destructive  in between.  
**[1:34:23-1:34:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:34:23):**  Don't don't look at that.  Don't film that.  Don't show that anywhere.  
**[1:34:27-1:34:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:34:27):**  Right?  So that being said, circling back to what I was talking about earlier when I lost my  train of thought, the people that are bought into that system, that are invested in that  
**[1:34:40-1:34:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:34:40):**  system and that consume that product, that really enjoy that product, you're not going  to take away much of that demand.  You're not going to take away much of that desire.  
**[1:34:52-1:35:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:34:52):**  You'll convert somebody here or there or maybe somebody will eat a little bit less.  Let's just call it CAFO product and start eating more grass fed, grass fed, grass finished  product.  
**[1:35:06-1:35:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:35:06):**  That ratio is not going to change where we make where the regenerative agriculture is  making huge strides is in new customers and the customers that we're getting are the young  ones.  
**[1:35:23-1:35:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:35:23):**  We're not getting the 60 year old city dweller that love to go down to Golden Corral every  Sunday and have a steak and they love the taste of that.  That's fine.  
**[1:35:34-1:35:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:35:34):**  There's plenty of people in the world like that.  We're getting the foodies.  We're getting the people that are passionate about their health.  
**[1:35:40-1:35:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:35:40):**  We're getting the people that are passionate about, that care about the environment.  We're getting the people that are just now starting to make money and spend their own  money in the marketplace and determine through the power of their spending dollar, they're  
**[1:35:55-1:36:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:35:55):**  voting with their spending dollars and that's what they're giving us market signals.  It was just a couple of years ago that grass fed beef was growing at 13% per year.  I think this is 2019.  
**[1:36:13-1:36:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:36:13):**  I heard these numbers fall of 2019.  Grass fed was growing at 13% a year, but normal, but regular beef demand, it was like two and  a half or 2.9%.  
**[1:36:26-1:36:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:36:26):**  13% growth.  I'll put that in perspective.  That means the demand is going to double in something like six or seven years.  
**[1:36:37-1:36:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:36:37):**  So we've got to double the grass fed, grass finished market in five years, five to seven  years.  We've got to double it and then double it again in the same interval in order to keep  
**[1:36:49-1:36:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:36:49):**  up with 13% growth.  That's incredible.  Yeah, that sounds great.  
**[1:36:55-1:37:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:36:55):**  That paints a pretty good future.  And we're not taking customers away from grain fed CAFO beef.  If we are, we're not taking enough for them to notice it.  
**[1:37:10-1:37:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:37:10):**  So I think we're not going to convert very many of those people.  They're going to age out.  They're going to continue consuming that product until they die.  
**[1:37:21-1:37:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:37:21):**  And then they're just going to age out and they're not being replaced by another consumer  of that product.  Why do you think in the agriculture community, there's a lot of people that get so passionate  
**[1:37:32-1:37:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:37:32):**  and fired up about feedlots and they're people that aren't necessarily directly involved,  but they're like feedlot adjacent like I am.  Like I sell my calves to a feedlot in the fall.  
**[1:37:45-1:37:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:37:45):**  So it's like people like that, that are so passionate that no, this model is working.  This is why we need to do this.  Why is...  
**[1:37:56-1:38:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:37:56):**  They're invested in it and benefiting.  Why is the ag community like so...  Why do they want to take up that fight?  
**[1:38:02-1:38:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:38:02):**  I don't understand why that's the hill they're willing to die on.  It doesn't make sense to me.  It doesn't make sense to me.  
**[1:38:15-1:38:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:38:15):**  It only makes sense really when you think about it in the context that they don't understand  what's really going on behind the curtain.  They don't understand that all these corn and soybean subsidies that get approved in  
**[1:38:31-1:38:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:38:31):**  the farm bill that everybody's senator or representative loves to brag about how much  they support farmers.  All those crop subsidies, all those grain subsidies are a handout to the packers who  
**[1:38:44-1:39:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:38:44):**  are foreign owned.  When I see somebody willing to stand on a hill and die on a hill and defend feedlot  beef, we talked about this a couple of weeks ago with Philip Meese, the carnivore bar.  
**[1:39:04-1:39:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:39:04):**  We basically feed these cattle to the point where we're giving them fatty liver disease.  We're feeding them to the point where they're basically getting diabetic and getting fatty  liver disease, but we're doing them a favor because we kill them before they die from  
**[1:39:19-1:39:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:39:19):**  the disease that we give them because of the diet that we force them to eat.  These animals, we feed them a ration that's too hot, that's burning up their livers,  that's burning up their lungs, that's making them sick.  
**[1:39:38-1:39:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:39:38):**  In order to counteract that, while they're standing in these small pens, ankle deep in  their own piss and shit, to keep them healthy, we're just going to mass feed antibiotics.  I haven't said this before on a podcast and I'm not going to name any names.  
**[1:39:58-1:40:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:39:58):**  I'm not even going to be very specific, but I was in a room with over a hundred other  people and we listened to a E-lot vet that worked for a big name ranch.  Tell us that his vet protocol had two different categories.  
**[1:40:20-1:40:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:40:20):**  Everything that came on the yard was either high risk or low risk.  The high risk cattle coming off the truck got a shot of Jackson.  The low risk cattle coming off the truck got a shot of Baytrill 200.  
**[1:40:34-1:40:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:40:34):**  This is a ranch system that runs a hundred thousand a year.  Now sit there and tell me that nobody else does that, that they're the only ones that  do that.  
**[1:40:50-1:41:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:40:50):**  That's horse shit.  That's protocol at every feedlot in the country.  It's confusing and why wouldn't they want, okay let's say we're not coming after necessarily  
**[1:41:08-1:41:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:41:08):**  how you feed your cattle, but maybe just the large operations.  Why wouldn't we want more of those feeding operations if you're so passionate about it?  Why aren't there, we need to get more farmer feeders again.  
**[1:41:19-1:41:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:41:19):**  That way at least that system that brings in all this forage and all this feed from  miles and miles around into these huge feedlots, we at least keep it a little bit local or  go back to a more localized system where there's a lot more farmer feeders and they can get  
**[1:41:37-1:41:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:41:37):**  that manure back out into their land.  It's not just all these nutrients just come to this one central location and then you  have a hundred thousand cattle in a feedlot.  
**[1:41:48-1:42:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:41:48):**  I'd love to see the return of the farmer feeder where everybody up and down the Platte River  Valley or the Arkansas River Valley or over the Ogallala Aquifer had 500 or a thousand  cows feedlot and they finished their own stock from shit they grew on their farm and everybody  
**[1:42:09-1:42:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:42:09):**  had their own branded beef program.  I'd love it, but I don't think that's a realistic reality.  No, and if we could ever get back to that place that's not a very big leap then to getting  
**[1:42:21-1:42:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:42:21):**  those cows out of the lot and then just grazing whatever forage is out on the fields whether  it's cover crops or grazing corn, but I think the first step needs to be probably getting  back our farmer feeders and I don't know how the hell we do that.  
**[1:42:37-1:42:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:42:37):**  Well how did we lose them?  I don't know that because I don't have much of a memory of a lot of quote farmer feeders  around here.  
**[1:42:46-1:43:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:42:46):**  I kind of had maybe this like highly idealistic thought in my head about what a farmer feeder  should be.  What does that mean to you?  
**[1:43:04-1:43:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:43:04):**  Guess a farmer that grows crops and either also has a cow herd or grows crops and then  uses some of that forage whether it's grazing crop residue or has silage and then brings  in buys yearlings to background them or to finish cattle just on their operation.  
**[1:43:27-1:43:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:43:27):**  But not somebody who's growing primarily a cash crop, somebody who's primarily growing  a forage crops.  Yeah, yeah, but you could, there'd be a way to blend the two systems by incorporating  
**[1:43:41-1:43:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:43:41):**  some cover crops and kind of having a diverse system.  But a little bit like what Gabe Brown has where he's got a, sells crops for commodities  but then incorporate cover crops and grazing crop residue.  
**[1:43:56-1:44:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:43:56):**  But there's so many guys now that specialize either cattle or crops and I mean they tore  out the feed pens probably 15 years ago and a lot of that infrastructure is gone.  So it'd be a pretty tough transition back but I mean we got to do something sooner or  
**[1:44:13-1:44:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:44:13):**  later.  What do you think the path forward is?  What do you think happens?  
**[1:44:18-1:44:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:44:18):**  Do we just keep going like this?  You know, there's so much there to unpack.  So breaking up big feedlots, getting back to more of a small scale farmer feeder where  
**[1:44:36-1:44:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:44:36):**  you know finish putting the craft back into finishing beef.  I mean grass finishing beef is a craft.  I have very little concept of that.  
**[1:44:47-1:44:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:44:47):**  I'll be the first to admit like don't ask me how to, don't ask me how I'm finishing  animals on grass because I haven't done one yet.  I haven't peeled and eaten one that I've done yet.  
**[1:44:57-1:45:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:44:57):**  I'm still working on that and hopefully by the time that I need to know, I'll know.  But it's an art and you take away the iPad, you take away you know these fancy apps, you  fire the nutritionalist.  
**[1:45:15-1:45:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:45:15):**  Okay, how do you know how you're feeding your cow?  Look at the manure path, it's pretty easy.  You know, we got to bring back some of these skills of just observation of the animal and  
**[1:45:31-1:45:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:45:31):**  how the animal is functioning because what science says is you feed this kind of animal  this kind of diet and it's going to do this.  Well, yeah, that works but what else is happening in there?  
**[1:45:46-1:45:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:45:46):**  You know like are we giving them acid, you know, we're they're getting lesions on their  lungs, they're getting liver acidosis, fatty liver disease.  Like why is this happening?  
**[1:45:57-1:46:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:45:57):**  Why is this happening, nutritionalist?  What can we feed our cows to keep them healthier longer?  Some of it is some of it came from the BSE scare.

Animals under 26 months don't have to be checked for BSE over 26 months.  I think it costs like an extra $250 or $300 in processing because of the special handling  
**[1:46:25-1:46:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:46:25):**  because of the BSE risk of an animal over 26.  So we got to cram them into feedlots.  We have to feed them all this super super high energy feed and blow them up to 1800  
**[1:46:37-1:46:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:46:37):**  pounds before they're 26 months old or 28 months old so they don't have to you know  take the BSE precautions.  You know and I know you said something about this.  
**[1:46:48-1:47:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:46:48):**  We just said like 1800 pounds like big cows, big framey cows.  They're great for making the packer money.  Great for making the packer money.  
**[1:47:00-1:47:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:47:00):**  Absolutely terrible for making the cattleman money.  The cattleman wants to make any money.  Small frame cows are where it's at.  
**[1:47:07-1:47:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:47:07):**  Yeah and I fell victim to that too.  My cow herd is still too big.  When I was in the conventional model I was looking at EPDs and chasing weaning weights  
**[1:47:16-1:47:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:47:16):**  and my cows I run a sematol Angus mix kind of right now but I'm moving back towards Angus  more and more just straight Angus but I mean my cows right now are 14, 1500 pounds and  they're too big and they go through more feet.  
**[1:47:35-1:47:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:47:35):**  So this summer I had some custom grazers out here.  I ran some yearlings that have a little bit of low line in them.  They're like a quarter low line and they were yearling heifers and when I got them they're  
**[1:47:46-1:48:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:47:46):**  only about 650 pounds and when they left here they're probably about 800, 800, 850 pounds.  And just seeing how little forage those like two of those yearling heifers ate less than  my one of my one of my cows and it just it definitely made me realize that you know just  
**[1:48:09-1:48:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:48:09):**  how much more these these big cows eat and so we've been this EPD model that's been pushed  on us that we need to chase these high milking cows high weaning weight cows that's come  from the pack are down they just want these big frames so they can hang you know they  
**[1:48:28-1:48:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:48:28):**  can have 1600 pound finished animals 15, 1600 pound finished animals and the argument is  you get paid more for those but what is the your feed efficiency to get that cow up there.  I mean it's a lot I have done a little bit of I haven't done a lot of it but I've been  
**[1:48:46-1:49:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:48:46):**  doing the grass finished beef thing for a couple years so I finished quite a few cattle  on grass and it's you can do it but it takes longer and you need the right kind of feed  and it's a it's a challenge. And it's a lot easier to get those cattle to finish when  
**[1:49:12-1:49:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:49:12):**  they're a little bit smaller frame so and the easiest cattle to get to finish and which  are the ones I sell are your young open cows that are still healthy and especially if they're  a little bit smaller in frame you pull that calf on them they come up open and you pull  
**[1:49:31-1:49:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:49:31):**  that calf on them and they even look at some green forage or some hay and you know they  balloon up and they fatten right up and those are mostly what I've been butchering and selling  and it's a great product. I mean those cows are can can finish easy they're fat and I  
**[1:49:50-1:50:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:49:50):**  don't know why they're not a more desired product honestly.  Because we've been we let somebody else do our marketing that's why.  Yeah we yeah there's this stigma that that needs to be this you know 20 month year old  
**[1:50:11-1:50:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:50:11):**  steer for anything to to taste good where when in reality an animal that young the only  way to get marbling in is just to shovel a whole bunch of feed to it but these older  cows they they they have a lot more natural marbling these fat deposits in their muscle  
**[1:50:29-1:50:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:50:29):**  that develop over the year that expand and contract you know throughout the year depending  on on the forage available. Yeah and they're used to putting on this weight and it's I  want to eat her where she this one I call her Peaches. Peaches has a calf look at look  
**[1:50:48-1:51:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:50:48):**  at how fat she is. Yeah and she's been she'd be great eating. What do you think Peaches  weighs? Uh 850 900. I think she was around 8 8 850 last time we waited back in September.  So what what are your yearlings weigh like 550 600 or? I'd have to go back and look  
**[1:51:13-1:51:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:51:13):**  I think the yearling steer I kept over he was around I think he was around 550 and the  heifers were around 400. Interesting. So they they don't gain a whole lot over the first  winter but that steer that I kept we tagged him we got a weight on him May 7th and we  
**[1:51:37-1:52:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:51:37):**  got a weight again on him on September 14th and I wasn't fast enough to see the weight  but I did see it say average daily gain 2.8 pounds per day so he put on a bunch of weight  this year. Yeah he's he's bigger and heavier than his mother like he's probably got two  
**[1:52:02-1:52:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:52:02):**  inches on his mom and he's bigger around now. So so with these cows you bought what is what  is your your plan as far as revenue for them are you gonna back around the calves or you  gonna what's your plan as far as marketing them? Oh well funny you should ask I've been  
**[1:52:26-1:52:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:52:26):**  working on that I haven't kept any of the steer I've kept a steer out of each calf crop  just so I can watch how they grow kept all my heifers okay and after we weaned heifers  for 45 days after they've been separated for the cow 45 days I came back this year we hauled  
**[1:52:46-1:53:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:52:46):**  out to wheat pasture last year we did a fence line weaning and I don't think I have to tell  anybody about how bad you get your head torn off with half coriander calves going to a  sale barn and I don't want to tell anybody how bad I got my head torn off going to a  
**[1:53:07-1:53:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:53:07):**  sale barn with these half coriander calves didn't think I had a choice I'm a little  smarter now so I want to be the seed stock guy I want to be the guy that everybody within  200 miles drives by and goes I want his cows because his cows live on sticks rocks and  
**[1:53:25-1:53:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:53:25):**  dirt and they give me a beautiful calf every year so my angle is more towards the seed  stock business I feel like I feel like if I've if I've predicted this trend correctly  I'm far enough in front of it that by the time the rest of the world catches up I'll  
**[1:53:47-1:54:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:53:47):**  have something that everybody else wants I think I think you might be right you know  make a small forage efficient animal that requires almost no inputs that's you know  disease and pest resistant that can live out here all year with minimum supplementation  
**[1:54:05-1:54:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:54:05):**  on salt the pasture and alfalfa that's going to be worth something that's going to be  worth something I think we're going to see a big shift as far as bulls go to where people  instead of going through these big production sales just buying them from from people like  
**[1:54:24-1:54:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:54:24):**  you that have a you know a good forage based operation because for a long time I was buying  my bulls you know over east around Bismarck and they would be wintering them on silage  and that's not my environment and I get them here and they'd only last two years right  
**[1:54:43-1:55:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:54:43):**  so I've started keeping a few of my own this is the first year I've left calves uncut a  few calves out of so my smaller frame cows and they had a small birth weight and then  I found a couple guys around here that have pretty good forage based operation and trying  
**[1:55:03-1:55:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:55:03):**  to get some some of those genetics because that's just the way of the future because  the margins are probably only gonna get smaller and we need to we need cattle that that do  well on grass especially if we don't have a feeding operation attached right and you'll  
**[1:55:21-1:55:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:55:21):**  like like Sage and I were talking about last week's episode or maybe it was before we recorded  the episode we were riding around you know one of the things that that I think may not  be as helpful as a lot of guys think it is it's come out late you know in the last few  
**[1:55:38-1:56:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:55:38):**  years out of the school that shall not be named is you know they like to preach that  raisin replacement heifers is really expensive yeah it is it has to be expensive because  good cows are expensive and good cows are worth it and Dallas will probably you know  
**[1:56:02-1:56:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:56:02):**  throw some shade at me for saying this but the the best replacement heifers are the ones  you raise like the only way to buy the best way to buy good cows is to buy the ranch they're  standing on yeah I'm actually my wife and I are signed up for the school that can't  
**[1:56:18-1:56:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:56:18):**  be named in January and I've been kind of mentally preparing myself just from talking  from others that have went what kind of advice we're gonna get because I got a buddy up here  in North Dakota that went last year and they ended up selling their old cow herd and they  
**[1:56:33-1:56:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:56:33):**  switched over to yearlings so it's just like I'm open to whatever I'm not I'm not set in  any sort of context but I'm thinking there's probably going to be some hard truths we got  to face when we when we go there so are you going in January you said Bismarck Rapid City  
**[1:56:52-1:57:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:56:52):**  South Dakota you're going to Rapid City okay I don't know who's teaching that one I might  have to find out for you but I know John Locke was doing the one in Bismarck in January that  as well he got to go do the one in Phoenix like a couple of weeks like a week or two  
**[1:57:08-1:57:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:57:08):**  ago and as punishment for getting to go to Phoenix in December he has to go to Bismarck  in January yeah I'm looking forward to it though but I'm I know it's probably going  to be a long probably emotional stressful week from what I've what I've heard but it  
**[1:57:29-1:57:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:57:29):**  needs it just needs to happen you said you're going with your wife yep you're not going  to be sitting together yep I know that they're gonna they're gonna break it up I listened  to that other that other podcast that that clay guy puts out I really enjoyed how he

**[1:57:59-1:58:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:57:59):**  that goes to the school is to call him Sunday afternoon be like hey buddy how's it going  how you feeling or like text month or not text them the Sunday after the school but  then text them the Monday while the school is going on like Monday about five or six  
**[1:58:24-1:58:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/44-Trevor-Burian-Its-a-Special-Way-of-Life-e1bs6pl#t=1:58:24):**  o'clock and just say hey don't go to the bar because tomorrow's economics and doing numbers  with a hangover sucks because you just watch you just watch they'll be you go down to that  bar Monday night and just do a drive-by there'll be a bunch of guys in there having a legendary

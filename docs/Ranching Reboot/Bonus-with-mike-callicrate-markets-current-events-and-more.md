**[0:00:34-0:01:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:00:34):**  Hey gang, Red Hills Rancher here with a special Thursday edition of Ranching Reboot.  Mike Calacrate and I got on the phone to discuss a few current events, what's going on in the  cattle market and what everybody can do to start making things a little bit better.  
**[0:01:00-0:01:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:01:00):**  I'm flying solo today.  Just me and Mike.  So here we go.  
**[0:01:04-0:01:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:01:04):**  How are you doing Brian?  I'm doing great Mike.  What's on your mind today?  
**[0:01:14-0:01:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:01:14):**  I'm headed to Kansas.  I'm trying to figure out whether I'm going to take a carcass truck or drive my vehicle.  Man, it is pouring rain here.  
**[0:01:26-0:01:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:01:26):**  It is so different than what we normally experience.  But at least we're going to start out with some green grass.  Yeah, I've noticed that you guys have been getting some good rain up there in the last  
**[0:01:37-0:01:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:01:37):**  few days.  So that's good.  We're just a touch behind down here, but there's a lot of rain.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:01:45):**  Looks like coming in the forecast the next few days.  So it's storm week, I guess.  Yeah.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:01:51):**  Good.  Oh man, things are getting really wild.  What was it last week?  
**[0:01:57-0:02:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:01:57):**  The Packers averaged a thousand dollars profit ahead last week?  Yeah, that's right.  And the thing we overlooked is in focusing so much on the meat packer profit, which is  
**[0:02:10-0:02:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:02:10):**  fairly easy to calculate, is we're totally missing out on how much they're handing to  the retailer and food service companies.  I mean, the real power is not in the Packers.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:02:22):**  It's in the big box retailers, from Amazon to Walmart to Kroger, Safeway, Albertsons.  And then of course Cisco is the huge buyer of a lot of this.  And they've really got the power to push the packer down on the price.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:02:43):**  And then the packer just turns to the producer, which is the course of least resistance in  the easiest price to reduce, and they just reduce it.  And we've never seen a bigger spread between what they're getting for beef and what they're  
**[0:02:56-0:03:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:02:56):**  paying for cattle.  But they just feel so confident that law enforcement isn't going to do anything to them or make  them stop.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:03:06):**  And we've given them reason to think that.  Ever since the office I was involved in in 2004 against Tyson IPP was overturned by the  judge and the Supreme Court refused to hear it.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:03:20):**  That gave these meat packers the green light.  It emboldened them to continue to just take more and more from that course of least resistance,  which is the producer of livestock, and just hand it off to the big retailer and that and  
**[0:03:36-0:03:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:03:36):**  their own profits.  And so today the thing is completely out of control.  None of the solutions anybody's talking about are even anything close to working.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:03:44):**  I mean the 50-14 rule is just a joke.  It just delays the inevitable that we have to break them up.  We have to take away their power.  
**[0:03:54-0:04:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:03:54):**  And we don't have that mentality right now in Congress and in law enforcement to go that  far, even though we are far more concentrated today than we were during the robber baron  era of 125 years ago when we broke them up the last time, along with Standard Oil and  
**[0:04:12-0:04:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:04:12):**  the railroad and the banks and the big meat packers were broken up.  And we know how to do it.  We've got a good formula for doing it and we could save this cattle industry tomorrow  
**[0:04:24-0:04:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:04:24):**  if we just had the leadership to do it.  But so much of Congress, so many of those in our agencies in the United States are beholden  to the packer.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:04:37):**  And they drank the Kool-Aid.  Absolutely.  Well, they drank this globalization Kool-Aid that said we need big companies to do business  
**[0:04:46-0:04:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:04:46):**  globally.  And that is simply not true.  I mean that is the recipe for the United States completely losing their food supply and ability  
**[0:04:56-0:05:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:04:56):**  to feed themselves, which we've already done.  We're already a net food importer on a value basis.  And we just continue to increase imports of all kinds of other things, mainly beef.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:05:11):**  And honestly, we just don't need if we would just enforce a few antitrust laws and stop  these ridiculous imports of way below cost of production.  The made in the USA label, especially on food, it doesn't mean what it used to.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:05:28):**  That's right.  They can import every ingredient in a box or in a package or in saran wrap and put it  together in a factory here and freeze it and call it product of USA.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:05:42):**  And I think that's just utterly ridiculous.  Well, look at these state labels like the Colorado Proud label, which is supposed to  encourage you to buy local.  
**[0:05:53-0:06:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:05:53):**  Canadian tomatoes come in during the winter, repack their greenhouse tomatoes.  They're repacked in Colorado and they get the Colorado Proud sticker.  So the consumer is really being deceived.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:06:10):**  They have no way of figuring this out.  They don't realize that beef crossing the border in the United States upon repackaging  it's the product of the USA label.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:06:20):**  They just can't figure it out.  It's gotten too complicated.  And they've also gotten very tired of having to read these labels.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:06:27):**  And even though they're misleading and deceptive and outright fraudulent, the consumer, I think,  is just sort of giving up and realize there's just not going to be any law enforcement.  It's a free for all.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:06:39):**  The biggest cheater wins.  And that's the economy we have today.  But right now, you asked me what I'm thinking about.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:06:47):**  I'm just thinking about how many cattle producers are going out of business right now.  How many years and boy, if it comes fall and this calf run starts, this thing hasn't been  fixed.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:06:58):**  If we haven't agreed on a solution by then, we are just going to have a whole wave of  cattle producers go out of business.  You just cannot survive on the crumbs that the packers are giving us.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:07:10):**  After 18 months of meetings and, oh, we have to have all these triggers and these black  swan events.  We've had them.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:07:18):**  They've all happened.  And what are they still doing?  They're just talking.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:07:24):**  And so these folks all meet next week or Monday and they're going to agree on something.  These are groups that really don't agree on anything much, particularly policy around  the cattle and beef industries.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:07:39):**  And we're talking about NCBA, Farm Bureau being on the side of the packers and essentially  everyone else from our calf to US cattlemen and so forth being on the side of the producer.  So we're going to meet in Phoenix and we're all going to agree on a solution.  
**[0:07:55-0:08:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:07:55):**  Well, isn't it interesting that the very first thing that came up was we have to sign this  confidentiality agreement.  Well, is that the same confidentiality that the price reporting has installed to keep  
**[0:08:09-0:08:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:08:09):**  us knowing what the premium prices are being paid to these captive supply feedlots?  I mean, and of course it was met with, all right, we'll see you later.  We don't have time for this BS.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:08:22):**  But that's what the NCBA was imposing on the group as they arrived in Phoenix.  It's all got to be secret.  Well we've got to pull the curtain back and shine the bright light in.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:08:33):**  And we need to see every nook and corner and cranny of what's going on in this market,  this broken marketplace.  There's all kinds of bad things happening.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:08:43):**  I mean, there's cost plus guarantees going out to certain feeders.  You know, we've got the Easter day up in Washington state.  Why didn't they have the same deal that Paul Engler and Cactus Feeders has that protects  
**[0:08:57-0:09:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:08:57):**  them from losing money on cattle?  No, Tyson treated Easter day different.  They just gave that, they were happy to settle just for a place to kill their cattle.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:09:05):**  They didn't care about the price so much.  Well now they care about the price after two of those Black Swan events that you just mentioned.  You know, the Tyson fire and the COVID disaster.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:09:17):**  You know, they're behind $200 million or more, played the futures market, probably got in  a lot deeper.  And, you know, it just all blew up.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:09:26):**  That's really honestly, whose fault is it that those guys were never paid a price that  they could live with on the cattle they were producing for Tyson in the Northwest?  And then we're bringing all of these imports in from these South American countries, from  
**[0:09:40-0:09:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:09:40):**  the Australians, and there isn't any of that product that's paying the cost of production  in those countries.  I don't even think it pays the cost of shipping.  
**[0:09:49-0:10:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:09:49):**  And aren't imports up like year to date over last year, which was a record year for imports?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know, the shipping, you'd be surprised how cheap the shipping is.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:10:04):**  You know, last time I checked when the Australian beef put me out of the Chipotle accounts,  the freight on that beef from Australia was seven and a half cents a pound.  So it's really cheap.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:10:17):**  It's cheap to ship it in these massive ocean-going vessels.  Big boats, yeah.  Yeah, but the point I'm making is the people in Australia, our friends that produce cattle  
**[0:10:28-0:10:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:10:28):**  in Australia are just getting slaughtered in the price they're getting offered by the  big meat packers, JBS and Cargill in that country.  And the same is true in Brazil with Marfig and JBS just literally stealing the cattle  
**[0:10:44-0:10:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:10:44):**  from those South American producers.  And so the only people winning are the middlemen, the middlemen of the big meat packers and  the big retailers and food service companies.  
**[0:10:56-0:11:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:10:56):**  You just got to break them up, but they've got to stop the bleeding.  Congress needs to jump in right now and do what we did 125 years ago and just tell them  there's only a certain amount of margin that you're going to be allowed to make.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:11:10):**  And that's it.  Since you've broken the rules or there are no rules anymore, we've got to take control  because we're simply not going to have anybody left on the land before this is over.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:11:23):**  And we can't build small plants fast enough.  Well, and if you did, you couldn't get market access.  So the big fools game right now is people wanting to build plants and not having a market.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:11:37):**  But just say that because Tyson and JBS and Cargill are making $1,000 a head on their  cattle, you're not going to make that.  In fact, you're going to go bankrupt.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:11:47):**  If you build a small plant right now that in an effort to try to compete with them,  you are out of here.  I mean, they will predatory price you out of the market.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:11:57):**  You will not sell a pound of meat to any of the big retailers.  Micro community plants.  It has to be small.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:12:05):**  It has to meet the needs of the community and it has to sell direct to the end consumer.  That's the only way that works.  But what I see, Brian, that troubles me a lot is this new plant up in North Platte,  
**[0:12:16-0:12:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:12:16):**  Nebraska.  You know, they're talking about killing X number of animals a day.  But really what it is, is a mini version of a big plant.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:12:26):**  And when you look at the problems of the big plant with refugee workers, you know, shoulder  to shoulder, they steal the cattle to begin with.  They externalize so many of their costs that they should be paying their workers.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:12:41):**  They degrade the environment with those big slaughter facilities.  And to build a mini version of that in North Platte, Nebraska or anywhere else is wrong.  We need to be building more plants that are more local regional that have more direct  
**[0:12:57-0:13:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:12:57):**  access to the consumer, but pay workers a living wage.  Don't externalize costs.  Handle your slaughter waste responsibly.  
**[0:13:06-0:13:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:13:06):**  You know, kill cattle closer to where they are.  I mean, one of the big problems with the big plants is they're hauling these cattle so  far, and the producer has to pay the freight.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:13:18):**  And so they just lose at every single turn.  And to build mini versions of those is a serious mistake.  Now, we've seen some of that occur where Walmart made a deal with Creekstone.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:13:31):**  And you remember back when it was Future Bees.  It lost $250 or $300 million when its retail partner Safeway jumped ship.  And so that plant went through all kinds of financial disasters, ended up owned by a bank  
**[0:13:47-0:14:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:13:47):**  out of Nova Scotia.  And then several operations later, we've got it now sold to the Japanese, who then partnered  with Walmart.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:14:00):**  So they've got a retail partner.  Creekstone's got a retail partner, and that's one of those smaller plants.  It's sort of a mini version of a big plant.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:14:07):**  But that's one of those plants that has got a retail partner that's probably going to  make it okay for them.  Plus they've got the exports they can go into Japan with at those premium prices.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:14:19):**  And so-  Is it a partner or is it Walmart's own captive supply or Walmart's-  Well, it's Walmart's version of captive supply and supply chain management.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:14:30):**  And so Walmart goes in and they contract with Creekstone to slaughter cattle, and they're  good Angus cattle, and then those carcasses or those boxes or whatever they are, are going  to go to Alabama to that new plant that Walmart just built for value added.  
**[0:14:47-0:14:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:14:47):**  And so now they've got their own little supply chain that is just as extractive as anybody  else's.  They're not paying enough for the cattle, they're not paying the workers enough.  
**[0:14:56-0:15:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:14:56):**  It's a dangerous work environment.  It's just a mini version of the big guys.  And so just to have a lot more people pile in with these smaller plants that are going  
**[0:15:06-0:15:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:15:06):**  to be just like the big guys except smaller, it's just going to be a whole lot more bankruptcies.  We haven't fixed a damn thing.  We have not fixed market access, free open and competitive markets that we have to have  
**[0:15:19-0:15:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:15:19):**  if we're going to restore any kind of level of income that's livable at the farm and ranch  gate and restore these rural communities back to some level of existence that can sustain  itself.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:15:32):**  So other than micro-scale processing plants, what are some things that the people that  are going to listen to this can do to help spur action?  Like get on the phone, call your rep, call your senators.  
**[0:15:52-0:16:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:15:52):**  You know, Brian, that's what we've been doing for 30 years to adapt a year.  We've tried everything.  We've litigated which we've never won.  
**[0:16:03-0:16:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:16:03):**  We've legislated, we won and then lose in rulemaking.  So in the end we never win.  We've never won in legislation.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:16:12):**  For example, the mandatory price reporting, the confidentiality clause that was added  to that just made secret all the preferential sweetheart deals that the capitalist of life  eaters are getting, the very same kind of confidentiality of NCBA one for the meeting  
**[0:16:31-0:16:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:16:31):**  and so we're in way worse shape than we've ever been.  We've lost it every single turn and so my solution is to build an alternative pathway  to the consumer which I've been doing now for 21 years and really been at this whole  
**[0:16:45-0:17:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:16:45):**  fight for 30 years.  And so building that alternative pathway to the consumer is what I have done but man,  it is hard and nobody should have to do that to be able to sell what they produce on our  
**[0:17:00-0:17:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:17:00):**  farms and ranches.  They should have a marketplace that rewards them fairly based on actual supply and demand.  That hasn't happened.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:17:09):**  So I think what we have to do…  And it's a living wage and that's really what gets me right now is you've got all  these people that have been demanding a living wage.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:17:25):**  Living wage for all.  But perversely, the higher minimum wage goes, the more money that's going to take out  of our pockets and the harder it's going to be for us to make a living, the harder  
**[0:17:37-0:17:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:17:37):**  it's going to be for us to hire any labor.  Brian you're absolutely right and that's why I've said for a long time, until you  have an economy that's fair, markets that are competitive and open, you can't be mandating  
**[0:17:52-0:18:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:17:52):**  these things because Walmart, all they have to do to pay the minimum wage is to pay less  to their suppliers, less to the cattle that are produced for their Creekstone partnership.  They just simply take the course of least resistance because one thing you can damn  
**[0:18:07-0:18:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:18:07):**  well bet is they're not going to take less executive compensation.  They're not going to lower the Walton family's return on their investment.  They are going to take it out of the course of least resistance and that is labor.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:18:22):**  Unless you raise the minimum wage and it's going to be their suppliers of raw materials  and products into those Walmart stores.  And so we just keep losing and losing and losing until we break up the abusive market  
**[0:18:39-0:18:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:18:39):**  power.  That's what we have to do and so I think we have to get behind the monopoly movement,  the anti monopoly movement in Washington and it's growing big.  
**[0:18:50-0:19:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:18:50):**  Klobuchar just wrote a book and I just finished reading it.  Unfortunately it doesn't mention the Cowboys, it doesn't mention the meat packers at all.  It does mention monopolies, a lot of monopolies.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:19:03):**  So she's on board, she's going to be an easy one to jump on onto a bill to break up or  some sort of policy to break up this monopoly power.  And then we've got Elizabeth Warren, we've got Cory Booker, we've got Mike Lee, we've  
**[0:19:18-0:19:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:19:18):**  got a bunch of these leaders now that are in both parties.  Thomas Massie.  Exactly.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:19:26):**  That no monopolies are bad.  And I'm just saying, let's put it to them.  That's all we can do right now.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:19:33):**  We can't litigate and win because the judges are all those rig and appointee, E-reg type  judges that simply don't believe in antitrust law enforcement.  If Congress has to rewrite some of these laws, they have to do it and they have to do it  
**[0:19:45-0:19:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:19:45):**  right now.  So I think we're in a pretty good position now to really make some change.  And of course the big meat packers weekly remind us of how urgent that is.  
**[0:19:56-0:20:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:19:56):**  It is amazing how brazen they've become.  And then what's really crazy is how much money Tyson makes even after paying all of these  settlement agreements for cheating in the market, for fixing the price of chicken and  
**[0:20:15-0:20:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:20:15):**  pork and all kinds of settlements.  If you go to their SEC reporting, I mean, it's all in there.  I mean the hundreds of millions of dollars that they're paying out in these settlement  
**[0:20:28-0:20:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:20:28):**  agreements, this is not where they pled guilty.  Hundreds of millions of dollars is peanuts.  That's right.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:20:35):**  But it's not where they pled guilty to anything.  So we haven't fixed anything.  They'll pay a fine in lieu of prosecution, in lieu of a plea, so they don't ever have  
**[0:20:45-0:21:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:20:45):**  to have any evidence discovery in court and they don't admit any guilt and it's just a  fine to the government.  But the really perverse thing is every time Tyson, JBS, Marfrig, Smithfield has to pay  
**[0:21:00-0:21:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:21:00):**  a fine, whose pocket does it come out of?  Comes right out of the producer's pocket because that's the course of least resistance.  So the government's going to fine them for screwing the producer and then the producer  
**[0:21:15-0:21:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:21:15):**  pays the fine.  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:21:19):**  So it's like the guy, JBS was stealing those cattle from that guy in Nebraska.  They fined JBS $50,000.  I mean they should have lost their grant of inspection for sure with USDA.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:21:32):**  That plant should not have been able to operate anymore under their ownership.  If you got caught stealing cattle, you'd probably get put out of business.  Absolutely would.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:21:40):**  I'd lose my grant of inspection, which would mean I'd be out of business.  Absolutely that is what happened.  But we give a pass to the corporation.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:21:48):**  So they plead, they don't even have to plead.  They work out a settlement agreement.  And this is where law enforcement is failless.  
**[0:21:58-0:22:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:21:58):**  And there was a really good book written here a few years ago called The Chicken Chick Club.  And basically the question was asked to these state attorneys general in a meeting, how  many of you have ever lost a case in regards to mostly antitrust work?  
**[0:22:19-0:22:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:22:19):**  And of course there were some hands that went up in the room that they had never lost a  case.  And so the statement was made, well you are then members of the Chicken Chick Club because  
**[0:22:33-0:22:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:22:33):**  you didn't file cases where you should have filed cases.  You only took slam dunks that you knew you couldn't lose.  And so you've failed as law enforcers to hold these monopolies and these bad actors accountable.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:22:50):**  But their prosecution rate is probably a performance metric on their evaluation sheet.  Exactly.  Yeah, that's right.  
**[0:22:59-0:23:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:22:59):**  That's right.  In fact, it was James Comey in this book that was asking the question.  And he was the one that said, James Comey, former attorney general.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:23:11):**  And he's the one that said, you're a member of the Chicken Chick Club.  In fact, you have done society no good.  You have not done your job.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:23:19):**  Well hello, it's been since the 80s, since we really enforced any of these antitrust  laws that should have protected the consumer and the producer.  Well now you just look at what's happening today with these hackers, the way they're  
**[0:23:34-0:23:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:23:34):**  paying for cattle and on the other hand, what they're selling meat for.  Never before have the producers and the consumers both been so damaged as they are today.  Even back in 1921 when we passed the Packers and Dockyards Act, which was specifically  
**[0:23:51-0:23:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:23:51):**  passed to protect producers.  And it just seems like they're laughing at us.  Yeah, they are.  
**[0:23:56-0:23:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:23:56):**  They are.  They're laughing.  They're slapping their leg.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:23:59):**  They are piling up money.  They're just laughing at us.  What they report as profits are highly, highly understated because when you're making that  
**[0:24:09-0:24:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:24:09):**  kind of money, don't you want to trade in for a new Gulfstream jet?  Maybe two or three of them?  Don't you want to increase those executive salaries and returns to shareholders and all  
**[0:24:19-0:24:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:24:19):**  that other stuff that maybe is going to reduce those reported profit numbers?  Yeah, because you don't want to pay taxes.  Don't want to look like greedy assholes.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:24:29):**  That's right.  So, but you know, we've got Farm Bureau, NCBA that showed up to meet with some of the other  cattle guys in Phoenix the other day.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:24:41):**  Let's see where that goes.  LMA was really the organizer of that gathering, but everybody right now is pushing the panic  button.  
**[0:24:50-0:25:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:24:50):**  And the only reason NCBA is even at the table is because they are scared to death they are  going to lose the checkoff.  And of course, if I could wave my magic wand that checkoff would be gone by right now.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:25:05):**  Let's talk about that for a few minutes.  What can we do?  How do we get rid of the checkoff?  
**[0:25:11-0:25:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:25:11):**  Well you got to have a referendum.  And that is so hard now because we've got so few producers left and so many producers  now are just so part of the problem.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:25:28):**  They've become suppliers on a captive basis or some relationship basis to where they're  getting a little better price or better deal than their neighbor.  And they're probably not, they don't want to rock the boat.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:25:43):**  So it's going to be really hard, I think.  But we've got to try.  We've got to try to get the petition.  
**[0:25:49-0:26:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:25:49):**  We've got to have the vote.  And then if it's like the pork checkoff, that doesn't mean you necessarily win.  Was it Ann Beneman that reversed the pork vote and said we're just not going to abide  
**[0:26:02-0:26:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:26:02):**  by it and we couldn't eliminate the pork checkoff back when we had that vote.  But what's it been, 35 years since we got a vote on the checkoff?  I didn't vote for it.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:26:13):**  I didn't either.  In fact, I was there in San Antonio and I wasn't even allowed in the room to vote.  I never even got a card.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:26:21):**  But they knew who we were.  And when I went up to get my voting card, they said, well, have you paid your fair share?  Well, I paid my dues to NCBA or NCA at that time.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:26:35):**  I said, I paid my dues.  No, no, no.  Have you paid your fair share?  
**[0:26:38-0:26:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:26:38):**  In other words, they wanted additional money from you if you own cattle, whatever it was  per head that they expected you to pay in.  And so they sorted out those people that were even allowed in the room.  
**[0:26:51-0:27:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:26:51):**  And then the way they conducted the vote, they made it very hard to vote against the  checkoff merger because you would stand out like a sore thumb and everybody would shame  you in the room like you're an idiot.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:27:06):**  You aren't very smart.  You don't know what you're doing.  And so there was that whole contingent in San Antonio that really never got to vote  
**[0:27:14-0:27:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:27:14):**  on the checkoff that was absolutely against the NCBA forming and the NCA and the checkoff  merging.  We'd already seen what happened in Kansas with the Kansas Livestock Association.  
**[0:27:27-0:27:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:27:27):**  They captured the state checkoff and they just ran with it and funded that Kansas Livestock  Association fully with big wages to the executives and fully in support of big managers.  They've been pretty quiet for the last 18 months, haven't they?  
**[0:27:46-0:27:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:27:46):**  Yeah, yeah, they have.  They have.  Suspiciously quiet for as much money as they're raking in.  
**[0:27:51-0:28:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:27:51):**  Yep.  Yeah, and then we end up with Mike Beame as Secretary of Agriculture in Kansas, you know,  former KLA.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:28:01):**  Now, how in the world did the governor make that mistake?  And now we're coming out with the Kansas Department of Health and Environment wanting to make  it easier to build hog factories.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:28:13):**  Closer to your house, closer to the school.  They're trying to reduce the separation of the big factory pig farms or whatever, chicken  farms, to where they can build them anywhere they want to build them.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:28:29):**  Why in the hell, and I doubt a Mike Beame deal as Secretary of Agriculture, he is a  big promoter of industrial agriculture, which has done nothing but make Kansas more like  Iowa.  
**[0:28:44-0:28:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:28:44):**  I mean, who wants to be like Iowa?  All they are is a big hog sewer.  I mean, it's turned into a mining operation where the big companies just come in and just  
**[0:28:56-0:29:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:28:56):**  strip mine your country, your state, your community.  Strip mine the soil.  The only thing behind is the manure.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:29:06):**  They strip mine the soil and then Dollar General shows up and we go down that rabbit trail  too.  Yep, we got a dollar store in St. Francis.  
**[0:29:14-0:29:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:29:14):**  I mean, a new one, a brand new one.  And it just so happens to be in the same location as the cafe was that went out of business.  Yeah, last time we talked, they just opened that.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:29:25):**  Yeah, yeah.  What a travesty.  How could a city council even allow that to happen?  
**[0:29:32-0:29:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:29:32):**  But so often, citizens don't know.  They just don't understand how bad that is for a community to enter into that secondhand  economy.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:29:42):**  I think people are starting to see.  I know I've had several people that have communicated with me since your last episode  came out, episode four, for those that haven't heard it.  
**[0:29:55-0:30:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:29:55):**  I've had several people communicate to me since then that they have stopped going to  Dollar General and Family Dollar and whatever other brand names they operate on.  Right.  
**[0:30:08-0:30:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:30:08):**  But you know, Brian, I was just thinking how could you tax that company so they wouldn't  come to your community?  And I'm thinking, well, you could raise their taxes, you could not pay them incentives,  
**[0:30:19-0:30:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:30:19):**  you could not give them land.  You wouldn't have to give them their ingress and egress at the cost of the community with  your highway construction and maybe a stoplight with an arrow.  
**[0:30:31-0:30:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:30:31):**  You can eliminate all that kind of stuff.  But here's the problem with the dollar stores is much of what they sell, they don't pay  anything for.  
**[0:30:40-0:30:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:30:40):**  It's kind of like that waste stream that comes out of the big box stores, the produce stream  that the big box stores give it away and get the tax deduction that gives them the same  kind of margins that they would have had had they sold it at the retail level.  
**[0:30:58-0:31:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:30:58):**  And so we've got to go after that tax benefit in giving food away.  So the dollar stores come to town and they're selling something basically that they haven't  even paid for or if they did it was at fire sale prices, it's very much reduced prices.  
**[0:31:15-0:31:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:31:15):**  And so even if you put a 50% tax on a dollar store, it wouldn't be nearly enough to offset  their advantage over local retailers.  I mean you just honestly got to ban them.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:31:29):**  You've got to say no.  That's an unfair, that is an unfair business structure that will not allow people playing  fairly to survive.  
**[0:31:40-0:32:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:31:40):**  And the problem here is that we've got these big box stores, these massive companies like  Walmart that have this enormous waste stream of product that comes out of their stores.  Maybe it aged out, maybe it's past its sell by date, maybe it's a company that went broke  
**[0:32:00-0:32:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:32:00):**  or maybe there was a truck on its way somewhere and it rolled over in the ditch.  That's the kind of stuff that ends up in these dollar stores.  And for us to support that economy is a travesty to the overall economy but in particular the  
**[0:32:15-0:32:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:32:15):**  small communities where those dollar stores are located.  But I think to really address it, you've got to break up the big box model.  You've got to tell the Walton family that enough is enough and you've got to break them  
**[0:32:29-0:32:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:32:29):**  up.  So how do we do that?  Well, it takes antitrust, it takes government, it takes a government to address the power  
**[0:32:37-0:32:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:32:37):**  of a big corporation.  I think it's important that we also need to say, or I need to say that if you don't want  to support that, quit spending your dollars there.  
**[0:32:51-0:33:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:32:51):**  If you don't like that and don't like the effects that those businesses have.  That's like talking to a Walmart shopper, trying to convince them not to shop at Walmart  is like trying to convince somebody to not order their steak well done.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:33:05):**  It's like trying to get a vegan to eat meat.  It is not going to happen.  It's got to come from government making the markets fair, antitrust law enforcement.  
**[0:33:17-0:33:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:33:17):**  Man, there's a bunch of good books.  Zephyr Teachout, Buried Land, Amy Klobuchar, we've got Monopoly Suck.  There are some really good books and they've got the recipe and the formula in them on  
**[0:33:35-0:33:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:33:35):**  exactly how to go about this.  Now what we've got to do is get Congress to enact the new laws and the rules to where  we can make that happen.  
**[0:33:45-0:34:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:33:45):**  Because it is a national security issue to lose your ability to feed yourself.  We lost that 20 years ago and it's time to rebuild it.  Brian, we talked about what we can do and I talk about rebuilding the food system and  
**[0:34:03-0:34:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:34:03):**  I like to end up with that public market that's owned by the public to where we can have all  this food stuff going on in this public market.  That is as important of infrastructure, more important infrastructure than bridges and  
**[0:34:19-0:34:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:34:19):**  highways.  It's the pathway from the farm to the table.  And that is the most important infrastructure that we can possibly build because the farm  
**[0:34:30-0:34:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:34:30):**  and the ranch is where wealth is created.  If we move our wealth creators off of their land, we aren't going to have the goose anymore  that laid the golden egg.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:34:41):**  It's going to be gone.  Additionally, you're not going to have the steward that took care of that environment,  that took care of that grass, that rotationally grazed and sequestered carbon and kept streams  
**[0:34:52-0:35:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:34:52):**  clean.  That person goes away and their offspring, those children that grew up on that place  are never going to have the opportunity to come back.  
**[0:35:02-0:35:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:35:02):**  Bill Gates will own the land and you will be driving a tractor and a spray rig operation  for Bill Gates.  Now, that is not an agriculture that I will participate in and I guarantee you my kids  
**[0:35:15-0:35:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:35:15):**  and my grandkids won't participate in it.  Bill Gates isn't going to have people in his tractors.  He's going to have them.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:35:22):**  There will be people in those tractors and there'll be those kids that go to our land  grant universities like K-State, Colorado State, Oklahoma State that have been taught  that industrial agriculture is the way we're going to feed the world and by God, get in  
**[0:35:37-0:35:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:35:37):**  that tractor because it's really fun to run that GPS.  It's crop protection.  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:35:42-0:35:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:35:42):**  That's a weird, that's kind of a weird way to put it, isn't it?  Crop protection.  Yeah.  
**[0:35:48-0:35:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:35:48):**  Because they poison the soil.  Yeah, and feed more money into their Monsanto.  That doesn't make sense.  
**[0:35:54-0:36:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:35:54):**  I'm in the crop protection industry.  No, you're in the industry of death.  You spray poison on a very large scale.  
**[0:36:04-0:36:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:36:04):**  That's right.  That's right.  So, I see an economy, an agricultural and food economy where a lot more things go through  
**[0:36:12-0:36:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:36:12):**  animals like a cow eats the grass, has a calf and we eat meat but it's done right.  It's done to where the country and the land gets better and better.  So, you know, I want to see the CRP acres being grazed but before we can do that, we've  
**[0:36:26-0:36:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:36:26):**  got to stop the imports and we've got to have competitive markets.  Yes, sir.  You know, what if we could graze in a well-managed system 21 million acres of CRP and give a  
**[0:36:39-0:36:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:36:39):**  bunch of young people a chance to get some land and to get in the cattle business but  don't do it until there's a market because until then, it's nothing but a fool's game  and a way to lose all your money, all your family and friends' money, all of grandma's  
**[0:36:54-0:37:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:36:54):**  money.  You can't do it until we have a market and I would argue we haven't had a market for  20 or 30 years.  
**[0:37:01-0:37:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:37:01):**  It's been a price.  It's been a price that's been agreed upon by a cartel of big meat packers, retailers  and food service companies.  
**[0:37:11-0:37:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:37:11):**  Yep.  So, we got to kind of wrap up.  What we got to do?  
**[0:37:17-0:37:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:37:17):**  We got to keep pressure on our legislators, our senators, our reps in Washington and in  your state house.  We got to sign the petition.  
**[0:37:27-0:37:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:37:27):**  We got to try the referendum.  We got to try it.  And of course, you got to shake the hand that feeds you.  
**[0:37:34-0:37:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:37:34):**  I think that's the most critical thing to bring more of the consumer food dollar share  back to the producers.  Rebuild those local regional food systems and where it's a direct connection and Tyson  
**[0:37:51-0:38:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:37:51):**  doesn't get the play.  Yep.  There's got to be some change and I hope it's coming and I hope it's coming soon.  
**[0:38:01-0:38:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:38:01):**  Mike, my friend has been…  Hey, Brian, I don't know if we might mention that on my blog, MikeCalacreat.com, go there  and look at that Minnesota Farmers Union presentation I did where I lay that out, the idea of this  
**[0:38:15-0:38:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:38:15):**  alternative food system, which I've already done with Ranch Foods Direct.  But if we could do that on a little larger scale, then the packers, their challenge of  explaining why they have to make so much money would become much, much more difficult if  
**[0:38:30-0:38:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:38:30):**  more people just knew how many dollars they're stealing.  So have your folks check out that presentation of the Minnesota Farmers Union.  I will try to find that and put that in the show notes.  
**[0:38:43-0:38:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:38:43):**  Today is Tuesday and I'm going to just go ahead and release this on Thursday because  it's good, it's current and we got to keep talking about it.  We got to get loud and we have to encourage others to get loud and encourage change in  
**[0:38:58-0:39:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:38:58):**  our food systems.  I agree.  Okay.  
**[0:39:02-0:39:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:39:02):**  Mike, my friend, it's been a pleasure.  Thanks buddy.  Hey, Brian.  
**[0:39:08-0:39:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:39:08):**  Thanks for having me.  Thanks for having me, Brian.  Talk to you later.  
**[0:39:11-0:39:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-With-Mike-Callicrate--Markets--Current-events-and-more-e1154i3#t=0:39:11):**  Yep.  Enjoy the rest of your day, sir.  You too.

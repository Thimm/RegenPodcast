I've got a special treat lined up for you today.  A couple weeks ago, I went over to visit my friends Josh and Gwen, their daughter Josie  
**[0:00:55-0:01:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:00:55):**  Hoy on their beautiful ranch, the Flying W in the Flint Hills.  The real reason I went there was to hang out, meet Bob Kenford and learn some stockmanship  from him.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:01:05):**  And this is a recording of a great after dinner conversation that we had.  The seven of us, myself, Bob Kenford, Josh, Josie and Gwen Hoy, Jake Jacobs and David  Stackley.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:01:16):**  We were all sitting outside after having dinner.  Long great day on horseback on the beautiful Flying W. I apologize for some of the background  noise including the dogs and the phone notifications.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:01:28):**  Just couldn't be helped.  Like I said, we were sitting outside and it was a beautiful evening in the heart of the  Flint Hills.  
**[0:01:32-0:01:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:01:32):**  We had a great conversation and I hope you guys enjoy it.  What a saying.  The low end player is really good.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:01:39):**  Some people take it to the extreme, to the detrimental side.  And the situation that we're down in, you got to be feeding some sort of.  I mean, there's just been no two ways about it.  
**[0:01:53-0:02:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:01:53):**  And this guy that this friend of mine is taking care of cattle for.  They know a lot of older cows are pouring in as they can scrounge.  But all there is is a death of both of us that's got like probably a minus 5% protein.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:02:08):**  And he's not feeding them anything.  And he's got 200 and something of them.  And well, feed them a bale of hay a week and put out a cub.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:02:22):**  And then he goes up and the bike starts going up and putting out three bales at a time,  twice a week.  The guy's getting upset about it.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:02:27):**  And then he goes out and he can't find his cows.  And that's all he's doing is he's going ahead and he's feeding for them, checking the water.  And they went ahead and they gathered and they just did a quick gather.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:02:40):**  And you know, the four aunties, he's raising rope and steers.  So they get down there and had all their cows, but there were short-minded cows.  And I was going on trying to save the bike short-minded cows.  
**[0:02:49-0:03:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:02:49):**  Well, the point of laying out there is dead.  You know, because really he wouldn't fed them.  And there would be cows sitting on that hay dead because they gorged and it just.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:03:00):**  And then there were probably some that started the death that never got a bite of it.  Can't eat them if there's a dead cow laying there.  So I'm going to get it out of the way.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:03:23):**  See, back to my original question, what was your favorite place to work at?  Right here.  All right.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:03:30):**  Maybe we'll buy it.  Here's your dog.  Here's your dog.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:03:33):**  Oh man, I don't know because I really like every place that I've been.  As long as I'm horseback and I'm getting through cattle, I'm pretty heavy hamper.  I don't need a whole lot.  
**[0:03:54-0:04:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:03:54):**  That's your happy place?  Yeah, that's my happy place.  Horseback and cattle, it's like you hit times a year when I was in the feedlot.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:04:04):**  And I mean, oh man, I forgot how bad those smelled until I went in there the other day.  But when they started hitting and they're going 60, 70 hours a week and everybody's  getting tired and cranky because they're working all these hours, it was like, okay, I'm pulling  
**[0:04:21-0:04:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:04:21):**  up to 130 dead cows a day.  And everybody's kind of pulling that same pretty close to that.  And so you're having out of your section every day, you're pulling between 200 and 300 cows,  
**[0:04:35-0:04:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:04:35):**  which means you're having to do go home, which means you get to go and you get to sort of  back into their, into which alleys, then you get to go down and you get to sort of back  in the deal.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:04:44):**  And I just eat it up.  I love the hell out of it.  I wouldn't get tired.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:04:48):**  I'd be charged up.  Or I get grumpiest when we're only working 25 or 30 hours a week and you're just, you  know, nothing sick and you know, you're just going through there.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:04:57):**  That's no fun.  But man, when you're pulling cattle and you're doing that, I mean, that's kind of always  what I look for that.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:05:04):**  You know, and we were doing, we were doing three natural heat cycles and we were doing  1000 to 1500 acre pastures.  So you were pulling out of that big area?  
**[0:05:20-0:05:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:05:20):**  No, you had, they had like, they'd have a dam down here and they'd have a breeding pin.  They'd have another dam down there and they got another breeding pin.  And you know, they have three breeding pins there and you know, you'd have one circle,  
**[0:05:35-0:05:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:05:35):**  somebody else have another circle and all the circles kind of overlap a little bit.  And you'd go out there and you'd ride through and you'd go ahead and pin your hot cows.  And when you get down to, you know, first cycle, they kind of, to me, they set it up  
**[0:05:51-0:06:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:05:51):**  backwards.  We got all this up on the first cycle.  The first day with your pin on those hot cows, it's a little bit tough.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:06:01):**  A little, a little bit, not bad.  They set it off, they've got our, you know, pins coming up and they got a ring coming  off around them.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:06:08):**  So you can kind of go by them and do that little fade and they drop right in.  You know, you try going in from the other way and try to push them in there, go by there.  But then the next day that you go to come through, that night, when do you go to go  
**[0:06:21-0:06:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:06:21):**  in?  Those cows are standing up there ready to get bred.  It smells like hot cows.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:06:26):**  And you got a group of hot cows and they see that pin and they just go straight for it.  And you pin down those pins themselves.  The second cycle, they are, instead of pulling, you know, 20 head, you know, everybody's pulling  
**[0:06:45-0:06:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:06:45):**  20, 30 head.  So then it drops down and you're only pulling between five to 12 right around in there,  depending on how that first day went up.  
**[0:06:57-0:07:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:06:57):**  And there are two.  They're hot, they've got other hot cows with them.  They don't pay any attention to their calf.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:07:05):**  But then you get down to the third cycle.  You're getting one a day, two a day.  You don't spot them by the gomer bulls, you spot them by the mass of bull calves up there  
**[0:07:18-0:07:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:07:18):**  mobbing that hot cow.  So she's kind of really, you know, she's had enough.  And on those, you get up there and you got 50 to 100 head of calves up there mobbing  
**[0:07:30-0:07:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:07:30):**  one cow.  And you have to find her calf, you pin her calf, you get away from all those.  It gets to be pretty interesting.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:07:38):**  It gets to be pretty interesting.  It gets to be pretty wild.  But it was, for me, it was fun because that was all the talent.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:07:45):**  And you're horsebacking your working cows.  You know, and everybody else is just getting grumpy and I'd be getting tired.  But you know, I'm still having fun with it.  
**[0:07:54-0:08:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:07:54):**  You know, I mean, that's why, for me, that's why you get into this business to begin with  is because you like working with the animals.  You like working with nature and everything.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:08:08):**  And people forget when they start hitting the management deal.  You know, they want to manage and they want to manage that guy that's out there and telling  them what to do.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:08:19):**  Well, he's doing his job.  Anytime he spends out there with those cows, he's making you money.  You know, you go out there.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:08:26):**  When I went to Babb and that's another place I really liked it.  You know, they're on that back foot reservation.  Love the people and got along with everybody.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:08:38):**  But when I first got there and they were having a rip, we had crews ripping out fence, we  had crews putting in fence, we designed fence, we had crews on there.  And I was bouncing around on the cowboys, I'm bouncing around on all this and I'll go  
**[0:08:49-0:08:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:08:49):**  for three or four weeks about seeing cows.  And I kept telling this guy that I was working, you know, that was, I was a cow boss and I  had a guy that wasn't managing, he was operating.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:08:58):**  And I kept going, I got to get out to those cows.  And he kept going, no, no, no, you don't need to do that.  You don't need to do that.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:09:06):**  And we got home one night because they didn't have housing, they were renting a trailer  for us off the ranch.  And we had a message from the neighbor, you got a real sick calf down, you know, right  
**[0:09:16-0:09:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:09:16):**  by our fence.  So, we kind of had directions down there.  So, they go, well, yeah, maybe you better go down there and doctor that and kind of  
**[0:09:22-0:09:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:09:22):**  look around.  I went into that pasture, that one was dead.  It was, I can't remember because it's been like over 20 years, but it was two or three  
**[0:09:32-0:09:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:09:32):**  more dead.  And I doctored damn near 30 head.  And they were sick, sick.  
**[0:09:39-0:10:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:09:39):**  And so, there's two, three, four dead that they would have gotten $900 a piece off of.  Plus those other ones that went from making a $900 bull cow to they had to get cut and  went for a 48, that was a year that was 48 cents a pound on steers.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:10:01):**  And they're only paying me $1,100 a month.  I mean, that, if I was just saving that right there would have paid for three months of  me just camping on them cows.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:10:12):**  But people don't, you know, they don't.  Did they realize it afterwards or not?  Yeah, yeah, he kind of, yeah, okay, well, maybe you do need to get through there.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:10:23):**  But the organic, I know you probably run into that in a few days.  You can go in there and people have cows come in and they're healthy and they stay healthy  and they gain good.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:10:34):**  And then you'll get people that come in and it'll be the same ranch coming in every year.  And they bring in stuff that they just turn out into the mountain, turn out on the mountain.  And they go back down in their hand or doing whatever they do.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:10:46):**  They go up in the fall and they gather these cattle.  You got crippled cows, you got blind cows.  And you bring them into the lot, they're getting sick.  
**[0:10:56-0:11:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:10:56):**  They're not, you know, they don't do good for a long time before they start gaining.  And you know, they're, whoever's buying those cattle, they're buying them cheap.  You know, they're buying them cheap.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:11:08):**  They're cutting their own, they don't even know that they're throwing that money away.  It just, it just, it frustrates me because when I go to work for somebody, I want them  to make money.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:11:19):**  No, that's, that's the new way of thinking.  You don't want anybody making money.  You're just, money just appears.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:11:22):**  Well, I'm not real right.  We've been doing it wrong all these years.  Do you guys are making money?  
**[0:11:40-0:11:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:11:40):**  As I say, wow.  That's on the table.  I was like, what?  
**[0:11:44-0:11:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:11:44):**  Ranching for profit?  What?  What?  
**[0:11:47-0:12:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:11:47):**  Oxymoron is just cowboy with a bunch of steroids.  When I was a prat, let's see, the manager told us he's sick.  All you need to pull is the sickest one out of each of them.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:12:13):**  The one that's going to die tonight.  It's a little late, isn't it?  Well, I'm not God to start with.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:12:23):**  I don't know whether they're going to die tonight.  Why not?  We would have these meetings every three months and he'd tell us what a great job we've done,  
**[0:12:35-0:12:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:12:35):**  you know, in the past year, the last week and so and everything and then he'd go butt.  And that's when that shit hit the fan.  Yeah.  
**[0:12:44-0:12:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:12:44):**  He would bring up stuff from people that hadn't been there for five years.  Oh, yeah.  Really?  
**[0:12:51-0:12:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:12:51):**  Yes.  Well, I did none of it.  I mean, yeah, some of the same people were there, but these guys were gone.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:12:58):**  Like the ones that would go down in the 600 Valley and practice team roping after everybody  went home.  That would be a negative, wouldn't it?  
**[0:13:06-0:13:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:13:06):**  Well, stuff like that.  I went down to Missouri one day from there a bad and I come back and the guy worked with  me and this is they decide, well, now they need a manager because that first winter we  
**[0:13:23-0:13:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:13:23):**  had 750 small round bales and we had somewhere around 1,450, 1,500 cows and heifers plus  40 bulls and they retained all the calves, you know, they retained 700 some odd calves  keeping them on the ranch with 750 small round bales.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:13:44):**  Now, the guy that was operating it, this pretty sharp guy and he actually went up to Canada  and had it arranged.  It would have been $25 a ton holding, right?  
**[0:13:57-0:14:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:13:57):**  That's cheap.  I mean, that's cheap.  In the late 1990s, that's cheap.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:14:03):**  So this guy's going, oh no, no, no, I drive from Carroll County where this thing's open.  You don't need all that hay.  You'll see.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:14:13):**  You'll see.  Well, they had a kind of a screw up on the deal where it was supposed to be, they were  only buying the cows that were exportable to Montana.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:14:26):**  But it turned out they had a bunch of those cows that had never been bang vaccinated.  But they told me, oh, you bought the whole thing.  And then they charged them like $24 a month back in the 90s to keep those cows there.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:14:40):**  Well, I got to go from Montana down there.  I was going to wean the calves and, you know, sort of the ones that were supposed to be  going to leave the things in.  
**[0:14:51-0:15:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:14:51):**  The other ones would go through the sale ring.  And I got down there and I'm going to tell you what, the range is going sideways.  And those cows generally they were, and they're guys that was like, got them in and had two  
**[0:15:11-0:15:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:15:11):**  cows that they could go on the trailer and they got on the scales.  They would not go any further.  And her guy is going down the alley with the truck and he pulls up to the scale to get  
**[0:15:26-0:15:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:15:26):**  them to go over.  And we got the one on, I got the gate closed on her so she couldn't come back out.  And when he did that, he flattened both tires on that pickup.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:15:36):**  So it's like, crap, you know, the sales getting ready to start.  I got to get up there and they were going to charge, they were going to charge, you  know, like a dollar or two dollars a head to run the cows through the brake test.  
**[0:15:48-0:15:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:15:48):**  So I called into the sale barn and they were charging like a buck and a half to run them  through there.  Okay, we're going to do them through there.  
**[0:15:56-0:16:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:15:56):**  Well, the storm's in there and these cows are not, they're not getting the brake checked  because nobody's showing up.  So they're just going through the ring.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:16:08):**  And they were short about 20, 30 head, but we go ahead, they run through the ring.  That woman sold those cows for $750 charged $24 a month for like five months to hold them  down there and then bought them back for $350 a head because it could close the bull.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:16:33):**  So the other ones we got, they got those in and they had just opened that Packerland hill  plant there in Borden and I just ran those cows down there.  You know what?  
**[0:16:47-0:16:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:16:47):**  I think I got $750 for them.  I broke even on at least the cost of the cow, taking them down there and then holding them  back up.  
**[0:16:56-0:17:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:16:56):**  But I was, but anyway, I'm down there dealing with that.  Mitch calls me up and he says, boy, you're lucky.  He says, we got four foot of snow last night.  
**[0:17:06-0:17:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:17:06):**  And we were only feeding those cows nine pounds of hay a day and we were out biking together.  So now he's paying $250 US to get hay.  Oh my goodness.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:17:25):**  I mean, it just, I mean that winter was just a stinkin' wreck.  And I was telling him when I got back, I said, you know, we're needing to feed, we're needing  to feed.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:17:36):**  And then he gets to where we start feeding a little bit more.  And he calls me into the house there on Christmas Eve and he's got his whole family there.  He's going to give me his bonus.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:17:47):**  And I jumped down his throat with both feet.  I said, well, it's almost too late to start feeding them, but we need to start feeding  these damn cows 30 pounds of hay a day at least.  
**[0:17:56-0:18:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:17:56):**  And I said, and if you don't, I said, even if you start doing that, we're going to have  cows being born dead.  We're going to have cows dying trying to cow.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:18:06):**  We're going to have cows dying, you know, just being weak and dying a couple of days  after.  And we have all of that.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:18:11):**  And did you start feeding him or not?  Did you start feeding him then?  Did you start feeding him?  
**[0:18:18-0:18:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:18:18):**  Yeah.  He finally went ahead and he, you know, he did it.  His family was there.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:18:22):**  And after I left his family, go, you know, he knows what he's talking about.  You know, maybe we ought to listen to him.  So they started feeding more and you know, that was the hardest one that they've had  
**[0:18:36-0:18:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:18:36):**  in bad Montana in 75 years.  That is 96, 97, 97, 98.  It was hard all across.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:18:45):**  It was hard all across here.  Was there snow then in the winter?  Well it snowed and then it would chin up and it would get down and you got water running  
**[0:18:57-0:19:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:18:57):**  around in the snow and then drop back down to 40 below.  And when we started counting, we had six inches of ice around the house.  Well, I got my little bill, a shoe and a horse and a lice and that's all I'm standing up,  
**[0:19:11-0:19:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:19:11):**  you know, a real sharp jaw.  The thing is, is they had 125 cows that I wanted to call off.  I didn't want to turn their mouths fast.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:19:24):**  I mean, they were just, cows were, they had these humongous cows.  The only thing that we had to pull, oh no, no, no, no, no, but we have like 120 open  cows running with them.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:19:37):**  So they're up around there and all that ice.  And when a cow, you know, goes into labor, progesterone level drops and those cows, if  they were cycling, would think that these cows are coming into heat and they start riding  
**[0:19:57-0:20:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:19:57):**  and they plunk down and it was clipped in the calves.  And we're sitting there one night and the guy that was operating, his wife's been there  and she's, you know, doing bobcats with the kids.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:20:12):**  I just pulled one upside down one.  I'm working on another one, about two more in back of me.  I mean, this is just like a sibling line and her husband and this other guy comes in and  
**[0:20:24-0:20:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:20:24):**  they holler, we've got two more backwards ones for you.  And I just looked at her and said, well, how much you want to make a bet when they're both  upside down?  
**[0:20:30-0:20:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:20:30):**  She says, I'm not betting.  She says, I just checked the calves and we're going to see, you know, books for the last  24 hours.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:20:36):**  And before these, you'd already pulled eight.  So there's eight and then 12, 14 head and 24 hours upside down calves.  Upside down?  
**[0:20:47-0:21:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:20:47):**  No, that's pretty, once you get the hang of it, it's not that bad.  The first one or two, you know, you're kind of, you're kind of scratching your head about  this, but you got to take it and like the picking spring will ring in it.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:21:00):**  Okay.  You put it around the back of their head and through the middle of that.  And then, because once you get everything straightened out, they're so weak, your head  
**[0:21:08-0:21:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:21:08):**  will fall back.  So you got to kind of keep that up, but you've got to reach in the calf and you got to cross  it and then kind of keep a hand in there where you can keep crossing and switch your hands  
**[0:21:18-0:21:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:21:18):**  where you can roll them over like that.  And then you put on your change and everything.  The bad thing, you know, I'm kind of short and those cows are thinking about it here.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:21:29):**  And you get in there and they drop down on their knees and you think they're just praying  for the calf to come out.  And they shift their weight and they would have a foot on each one of your feet, your  
**[0:21:42-0:21:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:21:42):**  upper elbows with your arms crossed in the cow.  There ain't no place you can go.  You got to just sit there and wait for them to shift so that you can go back to work on  
**[0:21:51-0:22:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:21:51):**  them.  I mean, it was, but we went back in and this was just two weeks into calving season.  I don't know, I don't know how many bucks.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:22:00):**  And this was a daily thing all through the calving season.  I have at least one.  And at the end they wanted to, you know, well, you want to go back and count, see how many  
**[0:22:11-0:22:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:22:11):**  of those you did.  No.  At that time, no.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:22:14):**  At this time, man, it'd be interesting to know because that's like, that's a book of  record.  So again, what caused that?  
**[0:22:28-0:22:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:22:28):**  These cows were on ice.  They had open cows in there.  And yeah, I mean, this is just the way there were horse and the management on us.  
**[0:22:37-0:22:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:22:37):**  And when the progesterone drops, any cows coming in heat and start riding them because  it all of a sudden they smell different and they slam down on that ice and it puts cattle.  It was, and then he gets, he gets this right damn idea that I don't know where my money's  
**[0:22:55-0:23:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:22:55):**  going.  It couldn't be in that $250 a tonne.  Hey, that runs away fast.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:23:03):**  So he comes up with this right idea.  He wants to start keeping the time card, write down everything we're doing.  And I thought, I said, John, I don't want to know.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:23:12):**  You don't want to know.  Oh, I'd rather have you have me that soon.  He goes for two weeks and he comes back and I was averaging 120 hours a week.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:23:24):**  And I mean, everything was documented.  There was no barking around.  You take off the time that you go in for your half an hour for lunch and then come back  
**[0:23:32-0:23:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:23:32):**  at 120 hours a week.  And we lost, worst cavity I've ever done.  We lost 10 percent.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:23:39):**  Or no, we lost almost 20 percent.  Okay.  You know what the fact was?  
**[0:23:46-0:23:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:23:46):**  Neighbors that worked in that, they spent their whole life in that country.  That one that was so damn hurt that some of them lost over 40 percent.  We were busting our lungs to get, you know.  
**[0:23:57-0:24:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:23:57):**  Yeah.  Well, yeah, but see that was on that.  I did one when, first place I worked at in Montana, they bought a bunch of heifers and  
**[0:24:10-0:24:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:24:10):**  I was supposed to get them until the end of February.  It started the 10th of January.  Oh, there you go.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:24:15):**  Yeah.  I was the only one there.  And, you know, you're having to go.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:24:18):**  You're going 24 hours a day, you know.  Lay down four hours, get them checked out, check out, and then all day you're doing stuff.  And then you get, you get a capitalist down, you know, a capitalist down.

**[0:24:31-0:24:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:24:31):**  And I actually put in a 70 hour day.  And the thing was, is it was white muscle.  You know, my boss was doing it, he was a college professor, did a sabbatical in New York.  
**[0:24:50-0:25:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:24:50):**  And he couldn't get ahold of his wife.  And, you know, somebody to get him.  And I just, I find, I knew what it was because I had been posting them.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:25:00):**  And I had four calves down.  And I called the vet.  I said, okay, he's got this new white muscle disease.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:25:07):**  I said, does it have Selenium in it?  He goes, yes, it does.  How much is it?  
**[0:25:11-0:25:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:25:11):**  Five dollars a bottle.  Well, it's a hundred mile round trip to the vet.  Well, I went ahead and I did that.  
**[0:25:14-0:25:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:25:14):**  I got that five dollar bottle of medicine.  And I didn't lose a calf after that, you know.  And I had like a 98 percent, but I didn't lose a calf after that.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:25:17):**  So, I got a new white muscle.  I got a new white muscle.  I got a new white muscle.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:25:20):**  I got a new white muscle.  I got a new white muscle.  I got a new white muscle.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:25:23):**  I got a new white muscle.  I didn't lose a calf after that.  I got my butt chewed.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:25:28):**  Because I didn't get authorized to go get that.  Thinking on your own.  Yeah.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:25:33):**  It just, and it was effective.  It wasn't just a fun trip.  That's a great part.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:25:36):**  Yeah, it was just, and the thing is, is the house had burned down.  That's funny itself because we went to town on New Year's Day and they bought this, about  you know, your, all the Chinese proverbs and all sayings and everything.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:25:58):**  And they're saying, well, you know, Chinese say that your luck for the year is determined  by the altitude of the first bird to see.  Well, we're in Montana.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:26:05):**  We're driving home.  We're looking up in the air.  And then I got to hit the brakes because there's three bald eagles flying off of a dead deer  
**[0:26:11-0:26:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:26:11):**  all the time.  Three days later, the house burned down.  You know, it's kind of funny to look at that.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:26:14):**  That was a hard one because we went into a summer home that didn't have any eagles.  And it was dropping down to 45 below.  I'm assuming your water was just off.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:26:32):**  No, we had, what we did is we put, we had two kerosene heaters that we put in the bathroom  and under the kitchen sink to keep the night storm.  It was tough.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:26:46):**  But I survived.  Yeah.  You got a good story.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:26:49):**  Yeah, I got a good story.  What age were you at that time, Bob?  Oh, about 26 or 27.  
**[0:26:52-0:27:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:26:52):**  And it, you know, I just have a propensity for being able to go into a place that's going  to have a management deuce wreck.  And then I get to try to do whatever I can to make it be the least amount possible.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:27:14):**  And, you know, it's like it takes you off at the time, but that shit's where it all  works.  You know, you learn a lot of things.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:27:24):**  If everything's working fine, you don't learn there as much as you have the wreck.  And if you stay in one place your whole life, what do you say in one place your whole life?  And you're like, okay, you've been here your whole life.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:27:39):**  Yeah.  Basically working kind of the same place.  But the more places you get out to and that the more experience you have in it, the more  
**[0:27:47-0:27:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:27:47):**  little things you pick up.  And it's like, when I was younger, I'd cuss if I might have to move, I'd cuss.  But now I look at it as a little bit of an experience.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:27:59):**  If I hadn't been through all of that, I'd be here right now.  I'm one of them ranchers up there.  You know, I'd be happy with, I enjoy loads going through this.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:28:04):**  You know, I don't know how much I can do.  I'm not a big fan of it.  Well, you've got to wonder because I don't know how much but it will enjoy going to the  
**[0:28:13-0:29:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:28:13):**  he didn't act like he really didn't act.  And I really, it's like, I wish everybody had learned.  But at the same time, I know that not everybody's going to learn.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:29:04):**  Everybody will pick up little numbers.  And you have people that just don't pick up a damn thing.  I don't know if that means I'm a bad teacher or it's a bad school.  
**[0:29:15-0:29:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:29:15):**  Or I don't figure out how to connect to that person.  Sometimes I just think there's some people that just, but they're too afraid to experiment  with anything.  
**[0:29:24-0:29:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:29:24):**  Yeah, yeah.  This is an experimental deal and not even when it's set up right, sometimes it doesn't  work.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:29:32):**  Yeah.  I mean, it may not result may not be so many variables.  Yeah.  
**[0:29:38-0:29:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:29:38):**  Well, there's so many variables.  Those cows.  Okay.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:29:41):**  You started out with those lawnmowers and we could have done something with that, but  it's like, okay, we need something a little bit slower that we can go in there and see  what's going on and then have work.  
**[0:29:54-0:30:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:29:54):**  So then we switch over to those other ones.  And there was, they just had nothing.  Till Ethan stepped in there and that still amazes me.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:30:04):**  I mean, Brian went in there a foot and they worked for him, but they were still kind of  dead.  But Ethan stepped in there and I mean, it was just a total shame.  
**[0:30:12-0:30:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:30:12):**  I think that he's probably got a water gallon in there that, you know, you never see it  out of me.  Yeah.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:30:19):**  He's not very expressive.  Well, that's their thing.  He's not a little expressive with his body.  
**[0:30:22-0:30:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:30:22):**  Yeah.  He just kind of there.  Yeah, he's been kind of there, but he's putting off some sort of a necklaces.  
**[0:30:31-0:30:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:30:31):**  And I told him in the cabinet, it's like, well, if they got some life to them, they  still got some life to them.  But if they're like, you know, really wild, I'll sit in there and they'll start calming  
**[0:30:51-0:31:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:30:51):**  down.  And doing what I'm going to do.  And they'll come around.  
**[0:31:00-0:31:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:31:00):**  But then, okay, even though they were slow, they were kind of, don't get it slap side  or whatever, and not responsive.  At least you kind of got an idea of the move.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:31:11):**  Then when we went out there, you could, when I was doing something like Josie did that  one move on that, on going down that side, that was slick because she's going down there  and that cow was getting, it was going to sell out.  
**[0:31:22-0:31:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:31:22):**  All she did is just move her horse like a half a step out and that cow just turned around  the front and went backwards.  That's how close to the edge it was.  
**[0:31:33-0:31:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:31:33):**  Yeah.  You got to be there.  There was back when I was training horses, this guy wanted me to make an English horse  
**[0:31:41-0:31:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:31:41):**  on one of her areas.  English horses like horse horses, they want to pick a horse.  And this guy does this video, she wanted me to watch and he's had all these world championships  
**[0:31:51-0:32:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:31:51):**  and I'm just, I'm ready to throw up half of it in his closing state.  A truly great park horse at the edge of its performance, at the peak of its performance  is on the edge of disaster.  
**[0:32:08-0:32:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:32:08):**  You know, and it's like, you don't have to do that.  Why do you have to do that to get something that you can, that this horse is supposed  to be naturally going to do?  
**[0:32:17-0:32:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:32:17):**  And I told her, okay, I'll do this.  I'll do this.  I'm not going to do that.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:32:22):**  So she goes, well, okay.  And I had the horse on her foot and this man had her qualified for regional.  He wasn't interested in me because, you know, I had two horses qualified for regional and  
**[0:32:35-0:32:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:32:35):**  I had another horse or another horse more qualified for regional.  But no, they're not going to pay attention to you at regional because you know, you're  nobody.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:32:43):**  Right.  So I went ahead and what I did is I took a long sodge whip and I'm going down and just  timing it.  
**[0:32:53-0:33:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:32:53):**  When that foot's ready to come off the ground, I was just flipping it with that sodge whip.  Well, it picked it up.  Well, one starts, the other one started following through and in about 30, 45 days, that horse  
**[0:33:05-0:33:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:33:05):**  is picking them up, setting them down, picking them up, setting them down.  And she thought that was really great.  So we'll watch this.  
**[0:33:10-0:33:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:33:10):**  And you know, you're riding them on a tighter rein and your hand's in a different position.  I go and I just dropped them reins, threw them out.  She went into a good little pleasure horse job.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:33:22):**  So she takes me to nationals.  She's watching this and she says, you know, I wish I would have let you have you do that  with that horse faster and let you take them.  
**[0:33:30-0:33:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:33:30):**  She says, you would have been in the top 10 in English.  Had both.  Both classes.  
**[0:33:36-0:33:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:33:36):**  Both with the same horse doing two completely different things.  But these cows are just like the horses.  You know, you can be working them where you're always on the brink of disaster or you can  
**[0:33:48-0:34:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:33:48):**  do it where they can understand it.  And that's what we're doing here is we're going down.  And when we go down there and one of those cows starts getting up and it's looking for  
**[0:34:00-0:34:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:34:00):**  an escape hole, you're right on the brink of disaster.  You could race with just that little slight move.  They understand that and they go by.  
**[0:34:09-0:34:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:34:09):**  And that gets bills over time.  Exactly.  It gets easy.  
**[0:34:13-0:34:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:34:13):**  It goes over time where you can see something back there a hundred yards and I mean, once  you get them going, they're going to come anyways.  But you bill to them, if they're a hundred yards back, by the time you get 50 yards back  
**[0:34:25-0:34:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:34:25):**  going to the low for a long trot, they'll pick up their tails and they'll put a knot  in it and they'll go catch up with everybody.  You know, that's not happening to them.  
**[0:34:35-0:34:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:34:35):**  Or you send your dog back and they see that dog coming and they'll go before the dog gets  there.  And then if you got a good dog, the dog just kind of melts up and doesn't get back of it  
**[0:34:47-0:34:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:34:47):**  and bite it and everything's coming up.  So they stay calm and everything and go on up.  But it's all relationships with it.  
**[0:34:56-0:35:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:34:56):**  You know, the relationship with your cattle, the relationship with your horse and how the  horse relates to the cattle and then how that all relates back down to your grass and soil.  So it's all intertwined.  
**[0:35:08-0:35:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:35:08):**  It's all intertwined.  It's all intertwined.  Like I was saying over there at the mashto the other day and I never noticed that before  
**[0:35:17-0:35:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:35:17):**  about them changing the way they chew their cut.  You just put a little bit of pressure on them and it's funny to watch.  And it's already kind of nasty and like you said, nice and then grind in them.  
**[0:35:31-0:35:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:35:31):**  And that's things that we just normally, we're just going out there and we're doing it because  we're doing it, but we're not paying attention to what we're doing.  Right.  
**[0:35:41-0:35:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:35:41):**  It's hard to observe, remember and then compare.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[0:35:47-0:35:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:35:47):**  Cause you might go home.  I can observe a lot of stuff, but if I don't compare it to something I've already done,  it's like it don't make any sense.  
**[0:35:53-0:36:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:35:53):**  Yeah, but see, you can go home and start thinking you're doing this and you're not really doing  it.  So, well, that shit don't work.  
**[0:36:01-0:36:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:36:01):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  And that's what happened with Bud and his classes.  
**[0:36:05-0:36:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:36:05):**  These people sit there in the class and they don't do it.  And then they got a day to drive home and then they go ahead and they start practicing  on their cows and there's nobody there to correct them.  
**[0:36:21-0:36:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:36:21):**  So like if you two go to the school and you're working the same place, you two can kind of  correct each other unless you both got it backwards.  Yeah.  
**[0:36:30-0:36:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:36:30):**  Which that happens.  That happens too.  But when you're sitting there and you're just watching that video from a flat level, you  
**[0:36:38-0:36:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:36:38):**  can't.  Well, you see, we had a deal.  We got to have the bird's eye view.  
**[0:36:41-0:36:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:36:41):**  Yeah.  Well, that's the deal with the drone.  That's why I like doing all my videos with the drone.  
**[0:36:48-0:37:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:36:48):**  And that's what works out good out there is you're sitting up there on that hill and you  watch somebody doing something down there, you got a better idea of what's going on.  You see, when I went to the Bud Williams deal and I watched that, well, shoot, that might  
**[0:37:03-0:37:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:37:03):**  work because we had a pen, like the cows had to go in here and they come into the pen here  and then they had to go into the gate.  And there was a fence, a high, you can't see, it's a blind.  
**[0:37:16-0:37:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:37:16):**  And so they come in here where there's a barn here.  So they come in here and they go over here and then you try to bring them out.  Well, they come over here and then they come back here to the gate where they came in there.  
**[0:37:26-0:37:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:37:26):**  You can get them there.  There's always looping the windmill.  And so, you know, that getting out wide.  
**[0:37:31-0:37:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:37:31):**  So I, you know, I thought, well, we're supposed to go back, zigzag back and forth.  And so I'd dig in, they go that way and I'd dig out and then they kind of go my way.  When they didn't, I'd walk up with them, you know, and then I'd zig in and zig out and  
**[0:37:43-0:37:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:37:43):**  finally they went over there and then I zigged out.  I changed my angle and they, you know, I poked them in there.  Well, they said, well, when they go in the pen like this, you go, they'll all be pointed  
**[0:37:53-0:37:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:37:53):**  that way.  They're not turning around, coming back at you.  Well, I couldn't see.  
**[0:37:57-0:38:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:37:57):**  So they all went in the pen.  So then I had to go over and look.  I got it.  
**[0:38:02-0:38:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:38:02):**  They were in there.  Yeah.  And all it was like, well, that was way easier than hooting and hollering and beating on  
**[0:38:08-0:38:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:38:08):**  the barn.  And the funny thing is, is you get back there, especially you've got calves that are balling  up in the back and you start hooting and they're looking.  
**[0:38:16-0:38:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:38:16):**  Well, they all look and see what you're hollering at.  But if you notice, even though it's deadside of calves, the calves actually work better  than the cows.  
**[0:38:27-0:38:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:38:27):**  Right.  Because they haven't had all of the screwed up stuff to mess up their minds.  They're fresh.  
**[0:38:35-0:38:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:38:35):**  Yeah, they're fresh.  They haven't been, they haven't had a chance to get hammered on and all their instincts  gone.  
**[0:38:44-0:39:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:38:44):**  And basically, we're working with the cows' instincts to do this.  And some cows are harder than others because they've had those instincts smashed down more.  But I mean, it works a lot better than hooting and hollering and hollering and beating on  
**[0:39:04-0:39:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:39:04):**  the barn.  Our place has been significantly quiet.  And then we had a young man come in to help us one time and he was a holler.  
**[0:39:10-0:39:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:39:10):**  And he was back hollering and it was like, I haven't heard that in a long time.  They didn't come in very good.  I was like, well, nobody hollers in the first 10 minutes.  
**[0:39:23-0:39:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:39:23):**  They go back to their truck.  I was working with this guy and we're trying to get these heifers into a pen and we got  one pen into another pen and he starts hooting and hollering and he goes, Hey, hey, hey.  
**[0:39:35-0:39:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:39:35):**  And I go, great, omelet, alfalfa.  He's going, huh?  Well, you know, it's like, I've always been a smart ass.  
**[0:39:50-0:40:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:39:50):**  I just can't help it.  I noticed it too, you know, when people were getting them in, it's like, this is a way  up deal.  
**[0:40:00-0:40:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:40:00):**  Yeah.  Why are you hurrying those cattle?  You know?  
**[0:40:04-0:40:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:40:04):**  Yeah.  And I tell them, I say, you know, when we get them in, let's look at the ground.  Are you worth your pay?  
**[0:40:09-0:40:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:40:09):**  You know, if there's poop all over the ground, I said, I can't pay you.  There's your pay.  It's laying on the ground.  
**[0:40:17-0:40:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:40:17):**  Yeah.  What do they say?  I helped get them in.  
**[0:40:20-0:40:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:40:20):**  I said, you lost them a lot of weight.  Yeah.  But you can't, they don't know any better.  
**[0:40:28-0:40:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:40:28):**  It's like, you know, this place that I'm playing around on the dinner deal right now.  There was two of us on the game.  We'd have up to 3,500 head and there's times the manager would take off.  
**[0:40:43-0:40:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:40:43):**  He went to Japan to visit his daughter in Japan for six weeks and he left me there with  2,800 head of steers.  Plus I had another like four or five hundred head on a desert lease about 10 miles away.  
**[0:40:58-0:41:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:40:58):**  And then I had a, we had our farm guy that took care of the pivots.  And it was no real problem.  Well, then after he left, I had a bunch of cattle.  
**[0:41:08-0:41:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:41:08):**  They wanted me to weigh in and I had to bring them, you know, it's like from the furthest  pivot away from the scale.  So you got to go buy three pivots and then go through about half to three quarters mile  
**[0:41:22-0:41:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:41:22):**  in desert.  And then you got to take them through three and a quarter of it.  So you're going, you know, you're going through four miles with them.  
**[0:41:29-0:41:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:41:29):**  And I got them strung out and I got them started out there and, you know, went back, kind of  checked the back and I wanted, I come up to the front cause they were just going across  the, they're going across the county road and they're a little patch of grass there  
**[0:41:40-0:41:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:41:40):**  before I go up to the pens.  And I only had like the wing that made the alley going up there was only a three string  wire fence, you know.  
**[0:41:49-0:42:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:41:49):**  And so I got these steers coming out and I stand up my strip and I look down there and  I see one of the local ranchers and I waved to him right around the goat.  And then when I, when he just sat there for me to get them all across and I waved to him  
**[0:42:03-0:42:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:42:03):**  and I just went up and picked up that front end and started stringing them over for the  scales and what's Walmart the next weekend if the car is bad and cause we're centrally  located between Walmart's it's a hundred, 120 miles to super Walmart in any direction  
**[0:42:17-0:42:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:42:17):**  we go.  It's not a bad place to be.  Yeah.  
**[0:42:21-0:42:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:42:21):**  But anyways, I'm up there and I see this guy and he, I see him and he just puts his hands  on his hips and he just starts laughing.  And I go, Richard, what's so funny?  
**[0:42:32-0:42:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:42:32):**  And he says, you know, he says, when I pulled up there the other day, there's 70, 80 head  over there and these cattle are strung out and I'm looking at what the hell is going  on here.  
**[0:42:40-0:42:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:42:40):**  And I just getting ready to go back down there to go to the, let somebody know cows brought.  So then I see you trotting up there with that little black dog and you just kind of leaned  over there and you left.  
**[0:42:53-0:43:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:42:53):**  And then you a little bit later here, you come up and he says, you go across the road  and you just waved at me and just went like you're going in the fence.  And he says, I counted over 700 stairs.  
**[0:43:03-0:43:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:43:03):**  And he says, and you're taking them like you're going to the fence, like that's just what  you're doing.  I said, well, it is.  
**[0:43:09-0:43:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:43:09):**  That's what I was there for.  Yeah, I said, that's what I do.  And he goes, well, how come I've got 250 cows, I've got 10 cowboys and I can't get them gathered.  
**[0:43:18-0:43:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:43:18):**  And I said, well, maybe you need to get some better cowboys.  And when that place got sold on a waste option to buy, to deal with these farmers, I started  doing, my wife wanted to stay there.  
**[0:43:31-0:43:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:43:31):**  So I mean, I turned down work because I had actually, when, when primo Walker shut that  down, you know, some of his other guys, you know, that he worked with in other places,  I mean, I had a job off in Colorado for more than what I was making down there, but I turned  
**[0:43:45-0:43:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:43:45):**  it down because that's what my wife wanted to stay.  And so then I got to figure, okay, what am I going to do?  So I decided that, you know, the guy that had been, that I'd worked with, I'd worked  
**[0:43:56-0:44:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:43:56):**  with him at Leishman's, he fired me there, then he hired me down there.  And he was after me to kind of start teaching.  I said, well, I'll go ahead and I'll start teaching this and, and you know, just day  
**[0:44:06-0:44:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:44:06):**  work and train a couple of horses and that.  And that guy that can't get his 250 cows gathered with 10 cowboys that watched me bring 800  head over to go to the fence would not hire me for day work.  
**[0:44:20-0:44:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:44:20):**  Really?  Yeah.  Well, you might embarrass his cowboys.  
**[0:44:25-0:44:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:44:25):**  Well, that's exactly what kind of a deal it is.  Once you start going in there and doing stuff that they're taking a big crew to do, then  you're just ticking off their crew.  
**[0:44:34-0:44:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:44:34):**  Then they can't get the guys and then all they got is you and, you know, it makes no  difference.  You want to hire them a couple of times a month even to just go over there and go through  
**[0:44:44-0:44:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:44:44):**  your cows.  I can still go and bring them in, but they don't look at it that way.  So it was, and then just getting started.  
**[0:44:52-0:45:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:44:52):**  I mean, you know, I have to admit that it's, I'm not just in left field, I'm left field  with two ballparks over and people just, I have people ask me about it.  Tradition's awful hard to get rid of.  
**[0:45:05-0:45:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:45:05):**  Yeah.  Well, I actually had people ask me about it, if I'm with a cow, you know, what did you  do?  
**[0:45:10-0:45:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:45:10):**  Did you make your money being a warrior or something?  Then you decide you're going to teach people how to cowboy, you know, and it's like, you  know, a slow start.  
**[0:45:20-0:45:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:45:20):**  Then I get people that actually like me for something.  Where do you fight any of those?  Well, I don't want to mention any states because it might reverse the whole damn state.  
**[0:45:41-0:45:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:45:41):**  And some stuff you think back in the day when we didn't have fence and there were cattle  everywhere, they were doing, they couldn't have been poking them.  One of the things that Bud Williams would always ask in his classes, okay, now these  
**[0:45:58-0:46:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:45:58):**  guys when they're doing these cattle drives, they'd be taking 2000 head of steers that  started out wilder than hell and they're taking them all the way to Montana, you know, or  Kansas City or wherever they're going with eight or 10 guys.  
**[0:46:10-0:46:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:46:10):**  And gaining two pounds a day.  And gaining while they're doing it.  And yet we've got 100 cows and a 200 acre pasture and it takes 10 guys to get them in.  
**[0:46:22-0:46:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:46:22):**  What happened?  You know, really, I mean, seriously, what?  We lost our stockmanship and our cows forgot how to be cows.  
**[0:46:31-0:46:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:46:31):**  Yeah, fence.  Mechanization and rodeo did help.  Quit saying that.

**[0:46:43-0:46:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:46:43):**  I always want to get all the cowboys pissed off.  Hey, if you don't, you're not doing something right.  Well, I haven't pissed off somebody in a podcast episode.  
**[0:46:53-0:47:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:46:53):**  Probably not doing it right.  You know, I both know Ethan and I like Ethan and everything, but I was talking to him here  last month before those steers come in and they were gathering wheat pasture cattle.  
**[0:47:09-0:47:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:47:09):**  He said, we got 15 tied down right now.  Good Lord.  Wheat pasture cattle.  
**[0:47:15-0:47:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:47:15):**  And they couldn't get them in because these punchers that he.  Yeah.  Well, we did the same thing out there at Greensburg last summer.  
**[0:47:28-0:47:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:47:28):**  Three days.  First two days, not one missed bobble, nothing.  The third day, it was like it was preplanned.  
**[0:47:37-0:47:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:47:37):**  We drove those cattle three or four miles.  And when we got them to the pens, they broke and we wrote three trailer loads.  Oh, my gosh.  
**[0:47:48-0:47:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:47:48):**  Well, how did you do that after three miles?  That's just it.  You know what I would have done?  
**[0:47:56-0:48:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:47:56):**  It was all preplanned because we had to entertain the troops.  You know what I think?  You know what I've heard?  
**[0:48:03-0:48:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:48:03):**  That's the type of deal that I'd go in there and I'd look at that and I'd just go load  my horse and my predator and go home.  But you know, he had to keep them on twisters happy so they'll come with him.  
**[0:48:16-0:48:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:48:16):**  So you got to give them and that's what they love to do.  That bunch I had that he was involved with two years ago.  He kind of bought into it mid season and I didn't know about it.  
**[0:48:28-0:48:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:48:28):**  Here's one of those deals like when he's shipping cattle, this is the day that they're going  home.  What time do you want us to be there?  
**[0:48:35-0:48:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:48:35):**  I don't.  I don't.  We'll be there.  
**[0:48:38-0:48:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:48:38):**  We'll be there anyway.  We'll help.  Nine.  
**[0:48:41-0:48:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:48:41):**  What time do you want the trucks there?  Nine.  What time are you going to be ready?  
**[0:48:47-0:49:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:48:47):**  Nine.  I went out at seven, had them standing in the corrals when they showed up at eight.  And there was like nine of them in four pickups.  
**[0:49:00-0:49:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:49:00):**  And they were happy because there were six that were a mile and a half away.  And they went up there and man, they cowboyed up the wing.  They got them loaded up in the pasture.  
**[0:49:10-0:49:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:49:10):**  It was kind of impressive to watch.  Well, these guys can, I mean, they're good at what they do.  I wasn't going to give them much of an opportunity to do it.  
**[0:49:21-0:49:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:49:21):**  Well, what's really fun to do, you know, they got all these guys and they got these videos  all loading them, loading them all up faster.  They never show them doing that when, you know, they're not really all the way bred  
**[0:49:33-0:49:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:49:33):**  up and they got some more hot cows and you got one that's coming in, this pasture and  that, you know.  So, what I'll do, because when I have full bowls down there, it'll be out of a, you know,  
**[0:49:44-0:49:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:49:44):**  it might be a 10 or 15 second pasture.  And I'll pull the trailer out there and I'll take eight 10 foot panels and I'll go in a  circle right off of that.  
**[0:49:54-0:50:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:49:54):**  And then I'll take one panel and I'll move it in, no wing, I move it in.  Okay.  So, you're coming around that, you know, that little, that little deal where you step out  
**[0:50:05-0:50:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:50:05):**  to the outside.  When you're coming up to there, you step out the outside, they go in.  You can take any hot cows or anything that you don't want to load in the trailer, you  
**[0:50:14-0:50:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:50:14):**  sit there and sort them off and then put them in the trailer, usually without ever closing  the gate.  And then you can lock that one, that bowl or two bowls up there in the front of the  
**[0:50:23-0:50:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:50:23):**  trailer and you can go make another circle someplace else and come in and do the same  thing.  You just kind of, you just kind of pick up your horse and fade off a little bit to the  
**[0:50:32-0:50:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:50:32):**  outside and they drop into that circle every time.  I'm lazy.  I just run the bowl, run everything into the corrals, sort the bowls off and put the cows  
**[0:50:42-0:50:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:50:42):**  back on rotation.  You are not doing that in a 15 section pasture.  No, no.  
**[0:50:49-0:51:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:50:49):**  Doing that in about a 30 paddock rotation cell.  Yeah.  Well, you know, they always talked about up at Cassidy.  
**[0:51:00-0:51:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:51:00):**  Back in the day when they were shipping out of the turnpike, you know, they go out to  gather their cows and they wake up and then, you know, they go do it in the dark and then  the sun would come up and there'd be a set of cows on, you know, yearlings over here  
**[0:51:14-0:51:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:51:14):**  on the hill and there'd be yearlings over here on the hill with a different group and  you just had to wait your turn to put them in the pens.  And then you just sit up there and then guys would sit up there.  
**[0:51:26-0:51:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:51:26):**  So they had them all gathered up.  And so then, you know, whoever was there first, they go first and down they go and they get  them all loaded up and then the next group would bring their group and get them in there.  
**[0:51:37-0:51:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:51:37):**  Yeah.  They didn't do it the way they're doing it today.  They couldn't have sat on a herd and then put them and then have two or three different  
**[0:51:46-0:51:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:51:46):**  herds sitting there waiting.  Well, this guy that's kind of helping my son when he gets a problem with the well, which  they think they got it fixed, but they're not certain.  
**[0:51:56-0:52:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:51:56):**  But anyways, went with him.  We had another friend and he'd come back into this deal in New Mexico and he'd have me go  up there once in a while while they were going to shift some cattle around on from his ranch  
**[0:52:09-0:52:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:52:09):**  on another ranch.  And we go up there and we rode their own up in the corner and Gary gets on one side of  me and bike gets on the other.  
**[0:52:17-0:52:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:52:17):**  And they go, no, shut up.  Don't say a damn thing.  They're pulling these cattle out to go to their place.  
**[0:52:24-0:52:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:52:24):**  You just got to let them do it or it's going to be...  And these guys start hitting me with their reins on either side of me because this son  of a bitch is looping through a road deer.  
**[0:52:37-0:52:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:52:37):**  That's fair.  If you're going to have fun, you got to do something.  This is the second reason why I don't pack a gun down there because if I run into a bunch  
**[0:52:48-0:52:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:52:48):**  of illegals, they've got guns.  I'm not going to, you know, I want to go hide.  I don't want to get, you know, so.  
**[0:52:57-0:53:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:52:57):**  And the second reason is a guy like that, I would be so tempted to just pull it out  and boom.  And that probably just got me on terroristic threat charge and I'm being in jail in another  
**[0:53:08-0:53:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:53:08):**  week.  Well, at least I'll say I got to learn from you.  We know people with lots of land and heavy equipment.  
**[0:53:15-0:53:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:53:15):**  Yeah, but it's people's attitude on all this cattle and then the number of people that  aren't figuring out the raising it.  Again, it's like, this is what everybody does, so I'm going to do it too.  
**[0:53:32-0:53:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:53:32):**  Well, they're not thinking why they're doing it.  There's that.  Or this is the way dad did it, that's the way I'm going to do it.  
**[0:53:39-0:53:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:53:39):**  See, I went to college and of course, you know, we were a little creative and then we  had a lot of tradition, I'm fifth generation.  So, you know, I go to school and I learn a whole bunch of new stuff and come back.  
**[0:53:52-0:54:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:53:52):**  It's like, well, we need to do this.  And I was like, no, this is not what we're going to do.  It's like, well, why don't I go to school for?  
**[0:54:00-0:54:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:54:00):**  But then after a little bit of time.  For 10 years, I listened to you tell me to go to college so I could learn something.  I learned something.  
**[0:54:07-0:54:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:54:07):**  I come home and you tell me.  No.  I'm going to be out of the house for four years.  
**[0:54:11-0:54:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:54:11):**  But sometimes when you come back, you find out some of that tradition had a base to us.  And college didn't have it all in there either.  I'm going to say tradition 50 years ago had a base to it.  
**[0:54:26-0:54:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:54:26):**  Tradition now can be 10 years.  And then a lot of those old timers used to go out and they'd move the cattle around.  Then they got around to it.  
**[0:54:37-0:54:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:54:37):**  300 career is a perfect example of this.  We're driving down to his ranch down there and he's telling me about his great grandfather's  journal.  
**[0:54:47-0:54:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:54:47):**  He's the one that started the ranch.  And you're talking about Northern Mexico, Chihuahua Desert, and you think just bare  ground.  
**[0:54:56-0:55:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:54:56):**  Well, if you go and you read the trapper journals of like Kit Carson and John Z. Fremont and  Bass, they're going across there.  Their problem was not their livestock starving.  
**[0:55:07-0:55:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:55:07):**  It was dying of thirst because they didn't know where the water was.  So they started traveling during monsoon season because they had seasonal streams and springs  and everything else.  
**[0:55:17-0:55:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:55:17):**  So anyway, his great grandfather's description was of what they're doing.  They're moving the cattle all the time.  When it got dry, they scattered them up.  
**[0:55:26-0:55:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:55:26):**  And when that water was plentiful, they'd bring them back in.  And the description of the grass, it was like knee height of their horses to you horseback.  And he's got a lot of that grass down there like that now.  
**[0:55:40-0:55:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:55:40):**  The Tabosa grass, we look at that as a bunch of grass.  If you take and you look at the, you know, and these grass books and forage manuals from  the 40s and before, they'll say Tabosa makes good hay.  
**[0:55:57-0:56:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:55:57):**  Now they say it makes fair feed.  And you look at it now and it's like, you couldn't even hay that with horses.  You know, it's so, I mean, the clumps are huge.  
**[0:56:12-0:56:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:56:12):**  They're far apart.  And so anyways, then his, you know, and when they went to town, we're going 20 miles over  to the neighbors and they pick up and just get a long trot and go over to the neighbors.  
**[0:56:25-0:56:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:56:25):**  They had to put protective gear on the front legs of the horses and chest because if they  didn't, they cut them up, the grass would just slice them up.  So then his grandfather takes over the place.  
**[0:56:40-0:56:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:56:40):**  Well, you know, they've got this, you know, this, we always fall for this technological  crap.  Okay, we're going to put up a windmill.  
**[0:56:48-0:57:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:56:48):**  Well, windmill's a pretty good deal if you utilize it right, but we're going to put up  the windmill and use this barbed wire stuff where we can put them in there and then cows  can't get away and, you know, we can go to the bar or start another business or whatever.  
**[0:57:00-0:57:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:57:00):**  We're going to have to play with these cows.  And then his dad did the same thing.  And when I went down there, oh, sheesh, I think it was 2011, I'm not sure.  
**[0:57:11-0:57:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:57:11):**  We're riding out across one of these pastures and this grass is up over my knees, horseback,  and it looked like Tabosa grass, but it was really super fine stamped.  And the ground underneath it was just like this tabletop.  
**[0:57:29-0:57:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:57:29):**  And I said, you know, what type of grass is this?  I said, it kind of looks like Tabosa.  This is what happens to Tabosa when you take care of it.  
**[0:57:39-0:57:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:57:39):**  And here, I don't know that we've had such a drop down there.  I don't know what he's done the last couple of years, but he had that when he took it  over from his dad, they were running 125 cows on 30 cows makers.  
**[0:57:50-0:58:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:57:50):**  They were feeding four to six months out of the year.  And they were also having to wind their calves at three to four months old.  And then here just before this drought started, he actually had it down to 22 acres a cow.  
**[0:58:07-0:58:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:58:07):**  And he wasn't weaning until 10 months old and wasn't feeding anything.  He just puts out ribbon and sea salt and that's it.  You know, he's making money.  
**[0:58:17-0:58:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:58:17):**  He's finally got that ranch for, he's making money on it.  And he figures if, you know, if they could get enough good years strung together there,  he could get the grass built up to drop that down to around 12 acres a cow.

How far west of you, how far west of Van Horn is that place?  That place from Van Horn Airport to the earthquake in front of his house is 100 air miles.  
**[0:58:44-0:58:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:58:44):**  Which way?  Kind of west and just a little tiny bit south.  So it's probably what, like a 16, 14 or 16 inch rainfall area?  
**[0:58:55-0:59:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:58:55):**  No, it's like we are, it's supposedly 10.  We haven't seen 10 in a long time.  This is what rain sounds like right here.  
**[0:59:09-0:59:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:59:09):**  I thought my horses were going to drown the other day, just wet stuff.  And they're looking up like, what is this?  And you know what, they're not drinking, there's much water here.  
**[0:59:22-0:59:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:59:22):**  No they're not.  You know, I put out a 50 gallon tub and it's, I got to fill it every day if I don't have  a float valve on it.  
**[0:59:31-0:59:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:59:31):**  And I got a little 25, that little 25 gallon tub down there and they barely had it half  drank down.  So it's like.  
**[0:59:40-0:59:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:59:40):**  What's your theory?  Moisture in the forage?  Yeah, moisture in the air, moisture in the air, it's moisture.  
**[0:59:45-0:59:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:59:45):**  Down there it's just dry.  They're parched.  Yeah.  
**[0:59:50-1:00:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=0:59:50):**  Yeah, I was day working one place down there and I rode my horses two days and then I rode  one of her horses.  And I come in and it's about quarter till seven, quarter till eight when I get set up  
**[1:00:05-1:00:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=1:00:05):**  in my truck.  And she said, boy didn't you water that horse?  Didn't you ever let that horse get the water?  
**[1:00:11-1:00:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=1:00:11):**  And I said, yeah I watered it every time I come across water.  And I ran out of water, I'm all about ready to pass out from dehydration.  And put the horse up to the saddle in the back of my truck and I got in my truck and  
**[1:00:25-1:00:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=1:00:25):**  turned it on and the thermometer on there said 117 at 745 PM.  So how hot was it during the day?  Yeah.  
**[1:00:38-1:00:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=1:00:38):**  I mean, cause you're not, I mean you don't have no shade down there.  That does not sound pleasant Bob.  It doesn't sound like a nice place to live.  
**[1:00:47-1:00:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=1:00:47):**  No it doesn't.  It's a challenge.  You want to live life without a challenge.  
**[1:00:52-1:00:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=1:00:52):**  You know, I think that's part of the problem people have today is they just want it all  handed to them.  They don't want a challenge.  
**[1:00:59-1:01:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=1:00:59):**  They don't want to think about it.  They just want it.  I got to say the journey's the key.  
**[1:01:03-1:01:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=1:01:03):**  I mean, getting the prize doesn't count.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  
**[1:01:08-1:01:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=1:01:08):**  You know, it's not, you know, it's like, what's that one saying?  The goal of life isn't to come in and die at the end with a pristine body is to come  sliding in all bent and mutilated and go, man, that was a hell of a ride.  
**[1:01:24-1:01:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=1:01:24):**  Let's do it again.  You know,  And the only thing that's sound financial planning, the only check you ever bounced  
**[1:01:31-1:01:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=1:01:31):**  is the last one you wrote before you died.  Yeah.  In economics, they always say you got to die 50,000 a day.  
**[1:01:42-1:01:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=1:01:42):**  Like you've done it right.  You can't die yet, Bob.  And this is why I constantly check my balance and go, and I've learned that I've got to  
**[1:01:50-1:02:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=1:01:50):**  go down through because I kind of, I can remember where I've been, what I've spent and that,  and I can go on down through and see what's actually, you know, in there.  The only thing is, is every once in a while, the wife will go buy something on Amazon and  
**[1:02:03-1:02:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=1:02:03):**  you know, it just kind of automatically goes onto the one card and then it's, then it's  like, oh crap, I don't have any money.  Where'd it go?  
**[1:02:12-1:02:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=1:02:12):**  Magic.  Yeah, magic.  Where are you headed to after this?  
**[1:02:15-1:02:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=1:02:15):**  Are you headed back home?  I'm going to go down to Gage, Oklahoma and spend a couple of days with, with just visiting  with, with Pedro because he's got that deal.  
**[1:02:29-1:02:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=1:02:29):**  Okay.  Wow.  He, you get it, you get it.  
**[1:02:34-1:02:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=1:02:34):**  I may follow you down there.  I may follow you down there, huh?  Because I want to work with, I want to work with him.  
**[1:02:39-1:02:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=1:02:39):**  I'm kind of mentoring him.  About the same distance.  He's, he's, he's really, you know, helped me out with getting, getting schools going  
**[1:02:46-1:03:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=1:02:46):**  down in Mexico and he's got, he can put herds together, but every time I worked with him  down there, it was like horses that don't even know how to open a gate, let alone bend  into a cow and go, I mean, so you're, it's like, it's just a, I get it done, but I mean,  
**[1:03:01-1:03:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=1:03:01):**  I'm really having to work at it to get the, the, so I want to go down there and ride with  him a couple of days because he's, he's, what's the guy's name with Ranching for Profit, Jesse.  What's his last name?  
**[1:03:13-1:03:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=1:03:13):**  Jesse.  Yeah.  Jesse something is what he said, his guy's name.  
**[1:03:18-1:03:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=1:03:18):**  But anyway, he's supposed to be big with Ranching for Profit and, and Pedro is going to take  him.  Who's the name of that?  
**[1:03:25-1:03:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=1:03:25):**  That took Pratt's Place.  Uh, Dallas Mount.  He didn't take Pratt's Place.  
**[1:03:30-1:03:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=1:03:30):**  He just bought the company from Pratt and Dave is actually still teaching.  Right.  Yeah.  
**[1:03:35-1:03:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=1:03:35):**  I think he's actually in Columbus.  I thought he was.  I think today was the last time.  
**[1:03:38-1:03:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=1:03:38):**  Anyway, he's wanting to put these cattle together.  I'm going to, I want to go down and ride with him and, and cause he's really trying to get  into his horsemanship and I want to show him the difference between, you know, but he's,  
**[1:03:51-1:04:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=1:03:51):**  he's done, I went down and spent a couple of days with him working bison down there  on the, on the Uno Ranch in Mexico.  And he wound up getting those, I mean, they had big crews and everything else and killing  
**[1:04:02-1:04:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=1:04:02):**  bison to get them into the pens.  And he set up a couple of traps and, you know, I worked for him a couple of days and then  he used that and he kept going.  
**[1:04:08-1:04:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=1:04:08):**  And by golly, he moved them into one trap and then he moved them into the next and it  was all like two wire hot wire.  And then he got them in the pen and he had them bison where he could go in there and  
**[1:04:20-1:04:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=1:04:20):**  sort of horseback.  Holy smokes.  Yeah.  
**[1:04:23-1:04:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=1:04:23):**  That's a lot different than the people I've talked to dealing with bison.  Well, you know why?  Pretty wound up about things.  
**[1:04:30-1:04:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=1:04:30):**  Yeah, well they do both.  They treat them like a, like we treat our cows.  They're going to get wound up.  
**[1:04:37-1:04:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=1:04:37):**  And when I went down there, it was like, they're too big to wind.  Well the thing is, is they, they, you'll start working and they'll start to move and you  don't hear their, from out in the middle of the herd and you'll have some old cow coming  
**[1:04:50-1:05:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=1:04:50):**  out.  And that's what you had to kind of work with was that grunting and trying to do that and  keep her contained on the inside and get the motion going.  
**[1:05:00-1:05:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=1:05:00):**  But he was down there for a couple of years and he was able to work through that.  But his girlfriend was working for the same NGO and she was like the grant writer.  Well, she's working cows with him now and she doesn't want to do that anymore.  
**[1:05:18-1:05:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=1:05:18):**  But that American Prairie Reserve, he's got the education, he's got a master's degree  in Rangeland College.  She's got, she's actually, her degree is in marine biology and then she's, she's learned  
**[1:05:32-1:05:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=1:05:32):**  how to do this grant stuff.  So between them, you know, I call up American Prairie Reserve and they go, oh, that's that  idiot cowboy again, you know, and then, but they go in there and they've got the education.  
**[1:05:45-1:05:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=1:05:45):**  Right.  And they know how to write these grants and proposals up and down.  So what I've got to talk to them about is she wasn't there when she was visiting her  
**[1:05:53-1:06:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=1:05:53):**  family in New York when it come up.  But what I want them to do is I want them to put up a grant, put together a proposal  for the American Prairie Land Reserve to actually herd the bison through.  
**[1:06:07-1:06:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=1:06:07):**  But go to Turner, go to, what's this one outside of Denver, the big bison ranch.  Then you've got that Rocky Mountain bison ranch and the Nature Conservancy has.  Well, then there's triple seven up there just south of Rapid City.  
**[1:06:22-1:06:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=1:06:22):**  Yeah.  And then put together as many heifers as you can, two, three, 4,000 yet.  Go to the place, work with those heifers after they've been weaned, take them up, settle  
**[1:06:32-1:06:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=1:06:32):**  them, put them out, do, go around every one of these places and do that where you've got  three or 4,000 bison heifers that you've already conditioned to be worth.  You know, you got to get some fulls in there and then start working yourself a migratory  
**[1:06:50-1:07:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=1:06:50):**  pattern around that million, you know, so they're trying to put together a million acre  reserve, get them, start them on a migratory pattern, take them, show them where the water  is and do that for four years and then sit back and monitor them for a couple of years  
**[1:07:06-1:07:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=1:07:06):**  to see if they, you know, and if they maintain, they have to go out there and have somebody  out there doing that once in a while.  But that would be cooler than all, get out.  
**[1:07:16-1:07:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=1:07:16):**  If you could get those bison doing that and actually, actually migrating.  Doing what they did.  What they're supposed to do.  
**[1:07:25-1:07:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=1:07:25):**  Because we've driven, we've, you know, we almost got them down to the extinction.  Yeah, but the federal government will get involved with it and mess that all up.  Yeah, well, we got them down to almost the extinction.  
**[1:07:36-1:07:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=1:07:36):**  Four small gene pools.  Yeah.  So, then what did we do?  
**[1:07:40-1:07:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=1:07:40):**  We start handling them kind of like cows.  And you're putting the pressure on them and it's like, okay, it's like these, you know,  you get a bunch of bromas in Australia, you can go down and I mean, they're easy to work  
**[1:07:56-1:08:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=1:07:56):**  with unless you get it on the wrong place and then they want to eat your lunch.  But if you take these and you get them gently down before you can go ahead and hit this  pattern and then, okay, then we got something going.  
**[1:08:11-1:08:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=1:08:11):**  And you know, you could be harvesting them and selling them for meat and everything to  where it would be, it would actually be a profitable deal letting them do that.  That seemed like a great place to end.  
**[1:08:24-1:08:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-7-Bob-Kinford-at-the-Flying-W--after-dinner-e1338mj#t=1:08:24):**  I really want to thank Bob, the Holy Family, and everybody else for agreeing to let me  record that.  I really enjoyed the conversation and I hope you did too.

### Ranching Reboot  (2021-02-15)  
### Author(s): Red Hills Rancher

**[0:00:31-0:00:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:00:31):**  Hi, this is Ranching Reboot with Red Hills Rancher and yours truly CK.  Today we have Clay Connery of Working Cows Podcast.  How are you doing Clay?  
**[0:00:42-0:00:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:00:42):**  Good glad to be here.  Thanks for the opportunity.  So Clay, we just wrapped up Working Cows 175 which came out a week ago.  
**[0:00:52-0:01:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:00:52):**  And this is kind of part two to that.  So the theme of our podcast is talking is we're trying to talk to new producers.  So tell us all your story Clay.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:01:03):**  Sure.  I grew up on a ranch in western South Dakota.  My family's ranch is about four miles from the Wyoming border.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:01:11):**  About equal distance from the Nebraska and the North Dakota border.  So it's extreme western and then in the center of the state north south.  And grew up on a ranch that my parents started from nothing in the 80s and they worked town  
**[0:01:29-0:01:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:01:29):**  jobs.  My mom was a teacher, elementary school teacher and my dad worked for now it's called Century  Link when he started working for him.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:01:38):**  I think they were Northwestern Bell, although he might have been there even before the Bell's  telephone systems were broken up by the monopoly antitrust or whatever it was in the 80s.  So he was there for that and got his ranch started.  
**[0:01:55-0:02:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:01:55):**  And by the time I left home, there was about enough land for us to calve our cows on and  then they were on leased land for the rest of the year.  So about 60 days they were there calving out and then they'd go out to lease land in various  
**[0:02:10-0:02:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:02:10):**  locations for the rest of the year.  And so I went away at 18 to Bible school.  Went two years there in Milwaukee, kind of getting a taste of the city life.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:02:20):**  I didn't have much use for the ranch.  When I left home, started to recognize some of the benefits of the rural lifestyle after  living in the city for a couple of years and not the least of which is fresh air and abundant  
**[0:02:36-0:02:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:02:36):**  sunshine and those kinds of things.  So came home and got selectively involved in ranching for about 10 years.  And while I worked on staff at a church and got married and had four kids and all of those  
**[0:02:50-0:02:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:02:50):**  things.  And so was selectively involved on the ranch during branding and calving out heifers and  those kinds of things.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:02:58):**  And then as the town job that I had kind of started to dry up, became more involved as  an employee of the ranch.  And that launched me into right at the start of that involvement on the ranch.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:03:12):**  I started, went to the High Plains Ranch Practicum, which was taught by Dallas Mount.  And I got to run this past him.  I said it was an extension sanctioned version of ranching for profit.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:03:25):**  And he said, yeah, that's an okay description of it.  So I'll continue to use that, I guess.  And so that really blew up all my ranching paradigms.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:03:34):**  And we went and I continued to be involved at the ranch for a couple of years.  And then I couldn't support my family anymore at the town job that I had.  And so I found another job as a pastor of a little country church.  
**[0:03:48-0:04:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:03:48):**  And we purchased some land here where I'm at in less extreme Western South Dakota, kind  of West Central South Dakota.  And so we purchased some land and I got to implement some of the things that I've been  
**[0:04:03-0:04:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:04:03):**  learning through the Working House podcast over the last three and a half years of doing  that.  And so, yeah, just got to implement some of those things in our first season of management  
**[0:04:15-0:04:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:04:15):**  starting in March of 2020.  And now we're coming into our second season of management here in the beginning of 2021.  So that's kind of my ranching story in just a couple of minutes anyways.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:04:33):**  That's great.  So tell me about some of, you just mentioned some practices, some innovative new practices.  So let's talk about those.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:04:39):**  Sure.  So in the spring of 2020, it started out with strategically unrolling hay for my dad's cows  because they were there to calve.  
**[0:04:49-0:05:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:04:49):**  And I talked to other people about bale grazing while calving and they said, maybe not such  a good idea to put that much manure and urine in one place while you're trying to calve.  So we strategically unrolled hay across the most abused portion of the land that we got  
**[0:05:04-0:05:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:05:04):**  and by abuse, all I'm saying is years and years of haying, hay making on that land with  no intentional replacement of nutrients.  And so there's evidence of that abuse is lots of plant spacing, not a lot of ground cover,  
**[0:05:22-0:05:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:05:22):**  bare ground, kind of a bit of a stunted growth curve, I would say in that-  General lack of fertility.  Right.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:05:30):**  Pretty much general.  So we're trying to replace that fertility strategically by unrolling hay strategically  across that.  
**[0:05:38-0:06:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:05:38):**  And then after that, after those cows left, custom grazing cattle came in and that was,  I just actually was forced to do the math at Ranching for Profit last week.  And so I can tell you pretty accurately that it was a 1.66 increase over the NRCS stated  
**[0:06:00-0:06:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:06:00):**  carrying capacity.  So year one, we brought those cows in and brought, actually it was 54 yearlings and  six lame cows, and then my own cows and calves to take us to about 70 animal units out there.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:06:16):**  But the standard animal unit is not that many.  I think it's, I don't know.  I don't know.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:06:22):**  I don't remember if it was 66 was the standard animal units with the 54 yearlings.  I could do that math again, but-  I have really small cows too.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:06:30):**  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah, I do.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:06:33):**  I sold some open cows.  Calves were just taken straight off of them.  And as open cows, they sold at 1100 pounds.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:06:40):**  So pretty small critters for this neighborhood, but yeah.  And then anyways, so yeah, we brought them in, moved them every day or every other day  with a hot wire and mobile watering tank.  
**[0:06:53-0:07:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:06:53):**  And they left a lot behind, even with the 1.66 carrying capacity increase.  They left a lot behind and I'm looking forward to next year seeing some of the regrowth and  what that happens.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:07:09):**  And then after they left, we went to swath grazing.  My neighbors have to cross my land to get to the back half of their hayfield.  And so they said, Hey, there's like 13 acres of alfalfa and grass mix there.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:07:25):**  Pretty good 50-50 split between crested wheat and alfalfa.  And they said, Hey, we'll put that up for you as hay bales if you want.  And I said, how about I've got enough hay bales to get me through the winter this year.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:07:36):**  How about you just swath that down for me and I'll graze it in the swaths?  And they're like, okay, if that's what you want, that's what we'll do.  And so we were like, why wouldn't you want us to put it in a bale and put it in the shed  
**[0:07:49-0:07:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:07:49):**  for you?  Yeah.  So we did the swath grazing after the custom grazing cattle left.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:07:56):**  And I took those hay bales I was talking about, the aforementioned hay bales I was talking  about, and I lined them all up.  And right now, I've got cows and sheep bale grazing together in.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:08:07):**  Yeah, so I just kicked the ewe lambs back in with the sheep.  And the weather's are going to the market on Thursday.  And so I've got last year's ewe lambs, and I've got cows, calves, bread heifers, all  
**[0:08:25-0:08:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:08:25):**  bale grazing together with the sheep right now.  That's what's going on at my place right now.  You seeing any biology stacking by multi-species grazing yet?  
**[0:08:38-0:08:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:08:38):**  I don't know.  I live in an arid environment, 16 inches of rain a year.  I live in a very, the soil I have is very heavy clay soil dominated.  
**[0:08:51-0:09:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:08:51):**  Once you get up on one of the ridges on the west side of my place, you'll find some silt  loam type soils.  But most of my land is heavy clay soils.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:09:06):**  And so I think it's going to be a slow response.  So I'm trying to figure out how to speed that up.  And I was just having a conversation earlier today that part of the way to speed that up  
**[0:09:17-0:09:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:09:17):**  might be moving four or five times a day at high stock density.  So I have to figure out a way to make that work from a labor perspective.  But yeah, so I'm not sure what kind of good or harm we did to the soil last year.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:09:37):**  We tried to do everything we could to only do good things for it.  There were a few mistakes here and there.  But I don't know if I can tell you yet what kind of benefits we brought to the soil with  
**[0:09:50-0:10:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:09:50):**  those practices.  I'm excited for this spring to see what that looks like.  What are some of the things you're going to be looking for next spring to see which way  
**[0:10:03-0:10:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:10:03):**  you're moving the needle, whether you're moving that in the positive or negative direction  with your management?  I think the way the growing season starts, the way the water infiltrates the soil or  
**[0:10:19-0:10:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:10:19):**  doesn't infiltrate the soil.  Some of those things, how fast does that growth curve get started?  How long is it sustained?  
**[0:10:29-0:10:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:10:29):**  Are there new species of plants?  The east end of that place that never got missed with the cutting tool, probably since  they brought home the first double nine mower and small square baler all the way up until  
**[0:10:42-0:11:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:10:42):**  the 14 foot moco and the rake and the big round baler, that place has been hayed every  single year, probably for the last 50 years.  So it's pretty much dominated by a single species of crested wheat.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:11:00):**  It's a monoculture of crested wheat.  So I'm looking forward to seeing are we making gains?  Are there new species coming in?  
**[0:11:08-0:11:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:11:08):**  In western South Dakota, because it gets rain at a similar time of year every year and that  rain kind of shuts off in July, we don't have a lot of warm season grasses here.  So if we start to see some of those, I'll know that the water holding capacity is increasing  
**[0:11:25-0:11:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:11:25):**  and that water is doing some good beyond the cool season grass growth phase and we're starting  to see some of those things.  So encroachment of new species.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:11:38):**  When this episode comes out, I'll actually be up in your part of the world later on in  the week for executive link, which is a continuation or ranching for profit.  I don't want this to turn into a sales pitch for Dallas because goodness knows.  
**[0:11:54-0:12:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:11:54):**  There's enough of it out there and there's enough of us that believe him.  But when I was up there, we were up there a few months ago back in November for our  first set of meetings.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:12:04):**  Normally our chapter meets in Colorado Springs, but COVID has displaced us to Rapid City,  which was kind of a nice change of pace, a little bit longer of a drive, but I'd never  seen that part of the world.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:12:15):**  I've never been up through Nebraska until then.  And I've never been to western, never been to South Dakota period, much less western  South Dakota and just driving in Rapid City was kind of interesting.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:12:26):**  We spent a few hours touring around on the triple seven bison ranch, which is a really  wonderful operation.  More to SB there.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:12:34):**  Maybe we'll get them on the podcast someday.  He's a really, really neat individual.  And then when we left, we left going to the east and got to see some other parts of it  
**[0:12:46-0:12:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:12:46):**  and some of Northern Nebraska and the Sandhills.  After driving through the Sandhills, I kind of see why everybody likes that part of the  world.  
**[0:12:53-0:13:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:12:53):**  Because it's a beautiful, nice.  Yeah, I'm going to keep my hills.  I wouldn't trade my red hills for him, but it's a really, really nice part of the world.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:13:02):**  So as much as I hate to, you know, we're going to go back and talk about Dallas Mount because  he's the next guy on our schedule to interview.  And as we record this, we're going to release this as episode zero.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:13:15):**  We already have five other episodes.  So those of you listeners that are just joining us and starting from zero, you may notice  a slight drop in audio quality, but I promise it'll come back by episode four.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:13:27):**  So Dallas was one of the guys that really promoted me and encouraged me to start my  podcast.  And I've been on your podcast several times, Clay.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:13:36):**  And every time we talk, you keep encouraging me.  And I'm glad I finally did it and I'm glad I have you here.  So why did you get started in podcasting?  
**[0:13:47-0:13:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:13:47):**  Dallas Mount.  So I was taking the High Plains Ranch practicum class and he said, you know, somebody in this  room needs to start a podcast.  
**[0:13:56-0:14:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:13:56):**  And I said, you know, I was thinking when he was saying that it's kind of one of those  moments where your stomach flips like, oh, I could do that because I've been around me.  Yeah, I've been around recording equipment.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:14:07):**  I've been around websites.  I've been around, you know, different versions, WordPress and some other some other websites.  So I kind of had the technical side wasn't as scary to me as it might have been for other  
**[0:14:19-0:14:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:14:19):**  people.  I just didn't know what I would talk about.  And I'd already been a podcast junkie.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:14:23):**  You know, I'd already listened to lots of podcasts by that time.  And so, yeah, Dallas said somebody should start a podcast for ranchers.  And I'm like, well, I grew up on a ranch.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:14:33):**  I can ask ask a semi intelligent question about cows and I can do the technology side.  All I've lacked is a topic and a network and ranching for profit gave me that network or  yeah, ranch practicum gave me that network.  
**[0:14:47-0:14:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:14:47):**  And every guest you interview seems to drop the names of three or four more that that  you could interview and add to the list.  And now the list is longer than than I'll ever seem seemingly longer than I'll ever  
**[0:14:59-0:15:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:14:59):**  get through.  And so it's been a been a great continuing education opportunity for me and a lot of  what I'm doing on my ranch right now is stuff that I learned through the podcast.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:15:10):**  So been a good, good experience for me.  I think we're, CK and I are both very excited to do this.  And, you know, we've done quite a few episodes and put them together in the last couple weeks.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:15:22):**  And it's like, we're almost just burning up to release and really excited about it.  We want to keep doing it, keep doing it.  But we realized we got to pace ourselves and be consistent and stick to a schedule.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:15:34):**  Yeah, that's the most important thing in podcasting is consistency.  So I think, get some of the other big things out of the way.  Keep releasing consistently and the following will show up and we'll grow and we'll share  
**[0:15:51-0:16:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:15:51):**  and talk about it.  So definitely a good strategy you've got there.  And earlier on the working cows portion, you mentioned that we have working cows 177, which  
**[0:16:02-0:16:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:16:02):**  is going to be coming up real soon and you're going to do that live.  Yeah, that's been a bucket list item for me for the working cows podcast is to do an episode  in front of a live audience.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:16:13):**  And so I don't know how many people will be there sitting in the seats to hear the interview.  But the opportunity will be there.  And I think that's all set, that's how we're going to do it.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:16:27):**  So I'm going to start promoting it and letting people know that they could come and partake  of that live recording because it's coming up from, when we're recording this, it's coming  up on Saturday that I'll be doing that.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:16:40):**  So it's an opportunity that I've been wanting to have and we're going to do an interview  about local meat production, local meat processing.  And then hopefully after the interview, there will be some, at least a couple of people  
**[0:16:54-0:17:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:16:54):**  sitting there listening and they will have questions and we'll have an opportunity for  a live Q&A.  So kind of an exciting deal.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:17:01):**  It's the Black Hills Stock Show.  So it's a fairly good sized rodeo and they show all classes of livestock there.  Beef, pigs, sheep, horses.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:17:14):**  The main thing of course, where we're at is the beef shows and they've got a day for each  breed pretty much.  I mean, not all of them, but they've got a Charolais day and an Angus day and a Hereford  
**[0:17:23-0:17:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:17:23):**  day.  And so there will be people there that we get the opportunity.  They'll be walking through the trade show portion of it, but there's a stage set up  
**[0:17:33-0:17:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:17:33):**  in the trade show.  And so hopefully some folks will sit down and hopefully there'll be some people who  hear about it on the front end and they come specifically for that.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:17:41):**  And they ask some questions because it's been something that I've wanted to do for a long  time and it finally warmed my way into the opportunity.  And maybe you've clarified this and I'm just a little bit confused that that's going to  
**[0:17:53-0:18:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:17:53):**  be recorded in front of a live audience, not necessarily recorded in broadcast live.  It might be broadcast live.  There are some, there's been some questions about that.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:18:05):**  The video adds a whole new wrinkle to podcasting.  So especially in a facility like that, we'd have to have access to a reliable wifi signal.  And then all I've got for a camera is just a webcam is what I use for Zoom calls like  
**[0:18:23-0:18:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:18:23):**  this.  And so I don't have a multi camera system that I could set up and all that stuff.  So it adds a few wrinkles.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:18:33):**  But if they want to do it live as a broadcast on the Facebook page for the South Dakota  Farm Bureau, Young Farmers and Ranchers, I'm willing to do that too.  But it's just something we'd have to consider the quality of, yes, big on quality.  
**[0:18:48-0:19:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:18:48):**  I can understand that, but doing it live and having a broadcast like radio show style.  I've done that twice now with the Extension 13 show with Everett and KJ.  They're just a ball of fun and that's a two hour live show and you get a three minute  
**[0:19:07-0:19:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:19:07):**  break every 30 minutes and that's it.  I mean, and you just, you got to roll, you got to be ready and you just got to go with  it.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:19:14):**  So it's a lot of fun to do one live.  I'd encourage you to try it sometime if you get the opportunity.  If you can't, even if it's not something you're going to do video, maybe at least try to release  
**[0:19:27-0:19:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:19:27):**  the audio live.  I think that would be fantastic and it'd be a good experience.  I had a lot of fun doing it.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:19:33):**  I've done a few of these recordings as though they were live.  With all of when I say the episode number first and then I go into my intro music and  then I fade that out and intro the guest and then transition straight to the guest and  
**[0:19:52-0:20:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:19:52):**  then bring in the outro music after the interview.  So I've done a couple of those and I'm getting more and more comfortable with it all the  time but this will be the first one where people actually have the potential to walk  
**[0:20:01-0:20:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:20:01):**  by and sit down and listen in and interact.  So I'm sure there will be some butterflies there, but I'm looking forward to it.  Maybe it might be just as simple as having somebody out in the crowd with a phone and  
**[0:20:14-0:20:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:20:14):**  a good microphone to point at you and live streaming on Facebook and in your Facebook  group.  Yep.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:20:20):**  That's true.  And what day will that be?  It is Saturday, January 30th, I believe.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:20:27):**  Nope, Saturday.  Yep.  January 30th.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:20:30):**  My daughter, my only daughter's birthday.  So I only have four kids, one girl.  Your favorite daughter.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:20:35):**  Oh, wow.  So that one's already going to be, you'll already have that laid down by the time this  comes out.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:20:40):**  Yes, sir.  Yep.  Great.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:20:43):**  So you were mentioning that Dallas didn't need any more advertising and that brings  to my mind the disparity that I experience in some of the different circles that I run  in.  
**[0:20:57-0:21:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:20:57):**  It seems like the South Dakota Grassland Coalition or Ranching for Profit or any of those names  get mentioned and it's instantly full to capacity.  And then some of the other organizations that I am connected to or try to start things for,  
**[0:21:12-0:21:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:21:12):**  try to participate in, it's like pulling teeth to get people to show up.  And I think that just goes a long ways to talk about the desire of people for a different  way of operating and a way of operating that starts with the premise of let's do this profitably.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:21:32):**  Let's do this and make money at it and increase the...  Right, like a business.  Yeah.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:21:38):**  And increase the enjoyment that our family experiences as a result, I think so.  And that's key.  Quality of life.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:21:46):**  I think quality of life lacks for a lot of people in the industry, not just in the cattle  industry, but overall in the ag sector, I think there's a lot of people that suffer  a good quality of life.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:21:59):**  Yeah, absolutely.  It can be.  I think one of the things that came to my mind the other day was you can either partner  
**[0:22:11-0:22:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:22:11):**  with mother nature or she can be your enemy.  And if she's your enemy, I think you're going to lose.  You probably aren't going to win that fight.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:22:20):**  And so if we can structure our businesses in a way that mother nature becomes a partner  rather than the adversary, I think that we're setting ourselves up for a greater chance  of success than if we're trying to fight against the way that this world was designed to work.  
**[0:22:44-0:23:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:22:44):**  Right.  So can you tell me, is there a myth about you that you'd like to debunk or maybe a myth  about the industry that you'd like to debunk?  
**[0:23:00-0:23:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:23:00):**  Myths about me.  The first question anybody asked me that recognized me at Ranching for Profit was, do people treat  you like a celebrity?  
**[0:23:07-0:23:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:23:07):**  And I said, no, just go ask my wife.  I don't deserve that.  She'll tell you that I don't deserve that.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:23:12):**  So yeah, I don't know about myths about me.  I haven't, I guess I haven't heard much that if you have a specific one in mind, I can  probably debunk it.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:23:26):**  No, I will say it does.  Sometimes it is interesting the places that you get recognized in public.  Your voice is probably pretty recognizable.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:23:37):**  My face is all over social media all the time.  So I get recognized in some odd places every once in a while.  Yep.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:23:46):**  So I was at a Cor Blund concert one time and I think I was having a conversation with a  guy in the hallway waiting to go into the bathroom actually.  And somebody comes walking out of the bathroom says, Clay Connery.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:23:59):**  I'm like, you didn't even see me.  You just heard my voice.  This is creepy.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:24:03):**  And that was like, really early on.  I think Cor Blund was episode 32 or something like that.  And I had interviewed him before the show.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:24:11):**  And so somebody recognized me and I was like, man, this is getting weird.  So myths about the industry, you have a specific one in mind?  No, not really.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:24:27):**  Well, I think kind of back to that one that we talked about earlier, that it's hard to  get started.  Granted, I do have a job that pays my bills.  
**[0:24:38-0:25:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:24:38):**  But I think I have come up with a fairly reasonably sized scale business model and plan that could  replace my income and do it in six months.  And so if I could replace my income with six months of hosting somebody else's cows on  
**[0:25:05-0:25:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:25:05):**  somebody else's land, that leaves six other months that I could do something else to make  up any difference in that.  And so I think-  
**[0:25:17-0:25:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:25:17):**  Miami on a Record podcast.  Yeah.  Cows, cows, Florida.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:25:22):**  That's my crop rotation.  Cows, cows, Florida.  So no, I think that there's opportunity to get started if we're willing to think about  
**[0:25:30-0:25:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:25:30):**  what it takes to get started, what it means to be a rancher.  If we're willing to think about those things a little differently, I think there's opportunity  for sure.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:25:37):**  I guess now that I think about it for a minute, the myth would be the myth that we can't feed  the world with regenerative agriculture.  We touched on that earlier in the conversation.  
**[0:25:50-0:26:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:25:50):**  And I don't think anybody can really sit down and do the hard math.  But we don't even have a third of the number of head of cattle that existed as bison.  And when the bison were here, there was just absolutely ridiculous amounts of grass under  
**[0:26:10-0:26:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:26:10):**  natural management.  And I'm sure that people might want to debate about that.  But the moral of the story is if there were three times as many bison as there are cattle  
**[0:26:20-0:26:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:26:20):**  now, it's a little bit disingenuous to say that we can't raise enough beef on the grassland  and the prairies to meet the demand that we're currently meeting with the production CAFO  model.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:26:35):**  And I think it's Lewis and Clark, their expedition.  They talk about being able to tie the grass in knots over top of their saddles in some  of those tall grass prairie contexts.  
**[0:26:49-0:27:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:26:49):**  That's how much just biomass there was out there in those contexts under natural management  or under the fouling effect, moving those herds on from one place to the next.  And as Alan Savory posits, the wolves keeping them or the coyotes wolves, whatever predators  
**[0:27:11-0:27:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:27:11):**  there were, keeping them in tight bunches so that you get the herd effect and the impact  of the animal density and stuff like that.  So under that management regime, if we can recreate that with our own management using  
**[0:27:28-0:27:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:27:28):**  the hot wire as the predator and the fouling effect to move them on to fresh ground every  day under our own plan, then maybe we can see some of that increased production come  back.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:27:44):**  Be the wolf.  Be the wolf with your polly wire.  Yep.  
**[0:27:49-0:27:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:27:49):**  Yep.  And I know there are people who have grazed without a back fence and the fouling effect  works until a heavy rain comes and sanitizes the field.  
**[0:27:58-0:28:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:27:58):**  And then they do start to go back and try to graze some of that stuff they grazed two,  three, four, five days ago.  And so I think that that's another opportunity to reduce the...  
**[0:28:12-0:28:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:28:12):**  If you live in a place like I do, where you don't get a lot of rain, that's another place  where you could probably reduce some labor and reduce some infrastructure costs, but  you're probably still going to need that back fence at some point when the rain is coming.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:28:27):**  And in a different year, wetter or drier year or a year where you have what some people  are calling sun drought, you have to adjust.  The management adjusts every year and the term that we've been throwing around in some  
**[0:28:41-0:28:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:28:41):**  of the other episodes that we've already recorded is contextually appropriate management.  And that follows back to the sixth principle of soil health that we have to consider the  context.  
**[0:28:52-0:29:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:28:52):**  Yeah, absolutely.  I sat in Ranching for Profit with an individual from coastal Texas who gets four or five times  as much rain as I do in a year.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:29:06):**  And so what works in his place isn't going to work where I'm at and what works where  I am isn't going to work where he is.  But we've got to not look at that as something that we are a victim of our circumstances.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:29:19):**  We got to look at that as an opportunity.  My context presents me with opportunities that his context doesn't.  And I need to maximize the opportunities that my context is presenting me with and minimize  
**[0:29:34-0:29:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:29:34):**  the challenges.  But it's easy and I think it's the default setting for a lot of agriculture to just become  the victim of their circumstances, of their context rather than being as Ranching for  
**[0:29:50-0:30:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:29:50):**  Profit would put it accountable.  And I was thinking while I was sitting there, I was thinking we could rather than being  victims, we could be victors, but ultimately if we're fighting mother nature, sometimes  
**[0:30:01-0:30:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:30:01):**  we are going to lose and sometimes things won't go like we want to.  But if we've got a plan in place, we don't have to be victims.  We can be accountable.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:30:09):**  We can maybe even border on being victors over those circumstances and situations if  we've got a solid drought plan in place and we actually get over the sentimental aspects  of putting it into practice.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:30:30):**  So what was your experience managing through drought, Brian, because I think I'm about  to be in the same boat?  Well, put them in one bunch, keep them moving.  
**[0:30:44-0:31:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:30:44):**  Try to stretch out your rest days in front of your more critical.  Right now if you're facing drought, make sure you're adequately stocked.  You mentioned a drought plan coming out of Ranching for Profit.  
**[0:31:00-0:31:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:31:00):**  I'd say having a drought plan is absolutely a critical part of being in the cattle business.  If you're in a cattle business and you don't have a plan for what to do in case of drought  or your plan simply is go start the feed pickup and start hauling hay, that's not a plan.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:31:18):**  You need to have a plan on how are you going to manage your forage and how you're going  to manage your livestock.  And if you don't have enough word for the amount of livestock, you need to have a plan  
**[0:31:27-0:31:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:31:27):**  to identify that drought situation early so you can de-stock before your neighbors and  still get a good price.  Because if you wait till everybody else realizes they're in a drought, you just might as well  
**[0:31:40-0:31:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:31:40):**  give them away.  Yep.  I've got an A herd, a B herd and a C herd in place.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:31:45):**  The A herd is my sheep.  The B herd is my cows and the C herd is the neighbor's cows.  So the first ones to go are those ones.  
**[0:31:58-0:32:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:31:58):**  So why are you keeping the sheep over all the cows or the rest of the cows?  Gross margin per unit is better.  So I've still got to figure out a low labor way to graze them at scale.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:32:11):**  That's the do list.  That was the number one thing on my action plan coming out of Ranching for Profit was  a low labor way to graze sheep and had a phone call today that I think is a promising option.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:32:24):**  So I'm going to look into that.  Yeah.  I'm just going to call Dallas and tell him that he owes me a dollar for every time somebody  
**[0:32:33-0:32:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:32:33):**  says Ranching for Profit on this podcast.  I know.  Because range markets though, right?  
**[0:32:40-0:32:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:32:40):**  They are paying the bills.  And I think it's crazy when people don't want to even entertain the option of having that  species on the ranch or even starting with them.  
**[0:32:50-0:32:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:32:50):**  Like it's sometimes taboo.  It's like, I can't believe you said that dirty S word.  Like it's not that dirty guys.  
**[0:32:56-0:33:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:32:56):**  Like I'm going to make you some money.  Well, you've had several great episodes of people talking about grazing sheep.  And I remember there was one guy that had a good point about, we keep the sheep out  
**[0:33:06-0:33:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:33:06):**  the back to pay for the cows that everybody loves.  But then we put the horses out by the road for the tourists.  And I think that there's a lot of truth to that and studying some of the history of the  
**[0:33:19-0:33:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:33:19):**  land that I operate.  It was paid for with sheep back in the old 30s, 40s and 50s.  And I think that's, I don't know that I've come across a place where that isn't true.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:33:31):**  Honestly, my dad always told me that he said everything north and west of Belle Fourche,  South Dakota, where I grew up, was paid for with sheep.  And then I come out here and I'm east, I'm northeast of Belle Fourche, South Dakota.  
**[0:33:42-0:33:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:33:42):**  And everybody out here says, well, this is all paid for with sheep.  And a lot of them, as soon as the land and the livestock were paid for, the sheep went  to town.  
**[0:33:52-0:34:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:33:52):**  And a lot of them were struggling with predators too.  But there's still places that are stocked at least 50% of their ranch is stocked with  sheep in here.  
**[0:34:02-0:34:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:34:02):**  But they're the ones that are running guardian dogs with their sheep.  So it's a challenge.  It's they're not as an easy of an animal to graze as a cow is.  
**[0:34:14-0:34:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:34:14):**  But it's a good business model, especially in my opinion, the wool sheep.  I'm in a place where wool is worth something.  Right.  
**[0:34:23-0:34:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:34:23):**  Or time to come and do it.  The Newell Market at one time was the biggest sheep market in the world.  And the Belle Fourche wool market was at one time might still be the largest wool market  
**[0:34:36-0:34:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:34:36):**  in the world.  So, I don't have trouble finding somebody to come share my sheep.  And I don't have trouble finding a place to take the wool once I've got it off of the  
**[0:34:45-0:34:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:34:45):**  sheep.  A lot of people in other places I've talked to said we share the sheep and then we just  throw the wool off to the side because nobody will take it.  
**[0:34:53-0:35:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:34:53):**  And we don't haul it far enough to get it sold.  So it's not a liability where I'm at.  It's an asset.  
**[0:35:01-0:35:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:35:01):**  So just another little addition to that gross margin per unit line that probably really  helps pay the bills.  So let's get into the sheep and cattle grazing a little bit for the people that aren't familiar.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:35:14):**  Talk about how sheep graze versus how cattle graze and how they compete for forage.  As far as I understand it, there is no competition.  They graze enough different from each other that you can run one cow to one sheep and  
**[0:35:30-0:35:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:35:30):**  not notice any.  And that's a very conservative estimate.  As I understand it, you can run one cow to one sheep on your ranch and not notice any  
**[0:35:39-0:35:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:35:39):**  anything taken from the cows by the sheep.  So same internal gut mechanism for processing that grass.  But you prefer a little bit more lignified grass or species of plant than the cows do.  
**[0:35:57-0:36:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:35:57):**  So they go after some of the weeds.  And then goats are even farther on the other side of that.  They're more, they prefer the woody species.  
**[0:36:06-0:36:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:36:06):**  They prefer the, you know, they prefer to browse more like a deer.  And so that's an opportunity, I think, that goes unrealized in a lot of scenarios and  might be another opportunity.  
**[0:36:22-0:36:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:36:22):**  So my business model, my preferred business model, what I'd like to get to is take about  50% of my ranch's stocking rate or carrying, my ranch's carrying capacity and have that  be sheep there year round, and then bring in somebody else's cows for the growing season  
**[0:36:41-0:36:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:36:41):**  to take off the other 50% of the carrying capacity.  And so then that becomes the de-stocking strategy as well, is if the stock days per acre per  inch of rain gets too far above that line of what we're able to bear, the custom grazing  
**[0:36:58-0:37:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:36:58):**  cattle go first.  Go home to keep the forage available for the moneymakers.  That's right.  
**[0:37:05-0:37:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:37:05):**  I like it.  I like it.  So what are five things you can't live without?  
**[0:37:12-0:37:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:37:12):**  I'll answer the easy version of that.  Amanda, Brayden, Calvin, Charlie, and Glover, those are my wife and my kids.  As far as ranching is concerned, they are a big part of it.  
**[0:37:30-0:37:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:37:30):**  As the kids get older, I want to get them more involved, give them more responsibility,  not just look at them as free labor, but try to train them to become ranch managers if  they want to, if they want to pursue that.  
**[0:37:45-0:38:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:37:45):**  And so I want to give them those opportunities and give them responsibility.  Maybe someday they're the ones that are responsible for executing the grazing plan.  Shoot, maybe someday they're the ones responsible for developing the grazing plan.  
**[0:38:01-0:38:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:38:01):**  That's some great homeschool math opportunity, if you ask me.  So I want to give them as much responsibility as they want in that regard and continue to  challenge them with the opportunity to be trained as ranch managers.  
**[0:38:19-0:38:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:38:19):**  As far as tools, I can't live without.  My podcast has been a big continuing education tool for me.  The network that it has given me, I just got off the phone this morning with a sheep producer  
**[0:38:33-0:38:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:38:33):**  in Tennessee on my action plan coming out of the most recent school that I went to.  If we don't want to cost Dallas too much money here, is one of those things on that action  plan was to call him and say, hey, how are you grazing your sheep?  
**[0:38:50-0:39:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:38:50):**  How are you doing this in a low labor way?  And so his answer was two hot wires is enough to keep a sheep in.  And I'm doing that right now on the bale grazing.  
**[0:39:03-0:39:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:39:03):**  They're in three hot wires on one side and then the other two sides are electric net  fencing.  And so they haven't challenged that three hot wires yet.  
**[0:39:12-0:39:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:39:12):**  So I'm sure we could do it with two.  I was being lazy this fall on the swath grazing.  I didn't want to build a two wire fence.  
**[0:39:20-0:39:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:39:20):**  So I was trying to keep cows and sheep in together with one wire.  And if it was low enough to keep the sheep in, the cows would step over it.  So I just need to get over my laziness and go build two wires for my sheep and get them  
**[0:39:33-0:39:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:39:33):**  contained that way.  So that leads me to another indispensable tool.  A good fence charger.  
**[0:39:41-0:39:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:39:41):**  I run a Stafix X6i right now.  And the I is important because that comes with a remote.  And it's a dual charger.  
**[0:39:54-0:40:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:39:54):**  And I've had up to a mile and a half of poly wire and I think five or six panels of electric  net fence.  And then I've got a mile long high tensile spine fence.  
**[0:40:11-0:40:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:40:11):**  So I've had all of that hooked up to that six jewel charger at once and still had eight  plus nine thousand volts in it.  So yeah, that's another indispensable tool.  
**[0:40:27-0:40:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:40:27):**  A good geared reel is another indispensable tool.  Say that again to make sure people heard that.  A good geared reel.  
**[0:40:37-0:40:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:40:37):**  That's a three to one geared reel.  So you don't wear out your shoulder joint rolling up that reel.  And good poly braid.  
**[0:40:47-0:41:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:40:47):**  I actually do kind of like the six wire or six strand poly braid from Power Flex because  you can get a half a mile of that comfortably on a third mile reel or on a smaller geared  reel.  
**[0:41:05-0:41:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:41:05):**  So that's the same stuff I use for the same reason.  It's good stuff.  Yep.  
**[0:41:09-0:41:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:41:09):**  And I think you were the one who said it on my podcast.  You said if my cows think that that wire is hot, they'll stay in behind dental floss.  And honestly, that's what that six strand poly wire looks like.  
**[0:41:22-0:41:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:41:22):**  It looks like dental floss.  But I honestly, I think I can say this honestly, I never had a cow out or a livestock critter.  No, I never had a cow.  
**[0:41:32-0:41:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:41:32):**  I never had a bovine out of a fence that was hot.  And I never ran them in more than one wire.  I had them go out of the hot wire fence through the four wire barbed wire fence.  
**[0:41:48-0:42:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:41:48):**  I did have that happen, but they didn't go out through the hot wire.  So we had those animals there for 90 days on our place and they were never out of that  wire when it was hot.  
**[0:42:02-0:42:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:42:02):**  So it's a great tool.  I don't know how many tools I'm up to right now, but I'm going to keep going.  I think a transect, a square like mine's made out of PVC pipe, just some PVC pipe I had  
**[0:42:17-0:42:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:42:17):**  laying around from making my kids a roping dummy.  I made it into a transect square.  I think it's three feet by three feet.  
**[0:42:24-0:42:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:42:24):**  And then a long tape measure to run that square through and a shovel to stick in the middle  of that transect and see what the soil looks like.  So I didn't get as many of those done as I wanted to this year, but I did get one done  
**[0:42:40-0:42:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:42:40):**  in a fairly crucial spot.  So it was some of the worst ground, the most abused ground that we had.  And so I'm looking forward to going back to that spot year after year.  
**[0:42:50-0:42:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:42:50):**  And one of the parts of that tool is the grass snap app.  I think it's available everywhere.  I got it on the store.  
**[0:42:59-0:43:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:42:59):**  It's done by University of Nebraska Lincoln, as far as I know, and it'll GPS tag your picture  and it'll let you add a certain number of pictures to each one of those places.  So you can go and look at your screen and see this is GPS reading is the same as the  
**[0:43:12-0:43:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:43:12):**  one from last year.  And you can get right back to that exact spot and take those transects to see some of the  gains you're making.  
**[0:43:20-0:43:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:43:20):**  So I think that those are some of the best.  Oh, my 1998 four wheeler.  I've got a 1998 Yamaha big bear 350 saves me a lot of steps.  
**[0:43:32-0:43:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:43:32):**  Makes the whole process of moving critters faster.  And at this point, it's the it's the UTV I can afford.  You start where you are.  
**[0:43:44-0:44:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:43:44):**  That's right.  So what are what are some of your cheat codes and hacks that you've learned in the last  three four years and 175 episodes now of working cows podcast regarding grazing, anything grazing  
**[0:44:00-0:44:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:44:00):**  life, cows, sheep?  Sure.  Share some knowledge.  
**[0:44:07-0:44:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:44:07):**  From a grazing perspective, I think that the Oh, man, I'm gonna forget what's the name  the plas and quick connect.  I think those things are good if you're not moving your water infrastructure.  
**[0:44:20-0:44:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:44:20):**  If you're going to move your water infrastructure, I would recommend going with a going with  a Oh, man, what's a cam lock fitting?  I'd recommend going with a cam lock fitting if you're going to move your infrastructure,  
**[0:44:32-0:44:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:44:32):**  because I had a few of those plas and quick connects kind of disintegrate on me.  So I went to I think I went with the aluminum, the aluminum cam lock fittings on all the  stuff that I'm taking apart and putting back together regularly, like every day or every  
**[0:44:48-0:45:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:44:48):**  other day.  So I that was that was one of the things that I learned this year made a big mess in a couple  of spots that I'm kind of also looking forward to see how those recover because very, very  
**[0:45:01-0:45:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:45:01):**  plugged up, stomped into nothing kind of ground.  And so it'll be interesting to see how that comes back in the years to come.  Other hacks, other things I have learned, the cows, they have a brain.  
**[0:45:19-0:45:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:45:19):**  And if we are willing to let them use it, they will do better than we can at choosing  their own forage.  Now that's a that's an advantage and a disadvantage because we can have overgrazing and undergrazing  
**[0:45:32-0:45:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:45:32):**  happening in the same pasture if we let them go back and choose the best available forage  over and over again.  But if we use that hot wire as the wolf to move them on to the next spot, they won't  
**[0:45:45-0:45:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:45:45):**  have the freedom to make that choice of the best available forage over and over again.  Non-collective.  Non-selective grazing, they'll get to go out.  
**[0:45:54-0:46:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:45:54):**  And as I saw, again, some of the cool things about this year's season of management was  getting to see all the things that I saw people talk about on the podcast come to fruition.  Like when we were moving every day or even when we're moving every other day, they were  
**[0:46:12-0:46:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:46:12):**  just taking the top thirds of those plants and not returning for a second bite.  And then we remove them on and they'd go in and do the same thing over and over again,  just taking the top third of that plant to the point that I think if I understood the  
**[0:46:24-0:46:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:46:24):**  day that I sat in the sale ring and watch those yearlings sell those yearlings that  I had were the light cut of the replacement yearlings or replacement heifers.  And I think if I understood how that all worked out, those girls that were at my place outperformed  
**[0:46:41-0:46:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:46:41):**  and maybe even outweighed the ones that they had selected for the replacement heifers who  were the bigger, better looking animals to start with.  So it was a good opportunity.  
**[0:46:55-0:47:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:46:55):**  And it's not about me, it's just about this style of management and it works if you're  willing to get outside of your box and your comfort zone to that zone of opportunity to  learn.  
**[0:47:08-0:47:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:47:08):**  And the way we go to learn things is outside of our comfort zone, we don't learn much inside  of our comfort zone.  Right.  
**[0:47:16-0:47:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:47:16):**  So earlier, you mentioned something about plastin valves and I had a couple of, I wouldn't  necessarily call them failures with the valves.  It was more of an engineering failure that we had to work around.  
**[0:47:31-0:47:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:47:31):**  I wasn't moving my plastin valves that much or my pipelines that much.  It was about a once a week move or once every 10 days is about how often we would actually  move the tank and you'll break the plastin and reconnect it.  
**[0:47:43-0:47:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:47:43):**  But I can definitely see your point if you're moving it every day that that plastin will  take a lot of wear.  I did have one start leaking that I had to take out of service, but fortunately I had  
**[0:47:53-0:48:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:47:53):**  a spare.  So you're just talking about cows and heifers.  Let's talk about your ideal cow.  
**[0:48:02-0:48:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:48:02):**  I mean, you have gained some of the fantastic guests like Steve Campbell just a couple of  weeks ago, I think that was 160.  That was just absolutely fantastic.  
**[0:48:12-0:48:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:48:12):**  So what's your, describe your ideal cow or what would be, what's your position agreement  or job description for a cow?  It's a working cow, Brian.  
**[0:48:28-0:48:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:48:28):**  It's a cow.  Interesting.  It's a cow that goes to work.  
**[0:48:32-0:48:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:48:32):**  It's a cow that doesn't require a lot of crutches, a lot of inputs to keep her on the place.  And honestly, I'm not smart enough, I don't think to figure out when and where to put  those crutches.  
**[0:48:50-0:49:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:48:50):**  Although I think there are, I'm having my own paradigms challenged in that regard.  There are some times when supplementation strategically done and thought through can  really net some good gains and some good positive return on investment, but it doesn't need  
**[0:49:05-0:49:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:49:05):**  to be there all the time.  We need to look at kind of the forage cycle on our place and say, when is this cow going  to be short on groceries?  
**[0:49:14-0:49:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:49:14):**  Do we need to supplement there rather than substitute?  Those are two different things.  Do we need to supplement there and kind of give her the opportunity to perform at a high  
**[0:49:25-0:49:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:49:25):**  level?  And that's a decision that has to be made with some economic analysis and some cashflow  planning and different things like that.  
**[0:49:34-0:49:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:49:34):**  But I want a cow that goes to work.  I want a cow that, as Jim Garish says, rustles her own grub.  And I guess my responsibility in that is to give her grub to rustle.  
**[0:49:47-0:50:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:49:47):**  And I think the best way I know to do that is to shorten the graze period, increase the  rest period, and continue to move to fresh forage regularly.  And if I do that, if I keep fresh forage in front of her, or maybe not even fresh, but  
**[0:50:04-0:50:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:50:04):**  well-managed forage in front of her, that's another thing I'm looking forward to entertaining  as a possibility is that idea of grazing it up, graze that forage real lightly once and  get some of that energy into the roots and see that energy come back out through the  
**[0:50:25-0:50:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:50:25):**  top in a low rainfall environment like I'm in.  I'm still trying to work through the best way to accomplish that, especially when we  dried off at the end of last summer and have stayed dry all the way through the winter.  
**[0:50:38-0:50:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:50:38):**  This spring we'll tell what that's going to be like, but I'm entertaining the idea of  a graze it up pass on the land that I want to graze in the winter, the stockpiled forage  that I want to use.  
**[0:50:52-0:51:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:50:52):**  So anyways, I think if I'm doing my part to keep a well-managed forage in front of her  and doing my part to keep water accessible to her and salt and mineral, although that's  another paradigm that I'm having challenged, I really want to get some certain individuals  
**[0:51:11-0:51:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:51:11):**  on the podcast to talk about how we should think about water or how we should think about  mineral and salt.  And so I haven't gotten them tracked down yet, so I won't mention any names, but there's  
**[0:51:23-0:51:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:51:23):**  some pretty interesting ways of thinking about it.  And it goes along with Steve Campbell in the class that I took with him at the Wedge Tent  Angus Ranch.  
**[0:51:33-0:51:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:51:33):**  They put on the class and I went to that.  So if I'm doing my part to keep well-managed forage and water and salt and mineral, whatever  that looks like in front of her, then the rest is up to her, honestly.  
**[0:51:46-0:52:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:51:46):**  She needs to bring a calf to weaning.  If I'm doing my part, she needs to do her part and her part is to bring calf to weaning,  stay in good body condition score and get bred on time for the calving period that we  
**[0:52:02-0:52:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:52:02):**  are going to put ourselves in.  So if she doesn't do that, then she can find somewhere else to go to work is kind of how  I think about it.  
**[0:52:11-0:52:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:52:11):**  Your job code.  Yeah.  Recode your job.  
**[0:52:18-0:52:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:52:18):**  What kind of cow is that?  I don't know.  I'm not smart enough to figure that out.  
**[0:52:24-0:52:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:52:24):**  She'll prove it to me by doing the things in her job description, her effectiveness  areas.  She'll prove it if she might surprise me.  
**[0:52:36-0:52:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:52:36):**  Maybe she's a lot bigger than the rest of my cows, but she comes in in good body condition,  bred with a calf at her side every year at weaning time.  If she can keep doing that, I don't see any reason why I should tell her that she has  
**[0:52:49-0:53:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:52:49):**  to go work somewhere else.  As long as they fit within the phenotype you're looking for and she does her job.  They get a stay, they get a meal ticket and there's no point in keeping an animal that  
**[0:53:00-0:53:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:53:00):**  doesn't.  It's what we're doing if we're in the cow calf business.  We're in that business.  
**[0:53:08-0:53:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:53:08):**  We're not in the business of making excuses for animals who underperform.  So they can do their part.  You build a lot of electric fence and you've got a lot of recent experience with building  
**[0:53:21-0:53:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:53:21):**  electric fence.  What's your best tip for electric fence?  You talked about your energizer that has a remote and I'm a little jealous of that.  
**[0:53:31-0:53:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:53:31):**  It doesn't necessarily work for me because I have so many miles of fence and I've got  nine different chargers.  It's not necessarily practical for me to say.  
**[0:53:43-0:53:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:53:43):**  I have bat latches.  I cheat.  Those are cool.  
**[0:53:49-0:54:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:53:49):**  So other than the fence charger and the remote, what's your best tip for electric fence?  What's your best tip to keep that much fence hot?  Get it grounded right.  
**[0:54:00-0:54:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:54:00):**  I think that's the first thing that you've got to do.  Dallas Mount said, when you get that fence charger in the mail, it comes with an instruction  manual.  
**[0:54:10-0:54:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:54:10):**  Read that because the grounding is the big part that people might take for granted or  might not pay attention to.  I think there's some grounding strategies that you can use, like putting your ground  
**[0:54:20-0:54:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:54:20):**  rod on the north side of a building where that water is going to drip off and it's going  to stay cool because it's not in the sun, at least if you're in the northern hemisphere.  Like I am well into the northern hemisphere, it's going to stay cooler on that north side  
**[0:54:37-0:54:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:54:37):**  of the building.  It's not going to dry out as fast.  It's going to stay wetter and get better moisture more consistently and stay nice and moist  
**[0:54:47-0:55:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:54:47):**  and good contact for the ground.  I think push the envelope on post spacing is another one.  I had a few times when my post spacing with a step in post, I was using O'Brien step in  
**[0:55:01-0:55:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:55:01):**  posts.  With a step in post, my post spacing sometimes was in the neighborhood of 100 feet and still  kept them in.  
**[0:55:10-0:55:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:55:10):**  I was more comfortable with 60 feet.  These are on spots that had been hayed forever.  So it's not, that tells you something about the terrain of that land.  
**[0:55:22-0:55:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:55:22):**  I really like the O'Brien step in post, especially in contrast to its knockoff look alike counterparts  at the farm store.  Don't buy those, please.  
**[0:55:32-0:55:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:55:32):**  Yeah, please don't.  You'll hate yourself.  I heard people talk about that, like the 3 sixteenths of an inch spade or spike at the  
**[0:55:43-0:55:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:55:43):**  bottom of that O'Brien step in post and it is actually high tensile.  That's a big thing that it's high tensile.  It's a big thing that it's a three sixteenths of an inch instead of whatever the other ones  
**[0:55:55-0:56:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:55:55):**  are half an inch or five eighths.  And then it's a big thing that it's got a big tread plate on it to step in.  So I didn't realize that until somebody dropped off some farm store versions for me and you're  
**[0:56:10-0:56:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:56:10):**  like, yeah, five eighths of an inch or whatever that spike is in a tiny little tread plate,  nowhere to step.  So those are some of the things that I'm like, oh, this really does make a huge difference.  
**[0:56:24-0:56:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:56:24):**  And right now we're stepping those into frozen ground here in western South Dakota in January  and having good success with it.  And even this summer when we were hot and dry, never really thought to get an O'Brien  
**[0:56:40-0:56:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:56:40):**  step in post in the ground.  So those are some of the things that I really, really appreciated and got to see how well  they actually work if you have good, good quality, quality, right.  
**[0:56:54-0:57:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:56:54):**  So the quality of your equipment is going to make a difference.  And like I said, I have Gallagher reels.  That was the first one I ever bought was a Gallagher Maxi reel, even though somebody  
**[0:57:08-0:57:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:57:08):**  told me not to and I should have listened.  So now I like the third mile reel with a single hook and the lock.  The lock is important for a house reel, being able to lock them down.  
**[0:57:19-0:57:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:57:19):**  And I probably will continue to order the third mile reel with the six strand PowerFlex.  So I think that worked well enough.  I don't see any reason not to order it.  
**[0:57:31-0:57:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:57:31):**  And then I prefer, especially if I'm going to start grazing sheep in just a couple of  hot wires.  I prefer the O'Brien step in post for, like I said, the size of the spike, the size of  
**[0:57:45-0:57:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:57:45):**  the tread plate, all those things make a big difference.  They're legitimate quality things that you should take into consideration when you buy  them.  
**[0:57:54-0:57:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:57:54):**  And it has attachment points at various heights.  Right.  Yep.  
**[0:57:59-0:58:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:57:59):**  And I think, whereas I use the Gallagher ring tops and they are where they are, they're  about waist height and they're just kind of generally for cows.  And if you want to do sheep, then you need to look at a different solution.  
**[0:58:12-0:58:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:58:12):**  Those O'Brien posts, the $1, $1.25 Sloan O'Brien posts at the farm store.  I made that mistake too.  And I tell you what, if you're going to try to rotation graze or run reels with those  
**[0:58:28-0:58:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:58:28):**  cheap posts, you will hate life.  Like it got down to where they're just kind of good for stress relief.  Like when I need to blow off some steam, I just grab one and I go out and I beat on a  
**[0:58:37-0:58:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:58:37):**  tree and it explodes in a million pieces.  And I feel a little bit better.  Actually our local farm store is selling a Runnings or not a Runnings.  
**[0:58:47-0:59:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:58:47):**  That's the farm store that I was trying to avoid saying the name of.  They are selling a Gallagher multi-wire ring top posts.  So it's actually a Gallagher product and it has clips going down for multiple wires.  
**[0:59:03-0:59:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:59:03):**  So there's people seeing the need for that niche, the need in the market for that to  be fulfilled.  And they're starting to meet that demand.  
**[0:59:12-0:59:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:59:12):**  So I think there's opportunity out there to maybe for some other players in that space.  But right now though, two I know of are the Gallagher ring top with the multi-wire and  then the O'Brien step in post.  
**[0:59:27-0:59:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:59:27):**  Great.  So I think we're kind of getting close to our time today.  We've been going for quite a while doing this crossover episode and it's been a lot of fun.  
**[0:59:41-0:59:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:59:41):**  So we'll turn it over to you to ask a few questions.  What's your one tip for making the world a better place?  Where can anybody start to put that lever in to pull it to start to get its movement?  
**[0:59:55-1:00:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=0:59:55):**  Well, I'm a Jesus guy and he said that the whole of the Old Testament was summed up with  two things, love God with all your heart, soul, mind and strength, and love your neighbor  as yourself.  
**[1:00:07-1:00:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=1:00:07):**  And I focus on that last one.  I think we have gotten so siloed in this country and everything has been politicized.  And so I go home and I turn on Tucker Carlson and wait for him to tell me who I need to  
**[1:00:20-1:00:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=1:00:20):**  hate today rather than going out and actually meeting my neighbor and interacting with people  not in a rally context, not where I'm holding my signup that says that person's dumb and  they're holding their signup that says I'm dumb, where I go out and I actually meet them  
**[1:00:37-1:00:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=1:00:37):**  across the fence and talk about actual issues.  So I think that's my way to make the world a better place is to meet your neighbors and  to get to know them as people before you know them as a political party, adherent.  
**[1:00:54-1:01:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=1:00:54):**  And I think back to what you were saying earlier about shake the hand that feeds you, that's  just another way of saying the same thing.  Awesome.  
**[1:01:06-1:01:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=1:01:06):**  Awesome.  It's been a lot of fun.  Clay, is there anything you want to turn around and ask CK or I?  
**[1:01:14-1:01:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=1:01:14):**  Oh man, we spent an hour doing that earlier.  We did, didn't we?  Yeah, we did.  
**[1:01:19-1:01:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=1:01:19):**  Come back to the beginning.  I thank you for the opportunity.  I will say check out ranchingpodcast.com.  
**[1:01:29-1:01:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=1:01:29):**  That'll take you to the episodes page of the Working Cows Podcast and every single episode  ever is on there that I've ever done is on there.  And so there's bound to be a topic there that you are interested in currently and you can  
**[1:01:44-1:01:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=1:01:44):**  find them.  If you want suggestions for guests, you can find me through my website as well and send  me an email and recommend some guests that I should be talking to.  
**[1:01:54-1:02:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=1:01:54):**  So I can't think of any specific questions right now that I would have to ask, but I'm  glad that you've started a new podcast.  We need more and I'm really glad it's you two individuals who are starting this one.  
**[1:02:11-1:02:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=1:02:11):**  Player, I really want to thank you for your encouragement and your support.  It means a lot to me and we've had a lot of fun.  The last two hours, we've had a lot of fun with the recordings that we've done that we're  
**[1:02:23-1:02:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=1:02:23):**  looking forward to releasing in the future.  There anywhere before, anywhere besides workingcows.net and the links you've already mentioned that  you want to promote or any other resource or product you want to talk about real quick?  
**[1:02:37-1:02:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=1:02:37):**  No, I don't think so.  I think we've done a pretty good job of promoting other...  The school that shall not be named again?  
**[1:02:46-1:02:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=1:02:46):**  Right.  Yeah, it's like Lord Voldemort.  Don't give his name power.  
**[1:02:52-1:03:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=1:02:52):**  Just kidding.  Glad to tell him that when we're talking in a couple of days.  No, it was a great experience though.  
**[1:03:00-1:03:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=1:03:00):**  Even having the High Plains Ranch practicum in three years of this podcast as a background,  plenty of new ideas, new thoughts, plenty of aha moments.  My one aha moment that probably was the most mind blowing is probably obvious to everybody  
**[1:03:15-1:03:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=1:03:15):**  else, but when we have water that's running off of our place because our water holding  capacity isn't up to snuff, it's not just that we missed out on that water, it's also  taking soil with it and so we're missing out.  
**[1:03:28-1:03:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=1:03:28):**  Exactly.  You can see it.  You can see it going off.  
**[1:03:31-1:03:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=1:03:31):**  Yeah.  Sorry.  It's kind of a... we're missing... we're also losing soil at the same time.  
**[1:03:38-1:03:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=1:03:38):**  It's not just wind that blows soil.  Yeah.  What I think of here is wind erosion, but water erosion.  
**[1:03:44-1:03:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=1:03:44):**  Right.  It's that even that most nutrient dense top layer of soil is taken away.  When you get up to the area where a four or five inch rain that comes in an hour barely  
**[1:03:56-1:04:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=1:03:56):**  makes the creek rise, it makes you feel pretty good about that.  Everybody else is cussing water gaps and...  Yeah.  
**[1:04:05-1:04:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=1:04:05):**  Yeah.  I don't know what to say.  I'm not there yet on my place, but I look forward to getting there.  
**[1:04:10-1:04:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=1:04:10):**  Awesome.  I'm looking forward to following along with your progress and watching you develop as  a manager and watching you move the needle in the biology in your place.  
**[1:04:19-1:04:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=1:04:19):**  And guys, it has been so much fun.  Like I said, CK and I, we've already done five other episodes.  We're going to release this as episode zero.  
**[1:04:33-1:04:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=1:04:33):**  And next week we'll be back rolling in with episode one with Hobbes Marguerite.  So CK, with that my dear, could you take us out?  Yep.  
**[1:04:42-1:04:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/00-Clay-Conry-Podcasting-101-eqenhd#t=1:04:42):**  Clay Connery at Working Cows Podcast.  Thank you so much for this amazing inaugural Ranching the Reboot episode.  We look forward to having you again.

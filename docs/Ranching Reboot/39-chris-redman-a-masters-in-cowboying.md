I met our guest through the Executive Link program and he's here to give us some tasty  
**[0:01:05-0:01:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:01:05):**  tips on how to grow the ultimate management team.

**[0:01:18-0:01:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:01:18):**  So hi Chris, how are you?  Good, how are you?  I'm doing really good.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:01:22):**  Haven't seen you in a while.  So I guess let's start off.  Chris, you probably don't know CK.  
**[0:01:30-0:01:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:01:30):**  I do not.  Hi.  Where are you located out of?  
**[0:01:35-0:01:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:01:35):**  So I'm northeast of Gordon, Nebraska.  Okay.  Is that?  
**[0:01:40-0:01:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:01:40):**  So that'd be east of Chagrin, west of Valentine.  Okay, I know where that's at.  About halfway in between.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:01:49):**  It doesn't get much more sand hills than where you're at, does it?  Yes.  We part, just the very northern end of the ranch starts getting out of the sand hills  
**[0:01:58-0:02:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:01:58):**  into South Dakota.  But yeah, pretty much the rest of the ranch is all sand hills.  The beautiful country.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:02:07):**  I was so surprised the first time I ever visited the sand hills, like this is in Nebraska?  Gorgeous.  Yeah, I get that a lot.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:02:15):**  A lot of people are expecting pivots and cornfields and flat and cornhuskers, right?  Yeah.  I'm not into that.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:02:24):**  I'm almost afraid to admit I've never really spent much time in Nebraska, even traveling  through it until about the last two years when our executive link meetings have been  displaced to South Dakota.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:02:36):**  And yeah, the sand hills, I can see why everybody likes it and everybody wants to go there.  That's a man, that's an awful pretty place.  So tell us what your ranch is like and what your situation is like there.  
**[0:02:49-0:03:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:02:49):**  Yeah, so the ranch is about 80,000 acres.  And we are a bison cow-calf and yearling production operation.  We have about 1600 animals in our breeding herd.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:03:06):**  And we have about 1500 animals in a yearling herd.  And so we, you know, basically our operations are to grow cows and then put those into yearlings  and put those yearlings into meat.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:03:25):**  Perfect.  We'll get into like some more specifics about grazing.  And you know, I kind of want to know what a year is like in the life of a bison rancher.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:03:37):**  So it's the McGinley Ranch, correct?  Correct.  And it's one of 15 ranches that Ted Turner owns.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:03:46):**  Oh, really?  Yep.  Nice.  
**[0:03:50-0:04:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:03:50):**  And so Ted owns, there was six, still kind of is, but they combined two ranches to one  this year.  So there's five ranches in Nebraska, two in South Dakota, one in Kansas, three in New  
**[0:04:06-0:04:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:04:06):**  Mexico and three in Montana.  And all those ranches total up to just under 2 million acres of private land.  Yeah.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:04:17):**  Yeah.  That's what I know.  That's what's exciting.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:04:20):**  That's exciting.  That's a lot of work.  And then all the bison total up to just about 45,000 bison total.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:04:27):**  Yeah.  Wow.  I can imagine that scale.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:04:31):**  Yeah.  It's big.  The one in Kansas is only about 10 miles straight south of me.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:04:37):**  And the managers, I know them really well, they're fantastic people.  And yeah, I'll stick with cows.  So let's go to you, Chris.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:04:48):**  Let's talk about your story.  Where'd you come from and how'd you get where you're at?  And what was the journey like?  
**[0:04:56-0:05:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:04:56):**  Yeah.  So it is a long story and I've had quite a journey.  I grew up in Eastern Washington state in the Palouse, which is kind of like the Sandhills  
**[0:05:07-0:05:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:05:07):**  only all farm ground and really good soil.  I grew up there.  I grew up with a love of agriculture.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:05:16):**  And when I graduated high school, I joined the air force.  I spent four years as a F-16 jet mechanic and I got to travel the world and see lots  of things.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:05:29):**  During that time, being a country boy, I had gotten kind of tired of living in dorm rooms  on base.  And so I went to looking for a different situation and I was able to find a rancher that would  
**[0:05:46-0:05:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:05:46):**  take me in.  And so I worked for him during the day, lived in his sheep camp, a little sheep wagon.  And then I worked swing shift for the air force at night.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:05:59):**  Okay.  Sheep wagon.  Those are like teardrop trailers, right?  
**[0:06:06-0:06:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:06:06):**  They're like very small, aren't they?  They are.  Yes.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:06:09):**  Like what's the square footage?  Do you know?  Like maybe a hundred, I don't know.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:06:13):**  They're pretty small.  It's just basically a bed and a stove, a wood stove that you cook on and a few drawers and  that's about it.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:06:25):**  No air conditioning.  Yeah.  Open the window.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:06:28):**  Opening the door.  Yeah.  Kind of roughing it a little bit.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:06:35):**  Yeah.  And it was great.  The guy, it was in Morgan, Utah.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:06:40):**  The guy was super cool, taught me a bunch and I just fell in love with ranching at that  point.  And so I finished my service in the air force and then I went to get a bachelor's degree  
**[0:06:57-0:07:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:06:57):**  with the GI bill.  And so I ended up with a bachelor's degree from the University of Idaho in range and  livestock management.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:07:05):**  That was 2004.  And so I got done with that and I went and cowboyed for about a year on the Matador ranch  in Montana, near Dillon, Montana.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:07:18):**  Pretty big outfit.  And then from there, I just kind of wanted to try to do my own thing for a while.  And so I went back and worked for the air force as a civilian and that didn't last for  
**[0:07:38-0:07:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:07:38):**  a long time.  I was not born to be in that kind of situation.  And so I ended up, me and my family moved to Ruby Valley, Nevada.  
**[0:07:50-0:08:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:07:50):**  And I told my wife at that point, I want to earn a master's degree in cowboying.  And so that's what I set out to do.  And so for the next, what was it?  
**[0:08:02-0:08:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:08:02):**  So that would have been, oh, eight to about 12.  I just worked on big ranches, cow camps, all sorts of different fun stuff, and really learned  how to be a good cowboy.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:08:20):**  And I loved it.  Family loved it.  It was good.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:08:23):**  And then my boss, I was working at Tree Top Ranches in Eastern Oregon, and my boss talked  me into applying for the King Ranch Institute for Ranch Management.  And so I ended up getting accepted into there in 2012 and moved my family in July from Eastern  
**[0:08:43-0:08:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:08:43):**  Oregon to South Texas.  And so-  Despite the change, right?  
**[0:08:51-0:08:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:08:51):**  Kingsville's a lovely place.  I wasn't sure I was going to die.  Did you melt?  
**[0:08:55-0:09:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:08:55):**  I feel like anytime I'm in Texas, I melt.  Yeah.  So I would add a bonus to that is we really wanted to stay out of debt and the school  
**[0:09:05-0:09:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:09:05):**  is paid for, but not a lot of living expenses.  And so we decided to purchase a used fifth wheel trailer.  And we lived in a fifth wheel trailer down there for two years with our family of three.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:09:21):**  And then we added a fourth one while we were down there.  So three kids that is.  So yeah, anyway, it was pretty interesting time.  
**[0:09:33-0:09:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:09:33):**  The Institute was a great learning experience for me.  It was a great program and I still, I mean, the skills that I learned there were invaluable  and I still continue to build on those skills every day.  
**[0:09:50-0:10:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:09:50):**  So I graduated there in 2014, spent about six months as assistant manager at Roaring  Springs Ranch in Eastern Oregon, and then got a position as a ranch manager with Turner's  on McMurtry Ranch in October, 2014.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:10:11):**  And so I did that for three years.  And then we found out my youngest son at the time had autism and we lived about 50 miles  from the nearest town and there was not a lot of resources for him there.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:10:30):**  And so we were able to move into a different role in the company, recruiting and training.  So I got to learn how to do HR work.  And so I was quite a change from ranch manager to HR, but it was really good experience.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:10:47):**  And I learned a bunch and was able to help the company in a lot of ways by having that  previous experience.  And then we just had to get back to the ranch about a year ago.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:10:58):**  We moved up here to the McGinley Ranch.  So I've been here about, I guess, a year and a half now.  So where's the McMurtry?  
**[0:11:07-0:11:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:11:07):**  Where's the McMurtry Ranch?  It would be south of Menzel.  So it would be about 70 miles south east of where I'm at.  
**[0:11:20-0:11:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:11:20):**  So it's closer to Valentine and then south.  And at the time it was the most remote ranch in Nebraska.  Must be a, I don't know if that would be a curse or a blessing.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:11:35):**  Sometimes it's kind of nice to be all the way at the end of the road.  You just knew that anywhere you went you were going to be in the car at least an hour and  a half one way, no matter what.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:11:48):**  Well, you know, sometimes 20 or 30 minutes is bad enough.  But an hour and a half, yeah, that'd be a little bit rough.  You'd have to make sure all the women got their shopping mall trips in and you got your  
**[0:11:59-0:12:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:11:59):**  Starbucks and McDonald's while you were there.  Yeah, yeah, for sure.  So that was an hour and a half just to Valentine, which there's a McDonald's that's about all  
**[0:12:11-0:12:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:12:11):**  this there.  I remember going through it.  It didn't seem like there was a whole lot.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:12:19):**  So I'm really interested in talking about people management and what are you looking  for in a new hire for, I think you guys probably call it technician, like an entry level technician,  but some of the rest of us might call it a herdsman now.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:12:40):**  And how do you build and maintain good teams?  And those are great questions and something that I have spent a lot of time on.  And I'm just going to preface with all this that we live in a lot different world than  
**[0:12:58-0:13:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:12:58):**  we did even 20 years ago.  20 years ago, if you wanted a ranch and you put out an ad in Western Livestock Journal  and you had probably 30 people that were calling it.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:13:11):**  And it's just not that way anymore.  And very, very few people out there have ranch experience.  And so when I talk about recruiting candidates for a job in our company, it has changed from  
**[0:13:26-0:13:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:13:26):**  looking for somebody with a ranch skill set to almost a complete 180 and hiring for character  and training for skill.  And that's a really hard thing to do.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:13:40):**  You know, a lot of people don't either have the time or want to take the time to train  people to do ranch work.  And so getting that mindset of hiring for character is tough.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:13:58):**  But really when you look at it, there is so much value in having somebody with the character  that you need and just taking the time to train them for skill.  And actually if you have the person with the right character, the training time is very  
**[0:14:14-0:14:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:14:14):**  minimal because they're going to go out and learn most of it on their own.  So you know, that really, you know, looking for that person is difficult.  I spent a lot of time in our company telling our story and building our brand so that people  
**[0:14:31-0:14:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:14:31):**  knew who we are and we're excited about the work that we're doing.  And I think that's really the first thing that you have to do is you have to have a  story to tell and something that excites people to come work for you.  
**[0:14:49-0:15:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:14:49):**  Whatever it is, and everybody's got their unique piece that they can showcase and highlight.  And so, you know, really looking at yourself, your operation and what is that unique piece.  And then you start advertising different places.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:15:06):**  You know, I spent a lot of time getting to know different people at university level,  which is great.  And it helps get, you know, internships and sometimes you can get a recent graduate from  
**[0:15:20-0:15:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:15:20):**  that.  But I think the real good candidates have come from places like Ranch for Profit, the  Stockman Grass Farmer, the National Bison Association, different places like that to  
**[0:15:37-0:15:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:15:37):**  really get the ad out there.  And then the biggest key to all that is a great interview process.  And that is something that we have worked at for the last three years extensively to  
**[0:15:52-0:16:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:15:52):**  try to get a really good interview process that captures as much as you can from a candidate.  And I think that the most important piece that is often overlooked in an interview process  is the reference interview.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:16:09):**  So calling and interviewing references.  And the key to that is you picking the references for the candidate.  A lot of times they're going to hand you a list of here's my references and they're already  
**[0:16:29-0:16:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:16:29):**  cherry picked by them.  So if you can go into their job experience and ask for different references, I think  sometimes that really pulls out some things.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:16:41):**  What are some questions that you ask?  The references?  The questions?  
**[0:16:49-0:17:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:16:49):**  So I asked what context they worked with employee and then I asked them to rate that employee's  performance on a scale of one to ten.  Or if it's a coworker, whatever.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:17:05):**  To rate that performance of them in that job on a scale of one to ten.  And I asked them what were their strengths during that job and what was their biggest  area of improvement back then.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:17:22):**  And I think when you say back then it really takes the pressure off of them not wanting  to make the employee look bad.  Oh, yeah, they're different now.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:17:34):**  Like they've improved it.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:17:37):**  Yep.  So those are the questions and then anything else that they'd like to share.  But it's really super simple, but it's highly effective.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:17:47):**  I think that it's important that you got to kind of mine those references and really drill  down and maybe find the one, one of the ones they don't necessarily want you to talk to  and see what they have to say.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:17:59):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I'll say this, this isn't a flag by any means, but it can be like a checkered flag,  
**[0:18:08-0:18:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:18:08):**  if you will, if you get this.  If you get a candidate that gives you their current boss for reference, I think that's  huge and I will ask them.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:18:19):**  Yeah.  Most of the time they say no because they're looking, you know, they don't want them to  know they're looking.  
**[0:18:26-0:18:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:18:26):**  Yep.  Right.  And I don't hold that against a person by any means.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:18:31):**  Right.  They let their boss know and they're transparent with their boss and their boss knows they're  looking.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:18:37):**  I think that that's really cool and I think that's a huge, huge bonus to that person.  Yeah.  I wouldn't even think of that, but that is so true.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:18:47):**  Well, it tells you one thing right up front that, you know, there's, there's already,  they have an existing good relationship and there's good communication and they're parting  on good terms.  
**[0:18:56-0:19:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:18:56):**  Yeah.  So those, those are already some pretty strong pluses.  I want to pause for a minute here and you know, before we get, you know, kind of in  
**[0:19:03-0:19:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:19:03):**  the middle of this interview process, there's resumes being floating around and man, it's,  it's, it's, what are some tips for reading through the bullshit and, and seeing what's  really there in a resume?  
**[0:19:21-0:19:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:19:21):**  Do you hate when you see grammar errors?  Yeah, I do.  I really do and I hate resumes.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:19:28):**  Um, in fact, so I, uh, I got to know a guy out of Montana this year, um, that he was  posting a job on LinkedIn and it just, the, the job description really spoke to me, you  know, I just like, wow, this, this is really cool.  
**[0:19:46-0:20:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:19:46):**  It was a very disruptive type of job posting, but, but what he, he asked for, and I actually  did this in my last, um, hiring process for a person on this ranch is I, he said, I don't  want to resume.  
**[0:20:03-0:20:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:20:03):**  You can send a resume, but I'm not going to read it.  Um, what I want is a compelling cover letter that gives me your life mission, vision, and  values, and a SWOT analysis as pertaining to this job or this role.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:20:19):**  And I asked for that and instead of getting like 30 or 40 resumes that were junk or people  that really didn't care that they're just mass sending them out, I got, I think like  six applicants.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:20:33):**  And out of those six, I had three that actually did the, the cover letter.  The other three, I was nice and I emailed them back and I asked them to reread the instructions  and provide me with the required or requested content.  
**[0:20:50-0:21:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:20:50):**  And I never heard back from those three, but, but I had three excellent candidates that  were super hard to choose between.  I imagine that made it pretty simple.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:21:01):**  You, you weeded out a lot of the tire kickers and drivebys and the guys that weren't gonna,  weren't gonna answer the phone when you called them back anyway.  Yes.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:21:10):**  And the ones who had their mom write their resume.  Or, or, or a college friend or something.  Right.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:21:19):**  Yeah.  So, and I think it's really difficult to read resumes because people are not very honest  in resumes a lot of times, but you know, if you're going to look through a resume, I think  
**[0:21:33-0:21:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:21:33):**  just really a lot of people are looking for how quickly did someone move jobs and all  that.  But to me, that really doesn't matter because everybody knows that sometimes it's really  
**[0:21:45-0:21:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:21:45):**  hard to find a good fit.  You know, it's hard for a manager to find a good employee and vice versa.  And so I don't necessarily hold job changes against a person.  
**[0:21:56-0:22:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:21:56):**  But what I do look for is what is this person accomplished?  Not duties and responsibilities, but you know, what are the compelling things that this person  has done?  
**[0:22:06-0:22:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:22:06):**  And so, you know, you can look at education a little bit.  I could care less about GPA.  Just, you know, what did they do and did they finish?  
**[0:22:17-0:22:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:22:17):**  And what are they, what have they been doing with their life since they graduated?  I think that's another key piece.  You know, are they, you know, increasing responsibility?  
**[0:22:29-0:22:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:22:29):**  I think that's a really good thing to look at with a resume.  How about any tips for writing one or what if somebody is listening to this podcast that's  wanting to come and look at, you know, say Turner for a job, what are some tips for writing  
**[0:22:47-0:22:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:22:47):**  a resume?  You know, I think one of the best things that I ever did is go through a resume building  company.  
**[0:22:56-0:23:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:22:56):**  I know that kind of goes back to like having your mom write it, but actually it's a great  investment.  I think it cost me a hundred dollars at the time.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:23:05):**  They kind of do counseling though.  It's like almost like a consultation.  It really is like this is how you're structuring up to sell yourself.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:23:13):**  Yeah, absolutely.  And so I think a good, um, good resume building company and plus like they have some really  good templates out there that can make your resume look nice.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:23:25):**  I'm still, maybe I'm old fashioned, I'm still not a fan of pictures on a resume.  That's just me.  And I, and I've actually read some articles, you know, corporate type articles and most  
**[0:23:37-0:23:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:23:37):**  people say that if they see a picture on a resume, they're going to put it in the trash.  So I've stayed away from that for sure.  I think, so the way that I set mine up that I really like is at the very top, there's  
**[0:23:52-0:24:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:23:52):**  three short columns that kind of highlight that I have a summary statement that's, you  know, I don't know, three or four sentences long.  And then I have my education and I have, um, training attended right up front.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:24:09):**  And I think those are important keys to just try to highlight those things because it shows,  you know, what, where your background is.  It tells you who you are as a person.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:24:21):**  And I think so some people write a, like, this is what I want to do with my life, but  I think that a person should have coached it differently.  And this is who I am and this is what I bring to the table.  
**[0:24:37-0:24:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:24:37):**  Because maybe you say you want to be a ranch technician, but maybe not.  Maybe you just would love to have a ranch job to learn something and that's okay too.  But I think just telling what you bring to the table and about your character is a huge  
**[0:24:54-0:25:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:24:54):**  deal in that front piece.  And it like super quick, um, you know, you can get into more detail on your cover letter  for sure, but it just something to grab someone's eye and say, Oh, okay.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:25:06):**  This is what this person is going to offer me right up front.  And then the training that you've done, I think is huge because it shows you that shows  the employer that, Hey, this person is working on continuing education and they want to improve  
**[0:25:22-0:25:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:25:22):**  their craft.  You know, they're really trying to be the best they can be.  Okay.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:25:29):**  So you're advertising for a position and I sent you what you need and now we've made  it past the interview process and you're down to, you know, down to three.  So how are you trying, how are you choosing between applicants to try to, to try to guess  
**[0:25:47-0:26:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:25:47):**  what this round peg is for your round hole?  So I'm going to add one more piece in the interview process.  We have started doing a panel interviews where we have three to four ranch managers that  
**[0:26:01-0:26:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:26:01):**  are on the phone at the same time for the interview.  And I have found that extremely helpful.  Sometimes it's really hard for people to do that because they don't want someone else's  
**[0:26:13-0:26:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:26:13):**  opinion, but I think getting peers opinions on a candidate is a huge deal.  And then this may sound bad, but it induces stress to the candidate.  You know, all of a sudden there's four or five people on the phone and it can be a little  
**[0:26:34-0:26:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:26:34):**  bit stressful knowing that you have to respond to those people that way.  But that's the job too though, right?  It is.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:26:43):**  No, absolutely.  Absolutely.  Um, and so, I mean, I think it's a, I think it's a good thing and it's fun to see how  
**[0:26:51-0:27:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:26:51):**  people react.  And then, you know, we also ask a lot of character based and their behavioral type interview  questions.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:27:00):**  So we're asking them to describe a time where they did something really well and a time  where they messed it up.  And one of the big things that you can pick out is when people are unwilling to say, well,  
**[0:27:13-0:27:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:27:13):**  I can't think of a time where I did this poorly or whatever.  That's a huge red flag.  And so, you know, I really pay attention to that and look out for that.  
**[0:27:25-0:27:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:27:25):**  But we asked that, so we'd come up with, you know, core competencies for that position.  And then we asked those questions, super simple questions around those core competencies.  So for an example, um, let's say a stock would ship, you know, tell us, um, you know, your  
**[0:27:42-0:27:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:27:42):**  experience, um, in good stockmanship and tell us about a time where you used good stockmanship  in it.  Um, it worked really well.  
**[0:27:51-0:28:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:27:51):**  And then they explain that and then, um, and then we asked them, okay, tell us about a  big wreck that you had, um, when you weren't using good stockmanship and, and you know,  what'd you learn from it?  
**[0:28:04-0:28:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:28:04):**  So those are really good questions that help pull out character out of skills too.  Those are like almost some questions we ask on the podcast.  I'm like trying to think how I would answer those.  
**[0:28:16-0:28:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:28:16):**  What was your biggest wreck?  Yeah.  And it's good because it shows humility and it shows, you know, that someone's able to  
**[0:28:27-0:28:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:28:27):**  learn from a mistake and, you know, we all are going to make mistakes and, and if we're  not making mistakes, we're not trying hard enough.  And so, you know, just being able to learn from those mistakes and hopefully not make  
**[0:28:43-0:28:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:28:43):**  those same mistakes again is really what we're after from learning from people.  So yes, um, that, those are a couple of things that I just wanted to say before, uh, I dove  into that.  
**[0:28:56-0:29:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:28:56):**  So, so I have, you know, usually three to four other ranch managers that are helping  me to decide which, you know, how to narrow those candidates down.  Um, but when I get down to the last three, um, so, you know, we're rating those candidates  
**[0:29:14-0:29:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:29:14):**  on every step.  We do a, um, an initial phone screen, then we do the interview.  Um, and, and then, you know, at that point we're going to rate those.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:29:26):**  And so the highest rated person will invite out for an onsite interview.  And I think that especially in ranching, uh, but in a lot of other sectors of onsite interview  is absolutely critical.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:29:41):**  And a lot of people don't want to pay for the travel, but, um, you know, we paid for  all the travel and I think I'll never forget.  This has been some time ago, but I, I went to interview at tree top ranches and I was,  
**[0:29:57-0:30:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:29:57):**  you know, pretty broke cowboy had a family living in Cal camps.  And I drove out there to interview, um, with this person and all he did was filled my tank  up with diesel, but, and they had, they had some kind of a family needed deal and they  
**[0:30:14-0:30:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:30:14):**  had some leftover food.  They fed us, you know, but I just felt like, man, this person is going to take care of,  um, his employees.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:30:23):**  And he did, you know, but it was just as simple as filling me up with diesel.  Um, and, and that was a huge deal for me that I didn't have to pay for that.  So I think it goes a long ways when you are willing to pay for that travel, um, for that  
**[0:30:38-0:30:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:30:38):**  person to come out there.  So, and so, you know, during that interview process, there's a, um, that onsite, I'm going  to introduce some of the rest of the team.  
**[0:30:49-0:31:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:30:49):**  I'm going to let them spend some alone time with other team members because I want their  input as well.  And, um, and so my goal is to get at least two of those people out for onsites, the top  
**[0:31:01-0:31:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:31:01):**  two.  And, uh, um, you know, there's a chance one of them may back out.  And so you've got that third one.  
**[0:31:09-0:31:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:31:09):**  Um, hopefully that, you know, can be a backup plan, but, um, you know, you're really after  that top candidate and, you know, the, the important thing I think to remember is, you  know, what am I trying to hire?  
**[0:31:25-0:31:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:31:25):**  And, you know, for, for us, we're really looking for a players.  We want people that are driven that want to go somewhere that are passionate about what  we're doing, that can fall in line with our mission.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:31:36):**  And so we've got to be able to, you know, draw those people out.  And, uh, and so we have someone out for a onsite interview, we're really looking for  those characteristics, um, and that they're going to mesh well with the team.  
**[0:31:49-0:32:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:31:49):**  And I trust my team to point, pick out things that I might miss.  You got any good, uh, onsite interview, crash landing stories?  Yes, I do.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:32:03):**  And, and I had to check myself on this because like it really took me back.  I thought, wow, Bob, I'm probably overreacting here, but, um, I had someone come out.  It was a little bit more of an informal, um, interview.  
**[0:32:19-0:32:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:32:19):**  Uh, the, the person was just coming out.  They're fairly local, came out to kind of take a look.  Um, but you know, we really hadn't gone through the whole interview process yet, but, uh,  
**[0:32:30-0:32:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:32:30):**  they came out and, um, you know, I shown them around and they're riding with me and we must  have gone through 10 gates and they never once got out to open a gate.  And, and so I'm thinking, well, you know, maybe I'm missing something, you know, so  
**[0:32:49-0:33:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:32:49):**  I asked a couple of my peers, like, would this bother you?  Like, yeah, no, don't hire that person, you know, but you should have seen Ryan and I's  faces because we did ugly cringe face because we're like, yes, that's awful.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:33:06):**  That's rule number one.  If you're sitting on the right side, yes.  Hit the damn gate.  
**[0:33:15-0:33:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:33:15):**  So anyway, that was a, that was a pretty, uh, pretty polite mod.  Um, but then again, you know, like somebody raised in the city, that's never been around  farming and ranching.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:33:27):**  I've had those moments where I didn't, when I saw the gate and how you're supposed to  close it with like the shield cheater bars and stuff, I just don't want to embarrass  myself.  
**[0:33:36-0:33:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:33:36):**  But if it's like a latch, well, these are swing gates.  Yeah.  So it's not those wooden ones that you have to like lay on the ground and do the cheater  
**[0:33:46-0:33:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:33:46):**  bar to get the wire to go.  Yeah.  Pretty easy.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:33:50):**  I bet.  I mean, regardless, this person was, um, a manager on a ranch.  Okay.  
**[0:33:56-0:34:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:33:56):**  They should have been handy enough to know how to close an open gate.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[0:34:01-0:34:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:34:01):**  You'd think anyway, but that was probably the biggest one.  That case is just like guys probably just being lazy.  He's like, it's not my ranch, I don't get out and open a gate.  
**[0:34:12-0:34:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:34:12):**  I don't work here yet.  I'm not opening that gate.  He must not have wanted the job that bad.  
**[0:34:18-0:34:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:34:18):**  No, I don't think so.  So I guess after, you know, after the onsite interview, they're probably either hired or  not.  
**[0:34:30-0:34:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:34:30):**  Um, so what would, uh, what would a typical first year look like for a new hire?  Like from an HR standpoint, like what are you looking for from a new hire for the first  year?  
**[0:34:42-0:34:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:34:42):**  So, um, this is something that we spent a lot of time on as well in our company building  and, and I think a good onboarding program is critical.  You know, there's a lot of statistics out there that say, if you don't do a good job  
**[0:34:59-0:35:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:34:59):**  onboarding an employee, that they're probably going to be checked out in the first nine  to eight days and you're lucky to keep her six months.  Um, and so, you know, we've spent a lot of time trying to figure that out and I don't  
**[0:35:14-0:35:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:35:14):**  know that we have it great yet, but we do have a good system to where, you know, we  get that person in on day one, you know, we sit them down with a job description.  We really try to minimize the paperwork.  
**[0:35:26-0:35:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:35:26):**  You know, when there is, there are things that we have to do, but we've gotten to where  most of that's electronic and people can actually do it ahead of time if they want to.  And so that makes it handy and pretty simple.  
**[0:35:39-0:35:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:35:39):**  And then, and then take them for a tour out on the ranch.  Um, just, you know, really make that first day enjoyable.  And then the other thing that we've done on the first day is done our ATV safety training.  
**[0:35:52-0:36:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:35:52):**  So we have kind of a protocol that we do there and just get that done and out of the way,  you know, I give them their, their pickup.  It's all nice and clean that, you know, I've made sure is in really good shape.  
**[0:36:02-0:36:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:36:02):**  Um, they, you know, if they have a computer or workstation that that's clean and everything's,  you know, squared away for that workstation, you know, prior to that, making sure if you  do provide a house that that's really clean and ready to go.  
**[0:36:17-0:36:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:36:17):**  You know, one of the things that we haven't done yet that I would like to get to the point  where we do is have kind of like a welcome package for them when they arrive into the  house.  
**[0:36:27-0:36:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:36:27):**  Maybe they've got, you know, a warm batch of cookies, you know, maybe it's some swag  from the ranch, um, you know, just something like that, a nice warm welcome, glad you're  here, um, package in their house.  
**[0:36:39-0:36:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:36:39):**  Um, you know, and then making sure that everything's, you know, really squared away at the house.  And then, you know, the, you know, other parts of that, um, you know, at first, you know,  then take your first week, okay, you know, what should this first week look like?  
**[0:36:54-0:37:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:36:54):**  You know, want to give them some training and then give them a chance to, you know,  give them some jobs that they, that are really super simple, but they can go and get to know  the ranch with, you know, um, get them into different pastures and that kind of stuff.  
**[0:37:07-0:37:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:37:07):**  Um, but we, we created what we call it the bison worker training program, um, which we're  actually renaming the ranch technician training program.  Um, but, uh, it basically is designed to take a person from day one and, and take them into,  
**[0:37:27-0:37:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:37:27):**  um, their, through their first year is really getting their skillset built up, um, to where,  you know, we sign them off on all these different tasks to where we feel like they're an actual  contributing member to the team that, you know, they are a seasoned ranch hand at that  
**[0:37:45-0:37:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:37:45):**  point, if you will.  That they've seen hopefully about everything and they've learned how to do everything.  And so, you know, a year in they're, they're a functioning employee and they're adding  
**[0:37:55-0:38:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:37:55):**  value to the team.  Um, that's really our goal.  And so we, we line that out and it can get done a lot quicker than a year, but we give  
**[0:38:04-0:38:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:38:04):**  it a year just in case, just depends what time of year they start so that they can go  through the whole cycle and calendar events.  Um, and, uh, so that, um, that's one of the pieces.  
**[0:38:19-0:38:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:38:19):**  And then we take, um, another approach from there.  If a person wants to develop into, um, a ranch manager one day, that there's a pathway for  them to do that.  
**[0:38:31-0:38:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:38:31):**  And it's divided into like four different, um, certifications, if you will, that kind  of progresses that person from their skill set all the way on up to supervisory and,  um, uh, and different types of roles, getting them ready to be budgetary, financial, ready  
**[0:38:49-0:38:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:38:49):**  to be a manager.  Would you rather hire a manager or grow one and promote from within?  We would rather grow one and promote from within.  
**[0:38:59-0:39:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:38:59):**  Um, but we have not done a good job at that.  Um, you know, this is pretty recent, you know, building this program and it's, you know,  I mean, it's a succession plan and when you have people that work for your company, they  
**[0:39:12-0:39:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:39:12):**  want to grow.  I mean, not everybody does.  Some people just want to stay as a ranch hand and that's great, but the people that want  
**[0:39:18-0:39:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:39:18):**  to grow that are excited about the company and believe in our mission and what a, what  a great asset that would be to be able to promote that person and to be a manager later.  I always think it's better to try to grow your own than to try to, you know, cause what  
**[0:39:36-0:39:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:39:36):**  you're looking for, the person you're looking for to run your ranch or, or to be a herdsman  or to just go out and pick up poly wire.  That person ready-made does not exist.  
**[0:39:47-0:39:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:39:47):**  If they do, they've already got a job.  You have to grow your own in a lot of things.  Yeah.  
**[0:39:54-0:40:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:39:54):**  So we've, we've gotten really blessed to hire some great managers and and it's, and it's  worked.  But we, you know, we would really like to be able to grow our own and and develop them.  
**[0:40:10-0:40:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:40:10):**  And I mean, it gives someone something to look forward to and it and then it gives the  company, you know, an investment in that person.  So what, what is a year like on a bison ranch?  
**[0:40:27-0:40:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:40:27):**  So I'll start off, you know, in the beginning of the year, we're generally gonna work our,  our core herd, which is our breeding herd in late January to mid February sometime in  there.  
**[0:40:42-0:41:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:40:42):**  And so at that point we're pre checking our cows or calling anything that's open and we  are weaning our calves.  We like to do it, you know, some of the ranches do it in the fall, but we prefer to do it  
**[0:41:00-0:41:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:41:00):**  later in the spring because we, those calves are more mature and, and they just wean a  lot better late later in the spring.  And I mean, they're almost already weaned anyway, so it makes it really super easy and  
**[0:41:16-0:41:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:41:16):**  less stressful to, to wean them.  And so, you know, at that point, we, we basically are creating an extra herd.  We have our flex herd, which is our newly weaned calves, all of our cold cows, and any  
**[0:41:33-0:41:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:41:33):**  kind of cold bulls that we have.  On the McGinley ranch, we are running all two year old bulls, and we trade them out  every year.  
**[0:41:43-0:41:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:41:43):**  So all those bulls that we put in with the herd will pull out and then they'll get grass  finished over the summer.  And so that's been a really great program for us and we just barely into it.  
**[0:41:56-0:42:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:41:56):**  This is our second year at it, but we really like it so far.  So yeah, that that gets ended somewhere around, you know, the middle of February.  And it, you know, we're generally working around 300 animals a day is kind of the speed  
**[0:42:17-0:42:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:42:17):**  that we're doing things.  You know, we really try to work them well and, and use good stockmanship principles  and just do it right and do it well to make it as stress free as possible for those animals.  
**[0:42:32-0:42:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:42:32):**  So you know, for, for people that haven't been around bison, you know, there's a lot  of different things out there, but we really work hard at stockmanship.  We have Hibbard come out every year and work with our team on all of our ranches.  
**[0:42:49-0:43:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:42:49):**  And then, you know, we just really practice that with each other throughout the year.  And so we work all of our animals on foot in the corrals.  We'll bring them up, you know, bring up drafts from clear back on the backside, you know,  
**[0:43:06-0:43:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:43:06):**  to stage for working for the day.  We'll use ATVs or UTVs for that.  When we're bringing up animals into the working facility, we do that all on foot.  
**[0:43:18-0:43:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:43:18):**  And it works really, really well for us.  So yeah, so that lasts, you know, somewhere around 10 days by the time you get through  all the calves and cows and everything.  
**[0:43:33-0:43:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:43:33):**  And then once that's done, those bred cows go back out to pasture and then the other  herd kind of goes off and that gets, they'll get some cake through the winter.  And the only reason that happens is because, so bison have a unique characteristic in that  
**[0:43:55-0:44:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:43:55):**  their rumen goes through a catabolic state in the wintertime.  So they don't need extra feed resources to keep going.  But they don't really get that catabolic state until their second winter.  
**[0:44:10-0:44:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:44:10):**  What does that mean?  Is that like their metabolism is lowered?  Yes.  
**[0:44:15-0:44:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:44:15):**  They don't?  Yeah, they're able to, the turnover rate in the rumen slows way down.  Metabolism goes up.  
**[0:44:23-0:44:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:44:23):**  It's kind of like hibernation, if you will.  Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's a good way to say that, yeah.  
**[0:44:28-0:44:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:44:28):**  Yeah, so they do that.  And we are super passionate about making sure that we don't feed that out of them.  I think that cattle used to be a lot more like that and we fed it out of them over the  
**[0:44:39-0:44:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:44:39):**  years.  But anyway, it's a really cool thing that keep bison, we try to let bison feed bison  as much as possible and we want them to thrive in their natural environment.  
**[0:44:52-0:45:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:44:52):**  So we really push for that.  So our bread cows, the only cake they get throughout the year is when we're getting  ready to work them, we'll get them used to the cake truck just to make it easier to get  
**[0:45:03-0:45:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:45:03):**  them into the system.  So those bread cows get turned out, our flex herd gets cake for a couple months and every  other day for a couple months and then we get green grass start coming in.  
**[0:45:22-0:45:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:45:22):**  We're generally getting those flex herd animals on our meadows pretty early, doing some flash  grazing on our wet meadows.  And then we get to around the first part of May and we start splitting that flex herd  
**[0:45:37-0:45:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:45:37):**  up because we're going to have to start shipping animals soon.  So our cold cows will go in a group, our bulls that we pulled off will go into different  grass finish groups so they don't breed anything.  
**[0:45:49-0:46:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:45:49):**  And then we have our yearling herd that continues to graze.  What we did this year, so in the past, and it's worked well, we have grazed those animals,  those flex herd animals solely on the meadows all summer long, high intensity, short duration,  
**[0:46:09-0:46:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:46:09):**  once or twice a day moves from May until August.  And that's worked pretty well.  But I decided to change some things up last year.  
**[0:46:20-0:46:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:46:20):**  And so we started balancing those animals for, we do like a couple weeks on the meadows,  high intensity, short duration grazing, and then we put them in small pastures in the  uplands for a week or two.  
**[0:46:34-0:46:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:46:34):**  And the reason that we did that is because of a lot of Fred Parenz's work and just knowing  phytochemicals and nutrient densities and those types of things, we wanted those animals  to have more variety.  
**[0:46:48-0:47:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:46:48):**  A lot of our wet meadows are high, have high amounts of Reeds Caray grass, which isn't  that nutritious.  And you know, there are some other plants in there, of course, but there is a lot of  
**[0:47:02-0:47:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:47:02):**  that.  So we wanted to get more variety in their diet.  And so we started doing some different grazing techniques there.  
**[0:47:11-0:47:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:47:11):**  So yeah, those yearlings will graze throughout the summer on those meadows and uplands, actually  all the way until October or November.  And then generally speaking, in November, we will work those yearlings again, and the  
**[0:47:28-0:47:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:47:28):**  bulls will get put on feed.  So they'll start getting backgrounded with oats and corn.  And then they'll go to one of our feed facilities, usually another ranch in Nebraska.  
**[0:47:47-0:48:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:47:47):**  So on that note, that's kind of another interesting thing that we do is our feeding program, we  used to send a lot of animals to commercial feedlots.  And we were losing a lot of animals to death loss.  
**[0:48:04-0:48:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:48:04):**  And so we looked at doing things differently.  And our vice president, he had spent some time doing some feed trials with bison.  And so we started playing with it a little bit.  
**[0:48:17-0:48:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:48:17):**  And then we dove into it.  But what we do to feed our bison is they're on a free choice ration.  So there's bales of alfalfa, bales of meadow hay, and there's free choice corn in bottomless  
**[0:48:31-0:48:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:48:31):**  bunks.  So they can go eat a little corn, they can go eat some alfalfa and grass.  And they self-regulate the rumor.  
**[0:48:39-0:48:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:48:39):**  And we give them more pen space.  So on average, they're getting about 600 square feet per animal of pen space.  And so they're more open, and they get to eat what makes them healthy.  
**[0:48:55-0:49:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:48:55):**  And because each diet is individual, and they do really, really well.  We went from, and I won't put any numbers out there, but we drastically reduced our  death loss to less than a half a percent.  
**[0:49:09-0:49:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:49:09):**  And is that different?  Because feedlots that I've been exposed to, they want to be aggressive at the bunk, right?  They want to clean up the bunk.  
**[0:49:21-0:49:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:49:21):**  So that's the difference, right?  In making it for the herd health.  Yes.  
**[0:49:29-0:49:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:49:29):**  And the other thing is, you know, in a typical feedlot, they get a TMR, and it's just over  power, right?  Yeah.  
**[0:49:38-0:49:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:49:38):**  How many of us like to eat TMR?  It's the same boring ration, right?  It's the really step up one.  
**[0:49:43-0:49:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:49:43):**  Maybe I want a little bit more honey today, you know?  I like green M&Ms, but every once in a while, I want a red one.  Yeah, right.  
**[0:49:51-0:50:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:49:51):**  And so it just gives them the opportunity to select their diet, and that helps each  individual grow better and stay healthier.  That's so interesting.  
**[0:50:03-0:50:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:50:03):**  I had no idea.  So yeah, so anyway, they'll go through that feeding process.  We actually, e-tranch retains ownership on those animals until they get slaughtered.  
**[0:50:13-0:50:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:50:13):**  All of our grain finished animals go to brush meat processors and get marketed through Rocky  Mountain Natural Meats as great range bison.  So if you ever go in the store and see great range bison, we supply about 40% of that product.  
**[0:50:31-0:50:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:50:31):**  We supply 40% of the animals that make that product.  And then, yeah, so the main herd has had their, they have their calves somewhere starting  about mid-April until about mid-July, but the bulk of them are mid-May to mid-June,  
**[0:50:52-0:51:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:50:52):**  you know, about a 30-day calving window.  And then, you know, the rest of them, there's some of them that are in that 60 days or so,  but most of them are in a 30-day window.  
**[0:51:05-0:51:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:51:05):**  And you can leave bulls in year-round and they'll just rut and you don't have to  worry about, you know, animals getting bred at odd times.  I was going to ask if you left your bulls out all year or if you did seasonal breeding  
**[0:51:20-0:51:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:51:20):**  and how you managed to get a tight breeding window or calving window with that, but it  sounds like bison are a lot better than bovine at regulating seasonal fertility to match  available forage quality.  
**[0:51:35-0:51:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:51:35):**  Correct.  Yeah.  You know, I mean, again, I think that that could have some, I mean, bison are wild animals  
**[0:51:43-0:51:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:51:43):**  for one, but I think that could have some relationship to feed.  Genetics too.  Yeah, genetics.  
**[0:51:51-0:52:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:51:51):**  But like, you know, part of that catabolic state, you know, those animals are on a declining  plane of nutrition.  So I think there's just a lot of value into nature's system regulating those animals.  
**[0:52:06-0:52:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:52:06):**  And then they, you know, I think evolution definitely plays a role in what beef cattle  have done over the last century or two.  And I would almost bet that over time that people that are feeding their bison through  
**[0:52:24-0:52:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:52:24):**  the winter and, you know, giving them high nutrition through the winter, I would almost  bet that they'll see reproductive changes in those animals.  Yeah, that's interesting.  
**[0:52:39-0:52:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:52:39):**  That's interesting.  Just a Chris Remen philosophy there, but.  Yeah.  
**[0:52:44-0:52:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:52:44):**  Can you, can you train docility into bison or is that, is that a myth?  Like they're always going to be wild is what I've heard.  You can to a point, but they are wild animals.  
**[0:52:59-0:53:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:52:59):**  And you know, the thing about them is they have horns and they know how to use them and  they might just be playing.  Like they get kind of frisky and they could just play with you and rip your guts wide  
**[0:53:13-0:53:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:53:13):**  open.  Right.  When you said we work them on foot, I was like, okay, I'm not, I'm not interviewing  
**[0:53:19-0:53:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:53:19):**  for this job.  Well, you know, you, you definitely gotta be able to read animals and they're, you gotta  jump on the fence.  
**[0:53:29-0:53:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:53:29):**  You know, I mean, I just was wondering if that was a myth.  Yeah.  I mean, we, you can with good stockmanship and building trust, you can get those animals  
**[0:53:40-0:53:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:53:40):**  to where they are a lot more quiet and calm, but they are still bison.  I work horned cattle on foot, but you know, that's horned cattle.  We're not talking about mostly wild bison.  
**[0:53:52-0:54:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:53:52):**  Right.  And I've even thought about, you know, the thoughts occurred to me more than once.  I dummy, maybe like wearing some body armor wouldn't be a horrible idea because there  
**[0:54:03-0:54:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:54:03):**  are some of these girls that have like three foot of spear on each side of their head.  Yeah, that wouldn't just hurt.  That would hurt a lot until the ambulance got there.  
**[0:54:13-0:54:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:54:13):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, the, I mean, we do, our, our, our pens are a little bit taller and a little  
**[0:54:20-0:54:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:54:20):**  bit wider just to give those animals a little bit more room.  But you know, if things go south up by the chute, you can guarantee that you did a bad  job handling those animals way back early in the morning.  
**[0:54:33-0:54:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:54:33):**  It all starts first thing in the morning and then it, you know, it can build or, you know,  you can deescalate it just depending on how you're working with those animals.  Well, it's kind of like that with cattle too.  
**[0:54:46-0:55:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:54:46):**  You know, if you have a rough morning gathering out of the pasture and you've got 16 cowboys  out there whooping and hollering and nine dogs and a cake wagon and everybody's making  noise and you, you have a rough sort and the cattle are getting agitated and you're getting  
**[0:55:00-0:55:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:55:00):**  in the middle of the day and it's hot and your helpers are tired.  You know, yeah.  By the time you start even running one animal through the chute, you know, that cumulative  
**[0:55:08-0:55:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:55:08):**  stress of poor stockmanship and poor handling is built up, not just in your crew, but in  the, in the animals.  I'm the kind of guy that, you know, I like to tell the trucks to be there an hour after  
**[0:55:20-0:55:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:55:20):**  I plan to already have everything in the corrals settled and quiet.  Even on work days, I try to get everything, you know, into, into at least a 20 acre trap  the night before.  
**[0:55:32-0:55:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:55:32):**  So it's a nice quick gather in and everything goes quiet and smooth.  And we don't start charging those animals with a lot of stress.  And I imagine it's easier to do with bison is they probably respond a lot differently  
**[0:55:47-0:55:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:55:47):**  than cattle.  So do you want to talk a little bit about some of the stockmanship differences between  bison and cattle?  
**[0:55:53-0:56:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:55:53):**  Yeah.  So, I mean, there are a lot of similarities between bison and cattle when, when thinking  about stockmanship.  
**[0:56:00-0:56:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:56:00):**  The biggest difference is their flight zone.  They are so, so sensitive and you just have, I mean, I am not good at, I'm just going to  say that out front.  
**[0:56:14-0:56:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:56:14):**  I am not a great stockman with bison.  I've learned a lot and I've gotten a lot better.  The guy that has been here on the ranch for 10 years, he loves stockmanship and he has  
**[0:56:27-0:56:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:56:27):**  made it his life's mission to be a good stockman.  He is great about, you know, with the animals and he's done a great job teaching me.  But that, you know, being patient, being slow and giving them plenty of room to make a decision,  
**[0:56:48-0:57:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:56:48):**  I think, you know, those are the big differences and it's not really that different.  It's just, you have to be a lot more sensitive.  And when things do go south with bison, they really go south.  
**[0:57:02-0:57:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:57:02):**  They're a little handier than a cow.  They can, they can move a little bit quicker and turn a little quicker.  Yes.  
**[0:57:08-0:57:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:57:08):**  Yeah.  And they, they have a lot of endurance and if you get one taken off, I mean, more, more  times than not, it's just better to let them go and, and just, they'll stop when they feel  
**[0:57:21-0:57:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:57:21):**  like it.  Yeah.  I mean, you can, you can get them to turn, but anyway, it's, it can be pretty dicey trying  
**[0:57:32-0:57:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:57:32):**  to do that.  So can we talk a little bit about how do we set up a team for success, like on a big work  day, like when you guys are working bison or shipping bison and you've got, you know,  
**[0:57:45-0:57:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:57:45):**  some new people on the crew, how do you set that up for success?  Yeah.  I think that's, that's a great, great question because I mean, it's always going to be a  
**[0:57:56-0:58:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:57:56):**  need, you know, I think one of the biggest things that a person can do is take the pressure  off yourself and off that person and don't expect anything out of that person.  You know, really try to make it a learning environment for them.  
**[0:58:12-0:58:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:58:12):**  So have an extra person there to help.  So you're not short-handed and you're not expecting that person to really come out there  and contribute a lot, but they can kind of make the rounds and shadow people through  
**[0:58:26-0:58:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:58:26):**  the day and get to know different places and what people are doing and how it all flows.  And I think that's probably the, the biggest key for success.  And maybe it's do that for, you know, the whole week, you know, or whatever to, so they  
**[0:58:43-0:58:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:58:43):**  can really get a feel for, you know, what needs to be done and how you do business instead  of them, you know, being in the wrong place and getting their butt chewed and you know,  feeling inadequate and feeling lost.  
**[0:58:56-0:59:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:58:56):**  You know, you take that pressure off and they're just there to learn.  And we, we always start our, every, and it's a little bit of a requirement, but it's not  a bad thing.  
**[0:59:09-0:59:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:59:09):**  But we start every day of works with a safety briefing.  And that's usually, I don't do that myself.  I assign that to another employee to do that.  
**[0:59:21-0:59:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:59:21):**  I think that's important as well for them to be able to express, you know, what they're  seeing and, and then they bring up a different point, you know, like maybe one day it's animal  stress.  
**[0:59:31-0:59:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:59:31):**  You know, the signs of animals being stressed, maybe another day is complacency on the crew,  you know, getting tired or, or complacent.  Anyway, they bring up different safety topics and then we talk about any near misses from  
**[0:59:45-0:59:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:59:45):**  the previous day, if there were any, anything we can do to mitigate that.  And I think that's just good conversation and, and it kind of loosens things up a little  bit.  
**[0:59:57-1:00:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=0:59:57):**  It gets people thinking about, you know, being safe.  And then the other thing that we do is we start off the day with prayer.  And I think that's a huge deal too.  
**[1:00:07-1:00:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:00:07):**  And, you know, I don't definitely don't force that on anybody.  It's I put it out front, hey, you know, we've decided as a crew as a team that this is what  we want to do.  
**[1:00:17-1:00:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:00:17):**  We want to say a prayer before we work animals.  If you're not comfortable with that, you'll feel free to step outside.  And so I leave that extremely open to, you know, whoever wants to join you with that.  
**[1:00:31-1:00:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:00:31):**  I was listening to you tell that story and I was just sitting here thinking, tell me  your former Air Force without telling me your former Air Force when you said that you had  a safety brief every morning, but you delegated that task to somebody else.  
**[1:00:45-1:00:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:00:45):**  Yeah.  You know, I love the concept of a safety brief.  Personally, you know, I picked that up when I was in the Navy, you know, every morning  
**[1:00:53-1:00:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:00:53):**  starts with a brief.  This is what we're doing.  This is what everybody's doing.  
**[1:00:56-1:01:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:00:56):**  This is where we're going.  I've tried to carry that culture forward in the things that I do in the ranch and in  the community.  
**[1:01:04-1:01:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:01:04):**  Like, you know, a lot of, we do a lot of prescribed burning down here and I've tried to bring  that in with prescribed burning.  And, you know, we've started doing it and we're working cattle, you know, and for just  
**[1:01:12-1:01:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:01:12):**  branded calves, get everything in, get all the guys like, okay, this is what we're doing.  You guys on these gates, you're on horses, you guys go make sure the beer is still cold.  We'll get it done.  
**[1:01:24-1:01:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:01:24):**  Okay.  So we're a little, we're not big corporate, you know.  Guys around here drink beer at 10 o'clock in the morning working cows.  
**[1:01:31-1:01:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:01:31):**  I'm not one of them.  But you know, just having that safety brief and everybody being on the same page.  Don't assume that because we've done this for the last 10 years every spring, that everybody  
**[1:01:45-1:01:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:01:45):**  magically knows what everybody's going to be doing.  Even if it's just taking a minute or two to line out roles, just to start with.  So that's what I want to add is I've been to a ton of brandings where we're free labor,  
**[1:01:59-1:02:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:01:59):**  right?  Or weenings or just like, they just know that we're always there for the beer too.  And so what I've seen the most successful is those people who line them out and say,  
**[1:02:07-1:02:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:02:07):**  this is what I need.  This is the goal of today.  We set the agenda.  
**[1:02:12-1:02:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:02:12):**  I'm sorry, I sound like a total tech sales person.  We set like the tone for the day, what needs to be done.  And then I've had people who just start doing things and then want everyone else to read  
**[1:02:24-1:02:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:02:24):**  their mind.  And I'm like, that's why you had to wreck the day.  And I think the other thing that I do that has really set our team up for success is  
**[1:02:35-1:02:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:02:35):**  so each person, at least currently the way that we operate, each person has animal stewardship.  So one person's in charge of our breeding herd, the other one's in charge of our flex  herd and then another one's in charge of our finishing herd and kind of all maul animals.  
**[1:02:53-1:03:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:02:53):**  So whenever we work or ship animals, the person that's in charge of that herd is coordinating  that event.  They're putting people where they need to be, they're making assignments and generally  
**[1:03:06-1:03:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:03:06):**  we're all going to be the same places.  It's not like it changes much, but if anybody new is there or anybody helping them, they'll  make those assignments and they're the boss.  
**[1:03:17-1:03:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:03:17):**  And so I'm just there to help.  That's my job there to help.  And so I think that also sets things up for success as well.  
**[1:03:27-1:03:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:03:27):**  You're kind of there to just enable them and make sure that they have the tools for success  so they can accomplish their job.  Yeah.  
**[1:03:36-1:03:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:03:36):**  And if things aren't going right, I need to be able to step back and see the bigger  picture and what's going on.  And so I've got to be able to be that leader there that's doing that.  
**[1:03:49-1:04:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:03:49):**  But my job isn't to manage the people.  My job is to develop my team into being leaders themselves.  Train your own replacement, right?  
**[1:04:04-1:04:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:04:04):**  Right.  Absolutely.  It's a master delegation actually.  
**[1:04:07-1:04:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:04:07):**  Like if you're the head honcho, that's your job is you're a master delegator.  So every CEO's role.  I love what Jocko Wilmick says.  
**[1:04:17-1:04:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:04:17):**  He says, if you want to be in charge of everything, be in charge of nothing.  Jocko's a wise man.  Maybe one of these days we'll get big enough we can attract a name to be on here like Jocko  
**[1:04:35-1:04:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:04:35):**  to talk to us about real leadership from the trenches.  I want to hear some more about your bison.  Sorry about how you regeneratively manage and graze the bison.  
**[1:04:49-1:05:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:04:49):**  We kind of skipped through a lot of that when you're going through your year in the life  of a bison ranch manager.  But you did talk about doing some flash grazing and then doing some daily moves, moving twice  
**[1:05:00-1:05:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:05:00):**  a day, spending time in the meadows and then going up to the highlands.  So how are you doing that?  We all know.  
**[1:05:07-1:05:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:05:07):**  Everybody knows and it's accepted as fact that bison won't stay in behind polywire.  Yeah, that is a myth.  And we do use a lot of polywire.  
**[1:05:18-1:05:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:05:18):**  And I'm not going to say that it's always perfect.  And I'm sure that there's been plenty of people that are listening to this podcast that have  had lots of polywire wrecks with cattle as well.  
**[1:05:31-1:05:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:05:31):**  Or sheep.  Or sheep.  Yeah, for sure.  
**[1:05:34-1:05:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:05:34):**  And so, you know, we, there's a lot of speculation about what can be done with bison and whatnot.  And we're still figuring a lot of that out.  I think there, you know, we started going down a road where we thought maybe we could  
**[1:05:57-1:06:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:05:57):**  get cattle as tight or bison as tight as cattle.  But bison aren't meant to be that tight.  And they do need some more room.  
**[1:06:06-1:06:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:06:06):**  But we've gotten fairly good results having bison at, you know, 40 to 70,000 pounds per  acre, which is pretty good.  And behind, and that's behind a single strand polywire.  
**[1:06:19-1:06:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:06:19):**  And that was, you know, 12 hour move, 24 hour move.  You know, we're probably somewhere averaging somewhere around 30,000 pounds per acre.  We're on the meadows.  
**[1:06:32-1:06:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:06:32):**  Let's stop for a second.  And let's like,  Yeah.  
**[1:06:35-1:06:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:06:35):**  What does 30 to 70,000 pounds an acre stock density of bison look like?  Like how many acres, how many animals and how often were you moving them?  Because I know the math and it's easy for me to understand that, but not everybody gets  
**[1:06:49-1:07:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:06:49):**  that.  So 50,000 pounds per acre would be like 1200 yearling bison, which are weighing probably  somewhere around the 700 pound range on seven and a half acres.  
**[1:07:03-1:07:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:07:03):**  So that,  Hey, not a lot of cattle producers even do that though.  Let's be real.  
**[1:07:10-1:07:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:07:10):**  Sorry, you guys, we're not doing that yet, but I'm just saying.  And so those animals were actually on about three acres, three to three and a half acres  on their own.  
**[1:07:21-1:07:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:07:21):**  They, you know, they had just grouped up to that for most of that grazing period of 12  hours.  But generally speaking, you know, like our, what we're really shooting for on a day to  
**[1:07:31-1:07:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:07:31):**  day basis, that's what we've done.  What we found really works probably the best for the animals.  It's not quite as, you know, we would like to be a little bit tighter than we are, but  
**[1:07:42-1:07:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:07:42):**  we're about 30 acres with 1500 animals.  And you know, those are yearling animals.  So you know, it, it's quite a bit less than 50,000 pounds per acre, but those are, you  
**[1:07:55-1:08:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:07:55):**  know, one to two day moves.  And really that's, that ends up being pretty good.  The animals are really comfortable with that.  
**[1:08:04-1:08:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:08:04):**  And yeah, you can tighten them up to 20.  And that seems to work okay.  You get much under 20 acres and they just don't, they're not as comfortable and they're  
**[1:08:14-1:08:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:08:14):**  not doing as well.  And you know, yeah, you have some breakouts, but for the most part, I mean, those animals  stay in really, really well.  
**[1:08:23-1:08:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:08:23):**  We're doing our bulls.  That's a different story.  They're a little more pushy and a little less content usually.  
**[1:08:32-1:08:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:08:32):**  And so even if they have a lot of room, they like to push on the fences.  And so we found that we actually have the best results with at least a two wire poly  fence for them.  
**[1:08:44-1:09:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:08:44):**  But my employee this year that I just hired, he's been doing a lot of work with these bulls  and our bull herd is pretty small right now.  I've got about three, let's see, 200 head left and he's been getting them down to like  
**[1:09:00-1:09:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:09:00):**  an acre and a half to two acres.  And they've been doing really well on that.  That's pretty impressive.  
**[1:09:10-1:09:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:09:10):**  That's impressive stuff.  What kind of changes have you seen in the land since you've done that?  And like, what are your rest periods like?  
**[1:09:17-1:09:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:09:17):**  I guess that's really the important one is, and maybe tell us how much rain you get too.  Yeah, so our general rain is about, I think our long term 12 year average is about 17  inches.  
**[1:09:32-1:09:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:09:32):**  And we have a lot of good cool season and warm season grasses up here.  So our rest periods on our meadows typically are going to be 60 to 90 days, averaging around  75.  
**[1:09:55-1:10:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:09:55):**  And they might even be longer, but where we've seen the most success is if we can like go  into a meadow that has a lot of reeds canary grass, and we can graze it down to carpet  in early May, early to mid May.  
**[1:10:10-1:10:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:10:10):**  When those cool seasons are getting to that boot stage, we can graze it down and then  let it rest for 14 months.  And you're seeing a lot of native grasses come in on their own.  
**[1:10:24-1:10:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:10:24):**  Some warm season grasses and perennials, I mean, they're all, it's been highly effective  to be able to do that.  You know, where in the past, we've maybe grazed a pasture three times in the season.  
**[1:10:37-1:10:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:10:37):**  And you know, you keep hitting that cool season, but then those warm seasons start coming up.  And so you know, that reeds canary grass, it's a product of, you know, of course, it  was introduced to get more tonnage, but that tonnage isn't necessarily high quality.  
**[1:10:54-1:11:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:10:54):**  And so, but they, people have hated and hated and hated over the years.  And you do the same thing year after year, you go in there and you cut that down right  when those warm season grasses are in the most critical stage.  
**[1:11:10-1:11:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:11:10):**  They're in that boot stage, and you're cutting that same pasture down and cutting those warm  season, the cool seasons are already mature.  They've done their thing, they're lignified, they're going dormant.  
**[1:11:25-1:11:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:11:25):**  And the warm seasons are most vulnerable.  And so, you know, paying that meadow the same time year after year is detrimental.  And so, you know, what our goal is, you know, at first we were trying to kill reeds canary  
**[1:11:42-1:11:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:11:42):**  grass.  And so as we've spent more time with Fallon Williams and Understanding Ag, we've understood  that our job is to create more life.  
**[1:11:52-1:12:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:11:52):**  And so instead of trying to kill reeds canary grass, we're trying to make opportunities  for more diversity.  And we've really seen that happening.  
**[1:12:02-1:12:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:12:02):**  And the soil health of these meadows that have been regeneratively grazed for a while  now, we're increasing in soil organic matter and soil carbon.  We actually had a study done on soil carbon differences between meadows that were grazed  
**[1:12:19-1:12:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:12:19):**  intensively and ones that weren't.  And there was a good bit of difference in the amount of carbon in the regenerative grazed  ones.  
**[1:12:29-1:12:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:12:29):**  Can you share those numbers like or even like a percent increase?  You know, I don't have that off the top of my head.  I apologize about that.  
**[1:12:36-1:12:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:12:36):**  I would share it if I had it.  I just don't.  Okay.  
**[1:12:40-1:12:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:12:40):**  Was it significant or?  Yeah, I mean, I think it was still, you know, single digits, but it was significant.  I mean, I think anything, you know, I mean, above even a three to 5% increase is huge  
**[1:12:53-1:13:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:12:53):**  with organic matter.  I don't know what the soil carbon difference was, but the organic matter was definitely  I think it was above 3% if my memory serves me right.  
**[1:13:06-1:13:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:13:06):**  There's always a correlation between soil organic matter and water holding capacity  and soil carbon, you know, and they all kind of track with each other, you know.  So I suppose you could, you know, it's a reasonable inference that, you know, if those  
**[1:13:19-1:13:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:13:19):**  other metrics are going up that your actual carbon storage is going up as well.  And it's going to be probably, it's going to be a few weeks before we release this.  We're going to put some carbon episodes in front of this one that we've just wrapped  
**[1:13:35-1:13:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:13:35):**  up doing.  So we're kind of like all wrapped up in soil carbon.  But also like reminders, you're in a pretty brittle environment, right?  
**[1:13:44-1:13:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:13:44):**  Yeah.  So and we're talking more on the meadows on that.  So the meadows aren't as brittle.  
**[1:13:52-1:14:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:13:52):**  They are pretty resilient.  Our uplands are really a challenge and we're still working on figuring that out.  But you know, the biggest challenge is actually the temp fencing in the uplands.  
**[1:14:03-1:14:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:14:03):**  It's really, really hard to keep those animals behind.  You know, that's the funny thing, right?  You know, we get on these meadows and we got them tight and think that, you know, with  
**[1:14:12-1:14:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:14:12):**  bison that would be the biggest problem.  Really good.  It's actually in the uplands where they don't stay behind those fences very well.  
**[1:14:20-1:14:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:14:20):**  So we're still trying to figure that out.  But really our goal right now is there's a spot between the meadow and the upland.  There's kind of a bench there that is a little more productive.  
**[1:14:32-1:14:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:14:32):**  And so we're trying to find places that we can get those animals on those benches that  have good drinking water.  And we can start working on some of those and trying to push out our biology, you know,  
**[1:14:45-1:14:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:14:45):**  further out.  And then any time that we can.  So we're doing a couple of things.  
**[1:14:51-1:15:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:14:51):**  One, we're trying, you know, we're still trying with the temp fence and the uplands where  we can try and get them down into smaller paddocks and get, you know, even if we can  get 10,000 pounds per acre, you know, on there, it's going to be better than it was.  
**[1:15:05-1:15:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:15:05):**  But the other thing that we're doing, especially with our main herd, is that we're using some  herding techniques and we're herding those animals into different places of the pasture,  you know, for a couple of days here, a couple of days here and a couple of days here in  
**[1:15:20-1:15:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:15:20):**  these big upland pastures.  And we're seeing some good results with that.  And so it's still too early to tell, you know, what that looks like.  
**[1:15:28-1:15:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:15:28):**  But you know, it's still a training period as well.  Those animals aren't used to doing that.  They're used to going to their favorite spots in that pasture and being there for 10 days,  
**[1:15:37-1:15:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:15:37):**  you know.  So, you know, you still have to keep bringing them back and bringing them back.  But you know, we have really gotten to where we're trying to move those animals every three  
**[1:15:46-1:15:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:15:46):**  days, three to five days, you know, and those uplands.  So you know, just keeping them for, you know, two, three days in different parts of that  pasture.  
**[1:15:56-1:16:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:15:56):**  And it means being out there with them more, but it also means you're not putting up a  temp fence, you know.  And you know, sometimes a temp fence is the right answer and sometimes herding them is  
**[1:16:07-1:16:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:16:07):**  the right answer.  It's just another tool in the toolbox.  So you're talking about herding bison.  
**[1:16:13-1:16:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:16:13):**  And you know, I'm good friends with Bob Kinford.  So I'm really curious to stay in touch with you, and I know we will, and see how this  herding experiment works out and what you guys learn from it stockmanship wise and how  
**[1:16:31-1:16:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:16:31):**  the bison respond.  Because you know, some of the things that I've heard from the Hoy's are just incredible.  And Justin and Ricky Kremers are, it's not anecdotal anymore.  
**[1:16:43-1:16:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:16:43):**  I mean, there's definitely something to, you know, trying to quote reboot the herd instinct  or reboot the natural grazing instinct of these animals.  There's definitely something to that.  
**[1:16:55-1:17:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:16:55):**  Yeah, the one thing that has been really effective for Dusty on my crew is doing his moves in  the evening.  You know, waiting until the evening, doing the moves and then settling those animals  
**[1:17:08-1:17:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:17:08):**  there in the evening has been a huge game changer for that.  You know, I mean, it takes the right person to be able to do that.  You know, you go back to, you know, hiring the right people and letting, you know, we  
**[1:17:21-1:17:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:17:21):**  talk about it a lot that ranching is a lifestyle, but I don't think most people understand what  that means.  And especially if a person's come from an eight to five job, they are, you know, it's  
**[1:17:33-1:17:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:17:33):**  harder for them to adapt to ranching as a lifestyle, but sometimes five or six o'clock  at night is when it's right for those animals.  And you have to be able to be on their clock and not on a certain schedule.  
**[1:17:49-1:18:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:17:49):**  So, you know, I think that's what, you know, and as a manager or a boss or an owner, you  have to be, you have to be trusting, you have to hire the right people that you can trust  that if you see them at their house at one or two o'clock in the afternoon, then you  
**[1:18:07-1:18:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:18:07):**  know that they're getting their job done and they're doing it right.  And that they are living that lifestyle, that they're working when they need to work and  they're getting the job done and they're putting in the necessary time.  
**[1:18:19-1:18:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:18:19):**  You might get up at five o'clock in the morning and go check pastures, then come back, take  a siesta, record a podcast, go fishing, and then go move bison in the evening.  Yeah.  
**[1:18:31-1:18:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:18:31):**  And it's really hard for a lot of bosses to be okay with that.  Absolutely.  Yes.  
**[1:18:37-1:18:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:18:37):**  It's an easy cultural change.  Like I see that too.  It's like, if you're going to expect them to do all these hours, give them the middle  
**[1:18:44-1:18:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:18:44):**  of the day when there's downtime off.  I agree with that.  And if, if, if, if, whenever possible, let them create their own schedule.  
**[1:18:53-1:18:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:18:53):**  Yes.  They'll get more done with their own schedule.  Right?  
**[1:18:57-1:19:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:18:57):**  Yeah.  That can be really cool for a family situation.  You know, maybe they take their kids to school and give their wife a break for a while.  
**[1:19:04-1:19:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:19:04):**  You know, I mean, just, you know, get, leave that open.  You know, there's always those times where you're working animals, where you all need  to be there at certain times.  
**[1:19:12-1:19:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:19:12):**  If you don't, then let them do their schedule.  That's pretty good advice.  So I kind of look at the clock here and we're running a little bit long.  
**[1:19:25-1:19:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:19:25):**  Have we left anything on the table that you want to get off your chest, Chris?  No, I think you asked some really good questions and we covered some really good things.  You know, I'll just say that with the regenerative, we're still pretty new.  
**[1:19:40-1:19:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:19:40):**  I mean, we've been doing regenerative agriculture for a long time, but you know, really working  hard at applying these principles of adaptive grazing.  You know, we're getting better at it and we're doing more of it now than we ever have, but  
**[1:19:54-1:20:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:19:54):**  we're still learning.  And so, you know, it's really fun to be able to learn, you know, more about the animals  in these situations and then see the responses of the land as well.  
**[1:20:10-1:20:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:20:10):**  So five years down the road, we'll probably have a lot cooler story to tell at that point.  I hope we're here to tell the stories.  Oh, we will be.  
**[1:20:24-1:20:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:20:24):**  One way or the other.  CK, do you have anything?  No, I just, I feel like I learned so much more about bison that I, I mean, I guess I  
**[1:20:33-1:20:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:20:33):**  didn't know anything.  So just, it was interesting to have this episode and cover this because I feel like I'm going  to go tell my husband all this stuff now.  
**[1:20:42-1:21:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:20:42):**  Well Chris, I really appreciate you being here and I'll add one last thing.  You know, I talked about our bison being bison and our philosophy and it's just, so, you  know, my journey, I talked about my journey pretty, pretty black and white, if you will,  
**[1:21:02-1:21:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:21:02):**  more of jobs and stuff.  My paradigm journey, I started out pretty hardcore buckaroo, you know, production ag,  you know, really strong background that way.  
**[1:21:16-1:21:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:21:16):**  And over the years, I've slowly changed my paradigm to be a lot more conservation oriented  and then coming into regenerative agriculture, which growing up in Eastern Washington state,  I mean, that is the furthest thing from what they're doing there.  
**[1:21:31-1:21:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:21:31):**  You know, I mean, it's all fertilizer spray, you know, all that stuff.  And you can see what it does to the land.  And so, you know, it's been a hard shift for me to shift that paradigm, but I have, and  
**[1:21:45-1:21:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:21:45):**  I really love the direction that we're at, but you know, from a livestock background,  you know, production livestock, you know, it's a huge piece of who I was and, you know,  I was pretty hardcore that way.  
**[1:21:59-1:22:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:21:59):**  And so, you know, I've gotten into a spot where, you know, we're a lot more hands off.  We're letting the animals be animals and actually take care of us instead of us taking care  of them.  
**[1:22:12-1:22:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:22:12):**  And so our bison philosophy is really one that we want those animals to go out and be  their best with what nature intended for them.  And so, you know, providing very minimal inputs to them and they go out and they have to get  
**[1:22:31-1:22:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:22:31):**  bred on what nature provides.  So mother nature is actually our coal factor.  If they come in open, they're not able to meet mother nature's needs, then they go down  
**[1:22:41-1:22:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:22:41):**  the road.  And so we also are able to do that with our reproductive efficiency by only keeping those  animals that are bred.  
**[1:22:49-1:23:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/39-Chris-Redman-A-Masters-in-Cowboying-e1a0u8h#t=1:22:49):**  And so it takes a lot more work up front.  It takes a lot more animals up front because mother nature is going to take quite a few  of those out by the time they have their second calf.

So August, we've been hanging  out all day. Came up, had a little breakfast, big ranch tour. You got to see  
**[0:01:39-0:01:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:01:39):**  some of southern Pratt County and some of Barber County. So how are you feeling  about it? Pretty good. This is neat country like I've never seen. It's cow  country and rough. It definitely has its own challenges. So tell our listeners  
**[0:01:55-0:02:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:01:55):**  where you're from. I'm from Owensville, Missouri about 60 miles east of St. Louis  right in the center part of the state. We're off of highway 50 where a cow-calf  backgrounders, finisher, operation. Okay so are you from there in Missouri? I am  
**[0:02:19-0:02:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:02:19):**  from St. Louis County, yes. And we currently, my wife and I live on my  parents farm which was started by my grandparents in the 70s. Okay so what  would I guess kind of walk me through your background since the farm has been a  
**[0:02:37-0:02:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:02:37):**  family for a little bit. You went off to college, got an education, worked in the  world. How did you decide you wanted to be a rancher? I always knew I wanted to  raise cattle. I thought back when I was a kid I thought it took 200 acres and 30  
**[0:02:54-0:03:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:02:54):**  beefalo cows. When I was in high school my parents moved to Wyoming for, I guess  for fun. While I was out in Wyoming I learned about big cow-calf operations  and realized that I loved that. What part of Wyoming were you in? We were in  
**[0:03:18-0:03:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:03:18):**  the northwest part so we lived in a little town called Wilson which was on  the outskirts of Jackson. I went to Jackson Hole High School. I was trying to  think if I've interviewed anybody from there but it's like I've covered every  
**[0:03:31-0:03:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:03:31):**  other part of Wyoming but that one. Yeah I was with Dallas Mount and he said not  really Wyoming and I had to chuckle. Fair enough. It's a big tourist spot. Fair enough.  I was just reading an article about Jackson Hole the other day about how it  
**[0:03:51-0:04:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:03:51):**  kind of blew up into a tourist area in the 70s and 80s and they were marketing  it as like the last of the cowboy culture and it was just just kind of  turned out to be over commercialized like everything else. Is that that kind  
**[0:04:02-0:04:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:04:02):**  of track? Yeah it's grown up quite a bit since I've been gone. I left to go  to Mizzou in 2012 and visited probably yearly than bi-yearly and every time  I'm out there you know it seems like there's more and more people and way  
**[0:04:24-0:04:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:04:24):**  more traffic and things have definitely changed from when I was there.  I guess that's the thing about you know some of those western landscapes and you  know and excuse me some of the areas that we've kind of discussed lately like  
**[0:04:41-0:05:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:04:41):**  on the podcast like Riverton and you know Wind River Mountains where  Katie's at up there, Cora, how recently that was actually settled and I think  I'm lucky. I think we're lucky here in the Red Hills that nobody knows about it.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:05:02):**  Yeah that's something that is that's neat but at the same time with growing a  farm market or a farm sales or direct marketing business that could also lead  to challenges because of the population or you know just trying to sell a value  
**[0:05:22-0:05:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:05:22):**  added product. Yeah I mean population density is definitely you know  population density equals access to market but the greater population  density gets in the area the more competition there is for things like  
**[0:05:36-0:05:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:05:36):**  land resources which drives the price up you know maybe there's a little more  competition in the labor market maybe that's actually driving your day help  price down which could be you know helpful I don't know what day help  
**[0:05:48-0:06:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:05:48):**  gotten really expensive in the last 12 months I can tell you that especially  around here. Yeah every place is gonna have its own little advantages and  disadvantages and you every place can probably have an unfair advantage if you  
**[0:06:03-0:06:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:06:03):**  know what you're looking for. Yeah a hundred percent and it's just trying to  figure out what those unfair advantages are which will give you a leg up.  Okay so growing up in Jackson Hole you went to Mizzou in 2012. Yep then let's see I  
**[0:06:21-0:06:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:06:21):**  graduated a semester early December 2015 we had had a bunch of heifers that we  were gonna calves about 75 heifers that we were supposed to calve that spring  did calve that spring and so I had to graduate early so I could do that spent  
**[0:06:46-0:07:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:06:46):**  you know late nights early mornings and multiple times throughout the day  checking on them you know way different than what I do now what as far as  calving heifers I couldn't even tell you how many heifers are gonna calve this  
**[0:07:02-0:07:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:07:02):**  fall. We'll get to that later look we could talk about some of those  differences later but yeah what's your degree in? Animal Science with a minor in  Ag Economics. Okay I really want to ask you what that taught you about how to  
**[0:07:22-0:07:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:07:22):**  manage forage at high stock densities or even how to properly graze a pasture?  It taught me a lot of things basically it was what I learned in school I don't on a  day-to-day basis implement if that makes sense I mean we aren't shooting for  
**[0:07:46-0:08:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:07:46):**  heavy weaning weights we aren't building rations we aren't well I don't there's a  lot of things that we're taught that we aren't aren't doing anymore. Okay. We could  we could cut that out maybe we'll leave it in. So I guess a missing link for me  
**[0:08:16-0:08:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:08:16):**  right now is your folks went up to up to Northwest Wyoming. Mm-hmm. How did you get  the place back in Missouri or did they never sell it? They never sell it so it  was my grandparents place. Okay. So my grandparents were both living while I  
**[0:08:32-0:08:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:08:32):**  was going through high school going through college and living on the farm as a couple  neighboring places came over open my dad had the opportunity to purchase those  places so one one was in 2012 and then the next chunk was in 2014 that is kind  
**[0:08:53-0:09:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:08:53):**  of the that's the total of our land base we run on now it's all touching and so  I guess back to my grandparents they were see I got married in 2016 and they  were both there so a couple years ago is when my grandma and grandpa both passed  
**[0:09:21-0:09:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:09:21):**  away and so that's when the farm went and my dad bought his brother and sister  out. Okay. And I think he bought it for maybe the investment you know we were  trying to run a farm sentimental value had a lot to do with it too and so I  
**[0:09:47-0:10:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:09:47):**  think he wanted it to keep keep it in the family I'm one of six boys and we  all love the farm so. Okay so I don't know how to ask it but I kind of want to  know like what succession planning lessons you may have learned through  
**[0:10:09-0:10:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:10:09):**  that experience? I think it's definitely we haven't talked a whole lot about it  I'm the oldest so my youngest brother is and I think he's gonna be in eighth  grade this year so we haven't talked about just a little bit of a split there  
**[0:10:26-0:10:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:10:26):**  yeah so we haven't really talked from like what's gonna happen next but I  think after this last go-around knowing what page everybody the other family  members are on would be very beneficial. I think making sure everybody's on the  
**[0:10:48-0:11:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:10:48):**  same page as far as what they want to see in the future for the land is  extremely important and that's you know that leads to who's actually going to be  doing the work and caring for it. Yeah and how it's gonna be laid out you know  
**[0:11:02-0:11:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:11:02):**  is it gonna be a split three ways a third third third or you know making  sure that it's just laid out so everybody knows or has an idea of what's  to happen. I think one of the biggest wrecks I've seen is is undivided  
**[0:11:21-0:11:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:11:21):**  interest is is a property being left to a number of heirs more than two in an  undivided interest type situation and then you know you know those heirs may  be up in their 50s or 60s by the time they get that quote undivided interest  
**[0:11:39-0:11:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:11:39):**  and how do you sell 26% of a ranch 26% of an undivided interest in something?  Yeah I know. I mean it can be really difficult you know and don't need to  solve the world's succession planning problems right here I mean I'm only 12  
**[0:11:58-0:12:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:11:58):**  minutes in there's no way we're gonna solve that problem right now but having  the conversation understanding that that's what's kind of helping your  family through right? Yeah I think just knowing where everybody's at talking  
**[0:12:12-0:12:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:12:12):**  about it way ahead of time before it really needs to be talked about or dealt  with because some of it you know has to deal with succession or somebody  something has to happen for the succession to take place and that's  
**[0:12:27-0:12:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:12:27):**  typically somebody has to die yeah that's typically death which that's not  a nobody likes talking about it nobody gets out of life alive we're all gonna  die I've never seen a hearse with a U-Haul behind it they only dig the hole  
**[0:12:47-0:13:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:12:47):**  big enough for the box you know have the conversation it's not gonna hurt  anybody it's not gonna take anything away from you it's not gonna take  anything off your plate if anything it's gonna make your life easier knowing that  
**[0:13:01-0:13:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:13:01):**  the people aren't gonna be fighting about your crap when you're not here  anymore yep 100% and that's I think that's the most important thing that  somebody could leave behind is leave behind their heirs not fighting about  
**[0:13:15-0:13:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:13:15):**  their crap yeah I'd say and I'd say a lot more families would stick together  and talk but I mean I don't know if wishes were horses I wouldn't have to  buy hay I'm not sure what that means so tell me about your cows tell me about  
**[0:13:32-0:14:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:13:32):**  your operation okay so when I graduated our cow herd is completely changed we  started with black cows registered bulls and a more input based system currently  we are buying cheap cows running what we think are value-added bulls and have  
**[0:14:00-0:14:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:14:00):**  decreased our inputs to basically one bale of hay in the winter and two bags  of mineral two bags of rock salt I guess I should say and then grass water  sunlight kind of sounds like my salt and scenery program yeah yep so what's your  
**[0:14:19-0:14:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:14:19):**  idea of a cheap cow oh I mean I've bought them as cheap as a hundred bucks  and they'll have 60 days 100 days later we try to buy cattle that it really  depends it depends a lot on on the cow itself and what her what she's carrying  
**[0:14:39-0:14:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:14:39):**  if she's carrying a calf that we out of a bull that we think it provides value  to our operation we give a little more for but we try to stick in four to seven  hundred dollar range on a on a younger running age cow but we also buy horns we  
**[0:14:59-0:15:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:14:59):**  buy color and that's two things the horn color ones can be pretty cheap yeah  that's two things that sale barns don't like or most people and that's because  of their market right you know with selling those calves and we're kind of  
**[0:15:17-0:15:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:15:17):**  working on building a market direct to consumer business as well as a beef  business to service other other people's farms and and meat programs so it's we  can anything that comes out really colorful or with horns you know it can  
**[0:15:43-0:16:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:15:43):**  it can roll into our meat business and you know the ground beef is really good  off of something with color yeah yeah without without like opening up a whole  can of worms about certified Angus beef and branding programs I think there's do  
**[0:16:02-0:16:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:16:02):**  you feel like we're working against consumer misinformation yeah I don't know  if it's I think some would be misinformation I would say a lot of it  is disconnection and maybe maybe miss maybe that's not the right word maybe  
**[0:16:23-0:16:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:16:23):**  it's just they don't know the whole story or they're not being told the  whole story yeah I mean and that would go in with you know just kind of maybe  holes in the information that they are are getting or definitely consumer  
**[0:16:44-0:17:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:16:44):**  education is one of our we I guess it's a necessary point something we do on  both ends whether we're selling a live calf to somebody's meat business or  we're going to sell a whole half quarter or a steak to somebody main education  
**[0:17:04-0:17:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:17:04):**  education education and why we're doing what we're doing I mean we spend a whole  I spend a lot of time talking about you know why we do the things we do and it's  you know time and time again we see people that just are so far removed from  
**[0:17:29-0:17:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:17:29):**  animal agriculture just agriculture in general that that you know education is  key and I guess with different branding programs and stuff like that I mean  they're taking the time to to talk to these people but I mean that takes money  
**[0:17:52-0:18:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:17:52):**  right do you think how do you feel about some of these branding programs have you  ever had somebody that like is a ground beef customer and has been buying your  stuff for six months come up to you and say hey is this certified Angus no I  
**[0:18:06-0:18:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:18:06):**  haven't you ever had anybody care what color rapper was on that ground beef no  or if they had horns they don't really care sometimes that's a another added  value is a good horn to Calico what do you get for him oh we get a couple  
**[0:18:23-0:18:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:18:23):**  hundred bucks for him how do you get them to the people that want them that's  my biggest problem I have people want offering absurd amounts of money the  problem is they're in California or in you know Minnesota or Chicago or  
**[0:18:38-0:18:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:18:38):**  something I'm like I can sell it to you for that but it's gonna cost that again  to put it in a box and send it to you yeah it's just it's just kind of word of  mouth I mean I mean we don't ship any beef products in the mail or through UPS  
**[0:18:55-0:19:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:18:55):**  or anything like that it's all home delivery delivered by myself sometimes  my wife helps and you know on real busy days or we'll go to different we'll go  different directions but it's easy for us to just throw a cow skull and if if  
**[0:19:16-0:19:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:19:16):**  they want we don't butcher a whole lot of horned cattle skulls or cattle right  now I'm still trying to work out the kink we recognize the value of having  horned cows in our breeding program but we aren't now you're getting them back  
**[0:19:36-0:19:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:19:36):**  from the from the slaughter plant right yeah I have somebody that on the side  I'll clean them up for us you just take them on a fence post for two years and  they get cleaned yeah that's a little slower return on the money than you're  
**[0:19:50-0:20:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:19:50):**  probably interested in yeah we don't yeah he European mount some bleaches and  cleans them off those horns back on nice nice mine minor like that so far been  restricted the ones that have expired in the pasture that have gone and found  
**[0:20:07-0:20:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:20:07):**  yeah yeah we got a couple of those and people are interested in those too and  you know that's kind of that's that's kind of something else that nobody talks  about about these you know cheap horned cattle that nobody else likes to buy at  
**[0:20:21-0:20:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:20:21):**  the sale barn yeah she might have cost me 300 bucks mm-hmm she had a calf in  her that she's gonna lean mm-hmm and I'm gonna have that calf and then when she  dies her horns are worth 300 bucks yeah yeah I will add though that like when we  
**[0:20:40-0:20:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:20:40):**  go to the barn or we buy these undervalued cows  horns are colored I mean most of those I'm all of them unless I know exactly  where they came from they don't end up in our meat program and that's because  
**[0:20:54-0:21:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:20:54):**  we run an antibiotic free program and I can't guarantee that they they don't  they've never had a shot or never licked it out of a mineral tub or ate it off a  bunk or something like that I feel that 100% so we got a we got a take you know  
**[0:21:13-0:21:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:21:13):**  when we buy them that has to be factored in our price because if we're not gonna  if we got to sell them for some reason if they're mean they're wild but you  know we have to buy them based off the resale value whether we get a calf out  
**[0:21:28-0:21:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:21:28):**  of them or not so most of the time we're buying these crossbred Korean e-cows and  a lot of them have South Pole in them and we're sourcing them just from a  couple guys that fit our program so if something comes up open or like that it  
**[0:21:46-0:22:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:21:46):**  can it can actually roll into our business South Poles with Coriantes  we've heard that before somewhere hopefully I'll get a see some in a couple  years yeah there we got our first set of I guess they'd be half and half they can  
**[0:22:06-0:22:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:22:06):**  have this spring the South Pole bulls and that's when we figured out there's a  big difference in in genetics as far as grass goes I mean without I mean the one  thing about EPDs are you know they do provide a consistency you know so you  
**[0:22:24-0:22:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:22:24):**  can look at them and they do kind of help true up a calf crop right so  because it's data and yeah it's data you can get you know you can kind of look at  it and and say well this bull should work right I mean there's gonna be  
**[0:22:43-0:23:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:22:43):**  outliers but having having the data the EPDs basically have helped people keep  stuff consistent I guess is what I'm trying to say I mean yeah I mean I'm not  saying I agree with it or I buy I don't buy paper or papered bulls or by because  
**[0:23:05-0:23:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:23:05):**  of EPDs but I can see EPDs being a valuable comparison tool within that  same group that's all measured under the same consistent things but taking EPDs  from you know from a breeder in California comparing them to a breeder  
**[0:23:22-0:23:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:23:22):**  in New York yeah that's that that might give you issues and I think that  regardless of what the EPDs say you know I prefer that a bull be sourced as close  to me as possible and on as similar of a program as possible yeah and so we buy  
**[0:23:42-0:24:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:23:42):**  bulls like that right but we do see problems in calf crop so inconsistency  in our calf crop because you know we can buy bulls that look that fit exactly  what they need to do but they may not have you know some sort of data or they  
**[0:24:03-0:24:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:24:03):**  could be just like man it was just a smoking calf this year but the cows had  dinks on top end or bottom and you know on before or after and she just happened  to have a great great calf we've run into some of that problem we're starting  
**[0:24:19-0:24:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:24:19):**  to look more into breeders and stuff like that I mean but it's just all part  of a learning curve and it could be on the cow side too sometimes I feel like  that learning curve approaches vertical like you know February 2021 we've got  
**[0:24:39-0:24:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:24:39):**  two weeks of negative below zero with snow and ice I feel like my learning  curve maybe was vertical during that week and then you know there's there's a  lot of times that I felt that way since that it's just man am I ever gonna get  
**[0:24:53-0:25:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:24:53):**  this there's this do you ever get that there's just days that you feel so dumb  you shouldn't even get out of bed yeah I would say that just learning I mean it's  so different than what everybody else is doing it's hard to you know go down to  
**[0:25:08-0:25:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:25:08):**  the road down to the neighbor and say hey you know I'm got you know this plant  growing here need this grazed or it's you're asking me is that lead plant yep  is that ironweed yep and I actually know what they are because I've seen it  
**[0:25:24-0:25:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:25:24):**  before yeah yeah and it's and it's just like okay what's this little plant you  know it's just this learning curve but a lot of it is you know no one else  around you to doing it so it's hard to you know it's like a small group of  
**[0:25:38-0:25:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:25:38):**  people were in so as we try to run more farm-raised bulls that fit our  environment as we try to cross breed cattle out of the norm for our area and  as we try to navigate those markets I mean those are all learning curves you  
**[0:25:55-0:26:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:25:55):**  know like buying a little roped out set of calves out of like st. Louis like I  went to st. Louis and I don't know how these got this guy kept these calves and  I got him home into our pins that we receive in and they were some of the  
**[0:26:12-0:26:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:26:12):**  wildest calves I've ever been around and I don't know how he kept them in in st.  Louis but you know it's just like learning curves like that and figuring  out like you know just with a little good stockmanship and some green grass  
**[0:26:27-0:26:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:26:27):**  and you can get those calves turned around and they'll probably make you a  pretty nice cow but I'll tell you one thing about roped out rodeo stock yeah  good grass good stockmanship can really settle them in yeah and you can do that  
**[0:26:44-0:26:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:26:44):**  for years you can have you could take that group of cows you can be with them  for years and they can be settled they can be happy with you just doing your  normal routine whether you're on foot side by side or if you're on a horse  
**[0:26:57-0:27:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:26:57):**  because they know you and they got used to you yeah you bring out one cowboy  that raises his voice or starts going a little bit too quick and all your roped  out stock 80% chance they're gonna fall back into their old behavior yeah yeah  
**[0:27:13-0:27:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:27:13):**  I could see that I've seen it I mean I've seen it happen I've watched that  happen with my cows yeah so like on stuff like that you know it just takes a  little bit of time and those animals I think cows remember everything that's  
**[0:27:29-0:27:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:27:29):**  happened to them yeah I would say the Korean he's do I don't know they just  seem I don't know if they specifically would remember people but I know that  they remember events yeah I mean we've had the same  
**[0:27:43-0:27:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:27:43):**  cows that were put together for a few years and they came on the truck  together you know they may have met each other on the truck you know had a  30-minute ride and they're always together you know these they get in  
**[0:27:55-0:28:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:27:55):**  these little groups and they got a memory I'd say they remember everything  that happened to them for the most part and I think every every time they get  roped or run out in the pen they know that they remember that and you know  
**[0:28:12-0:28:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:28:12):**  when they retire from that life and they either come to my ranch or they come to  your ranch because you know I've ended up I've got some of that stuff too you  know they can really they can integrate yeah but all it takes is is one hand  
**[0:28:28-0:28:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:28:28):**  just not paying attention or not being the stockman not having a stock sense of  knowing when too much is too much and just putting a little bit too much  pressure on animal and then they break back over into that mindset that you  
**[0:28:43-0:29:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:28:43):**  know that they were when you got them that they're afraid to see anybody even  walk out to the pasture you know we walk through mine today yeah there wasn't  about got attacked one of them tried to eat your pocket yeah I think it's like  
**[0:29:00-0:29:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:29:00):**  145 acres yeah yeah they've only been in there for like a week they're standing  right there and we could walk around them how many guys herds could we get  out around here and walk out into a hundred and forty five acre paddock and  
**[0:29:13-0:29:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:29:13):**  have the cows just lick off our pockets without a feed truck probably probably  not very many of them yeah I mean everybody the round or everybody that's  between my place and here that I know that could no I don't know anybody we  
**[0:29:28-0:29:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:29:28):**  could do that between here and there yeah without you know walking around  yeah what's that among them yep you can drive through a cow but I mean it's  something to have somebody in a string you know stranger show up and get out  
**[0:29:41-0:29:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:29:41):**  and walk through them that's what I mean that's one fun thing you know if people  come out to a farm tour and they get on them on a move you know I can put them  ten feet from the gate from a 16-foot gate and they can just get their video  
**[0:29:55-0:30:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:29:55):**  Tamra and you know 200 250 head will just walk by them as long as they don't  move yeah just don't move yeah one guy brought him out and about halfway  through he was videotaping and he ended up almost right in the middle of the  
**[0:30:11-0:30:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:30:11):**  gate opening and so they were just you know they were just going by him on both  sides and getting stressy and getting fast a little bit but for the most part  I mean it probably looked good on camera yeah good stockmanship does not look  
**[0:30:29-0:30:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:30:29):**  good on camera that's really boring to watch yeah but I probably my favorite  thing about running cattle I love the sorting and handling of it and feeding  you know moving poly wire and singing what they eat so it sounds like you're  
**[0:30:48-0:31:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:30:48):**  not doing like a typical Missouri grazing operation so I guess let's back  up tell me what's typical of your neighbors and what they do what kind of  their operations look like and then tell me how you're different well typical I  
**[0:31:04-0:31:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:31:04):**  guess would would be probably multiple paddocks with you know if they have 200  acres let's see my grandpa had 200 acres we'll use him as an example he had two  three four paddocks you know and then the hay field you know he'd bale the hay  
**[0:31:26-0:31:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:31:26):**  and then he'd graze them all and then we would feed hay in the  wintertime and that's probably what most people have they probably have some sort  of paddocks and they move some cows and you know they might have one reel just  
**[0:31:39-0:31:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:31:39):**  to have a reel and put it out there but for the most part they're gonna have  hay baled off their farm might some people might buy buy their hay or have  it custom baled but a lot of guys have the hay equipment and are bailing it you  
**[0:31:57-0:32:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:31:57):**  know four years ago I would have been caught dead with a roll of poly wire  really I would have told you it was useless yeah you're wasting your money  and now I wouldn't not have five of them laying around hey half a quarter mile of  
**[0:32:10-0:32:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:32:10):**  poly wire on a reel ready to go yeah oh yeah defense blowout let me go grab a  reel and I think more people in our area are do you have that because our farm  store has that we need to move from this pasture to this one across this one grab  
**[0:32:26-0:32:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:32:26):**  a reel make a lane yeah I mean it's it's I carry one with me pretty often like  there's even a couple water traps like we drove past today I have a couple  water traps where like my cable infrastructure has just become not  
**[0:32:44-0:32:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:32:44):**  workable and it's so much easier just to take a reel down there and I can do the  gate I mean it's faster and easier to build the gator build a watering trap  with a real faster to move it around and then when I'm done with it I could just  
**[0:32:59-0:33:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:32:59):**  pick it up put it back in the Gator and take it back to the shop yeah well what  how come you don't have a water trap how come you don't have any wire around your  water trap because I don't have any cows in here there's no reason to have it  
**[0:33:08-0:33:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:33:08):**  just makes it a little bit easier for me to drive through and get around the  place yep yep and so they kind of run you know just these paddocks and they'll  move them as they see the grass disappearing and then you know kind of  
**[0:33:22-0:33:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:33:22):**  have a plan like we cabin this field we hey this field we feed in this field  this is the field we winter in until it gets muddy and then we go to this where  we're gonna winter you know so just a lot of I'd say that would be kind of the  
**[0:33:38-0:33:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:33:38):**  norm around to us maybe some you know some strip grazing we're trying to to  teach and educate you know our neighbors and just by example I mean okay so what  are you calling strip grazing I would say where they just give the cow a day  
**[0:33:59-0:34:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:33:59):**  or a day to two to three days worth of feed at a time and then they roll up a  poly wire and have that that next that next chunk of feed so still so some  flavor so it's a flavor high density would you call it high density well to  
**[0:34:17-0:34:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:34:17):**  an extent I guess what's high density what would you call high density in your  country for reference I would say that high density here starts at about  twenty five thousand pounds an acre cattle yeah yeah and see like one day  
**[0:34:34-0:34:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:34:34):**  yeah so I mean we could get up to a million for for a couple hours for a day  I don't really I just know what it takes my herd to feed them I don't measure it  out so I would say like on our mix group of cows of that a day of feed would be  
**[0:34:57-0:35:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:34:57):**  probably two acres of grass and that's 220 head so 220 head when we'll just say  they average 800 because we'll have you know okay so for those at home following  along with their own calculator 220 times 8 times 0.3 that's a hundred and  
**[0:35:22-0:35:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:35:22):**  seventy six thousand pounds on the hoof and what is three percent oh so the  three percent is going to be consumption body weight consumption so that's we  need five thousand two hundred eighty pounds we need a mile of grass five  
**[0:35:41-0:36:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:35:41):**  thousand two hundred and eighty pounds of grass per day so if they're on two  acres per day you probably have a minimum of about twenty seven hundred  and fifty pounds of forage per acre that you're taking off we'll go with that  
**[0:36:02-0:36:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:36:02):**  okay so yeah two acres if you have if you have 220 800 pounders on two acres  for a day you're grazing about 2750 pounds of grass per acre that's what  they're taking out of there yeah that's like that's like a bale and a half for  
**[0:36:22-0:36:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:36:22):**  for you hay type people yeah a bale and a half a day easy round bale 1,600 pounds  round bale yeah well so our brown bales would be probably a thousand but oh you  guys have the midget bailers yeah or by five bail my hurdle eat eight bales a  
**[0:36:43-0:37:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:36:43):**  day eight thousand pounds of feed a day I think we were figuring yeah yeah  that's about right I mean that 220 yeah that's about right okay well that's good  I'm right on target I figure I figure one way 1,600 pound bales is 40 cow days  
**[0:37:00-0:37:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:37:00):**  yeah but like back to kind of figuring a strip oh I mean a lot of its I I use a  lot of my if I don't give them enough one day you know I give them a little  more than next if I give them too much then I you know it's just kind of  
**[0:37:15-0:37:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:37:15):**  constant adjustment and observation I mean that's the key to a lot of this is  is observation and because I get that question a lot how do you measure grass  how do you figure out how big your paddock can be yeah I mean you can use a  
**[0:37:29-0:37:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:37:29):**  grazing stick I don't I I just basically look at you know use my use my eye I  mean I don't get it right I mean there's some times it's overgrazed probably more  times than not but you feel less worse about overgrazing two acres yeah out of  
**[0:37:48-0:38:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:37:48):**  a 200 acre pasture then you would overgrazing a 20 acre pasture yeah I mean  it's a lot easier for me to make a mistake on a small scale like that when  you're moving on a strip grazing or you know ultra high-density daily moves  
**[0:38:02-0:38:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:38:02):**  whatever your term of the week is whatever but you'll move in every day  you're gonna make mistakes you're gonna mess up on your grass read you're gonna  have a bad day and it's a lot easier to recover from on the strip grazing on  
**[0:38:15-0:38:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:38:15):**  daily moves then with any with a kind of holistic adaptive plan grazing you know  like kind of like I guess that's what I'd call what I'm doing this year like  planned grazing system yeah and that's all about yeah like I said learning  
**[0:38:31-0:38:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:38:31):**  observation I mean when we started out it was what rotational grazing and then  it was mob grazing then it was strip grazing and then it's take all grazing  and it's big yeah yeah we practice adaptive grazing it has to be adaptive  
**[0:38:48-0:39:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:38:48):**  to our lifestyle further you know for I think there's too many terms that are  used interchangeably that nobody's really got a that there's not a  consensus definition on yeah so we try to I mean on on average our cows get  
**[0:39:03-0:39:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:39:03):**  moved daily every 24 hours if you'd average out some times we're moving  every two hours with ultra stock density just really trying to get some  trampling down sometimes we're moving you know every 12 hours sometimes we  
**[0:39:20-0:39:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:39:20):**  move a paddock every two days maybe it's five days if we're implementing some  poly wire but we're trying to keep the cow herd moving and and a lot of it has  to do with maturity of our forage season seasonality springtime you know we're  
**[0:39:36-0:39:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:39:36):**  moving bigger chunks of ground faster you know then into the summertime we're  slowing way down and and moving slower across a paddock you know on the paddock  and we shoot for is roughly 10 acres and you know it might take us three days  
**[0:39:55-0:40:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:39:55):**  four days to get across that paddock right now but in the summertime we did  it in eight to twelve hours right spring so is it dry over there you guys deal  with drought we are dry err we've missed we've missed rains that our neighbors  
**[0:40:13-0:40:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:40:13):**  have gotten when st. Louis got the 12 inches and so we only got about two  but over the course of that time 12 is more than I've had in the last 12 months  yeah yeah they got a lot of water yeah I 12 inches in one storm like even if it  
**[0:40:36-0:40:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:40:36):**  was 12 inches in 24 hours I might be I think we'd see some runoff at that rain  yeah I think if you can imagine their compaction in st. Louis I could have made  it all ran off yeah I can imagine with all the farm fields around there and all  
**[0:40:51-0:41:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:40:51):**  the all the heavy tillage corn and heavy clay soils I imagine it all just went  down the river well yeah I also meant like road compaction you don't get much  water absorption and with roads and buildings that's a good point there's  
**[0:41:03-0:41:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:41:03):**  like yeah concrete has zero water holding capacity no soil aggregates in  concrete zero moisture infiltration right in downtown yeah that's true there's  a lot of acres that are like that yeah Houston figured that out a couple years  
**[0:41:20-0:41:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:41:20):**  ago yeah so yeah we're not as dry as like South Central Missouri but we're  right on the edge of it but I think they've been getting some getting us  some well-needed rain so what would your drought plan be we kind of when we  
**[0:41:41-0:42:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:41:41):**  started getting drier we halted kind of ours normally we try to buy some  stalkers to background in the summer for some grass for some grass customers for  their meat businesses kind of started we halted that we also when that's kind of  
**[0:42:03-0:42:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:42:03):**  our main thing you know normally we take on quite a few cattle as these fall fall  weanlings come to market we've been buying we would buy those we halted that  we normally would buy some fall bred cows you know we we halted that sold  
**[0:42:23-0:42:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:42:23):**  some cows this late spring to different people to get their herd started that's  one thing we we do we try to sell some turned around Corianne so if we a lot of  people are interested in this Corianne and the South Pole breed up but don't  
**[0:42:48-0:43:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:42:48):**  necessarily want to source the Corianne I mean there's what those cows I mean  that's a learning habit right there they got horns and people don't want to mess  with the horns and people don't know where to buy them or so we'll buy them  
**[0:43:02-0:43:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:43:02):**  oh you don't need to worry about them horrors they're gentle they're just big  grass puppies for the most part until you and we we've caved a few and I mean  and the wild ones are the ones that stand we had one our first Corianne to  
**[0:43:16-0:43:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:43:16):**  ever calf stood on our all four feet on the four-wheeler and so we try to get  those type sorted off and and and we send those down the road to a to a guy  that's just that buys butcher cows so we try to get in Corianne's and we'll clean  
**[0:43:34-0:43:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:43:34):**  them up as far as most the time Corianne's need a warming so we do warm  them once and then well that's all mine have been wormed exactly once yeah I  just got to get the arena dirt flushed out of them and then we'll put them on  
**[0:43:49-0:44:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:43:49):**  grass and and we'll make sure they're calm and they they'll stay behind poly  wire and if and that they can be around I mean and other than that you know  somebody wants some a few Corianne cows to start their herd with you know I feel  
**[0:44:04-0:44:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:44:04):**  pretty confident that you'd get a you'd get a nice started cow that you know can  be turned out what do you say to the people that say that they'll just jump  out any fence you want to put them in I would say I've seen one and I mean we've  
**[0:44:22-0:44:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:44:22):**  had we got a hundred hundred and fifty or so Corianne's I've seen one jump out  of a fence but I've also seen a South Pole jump out of a corral I've seen an  Angus jump over the fence they've seen Brahma's do all kinds of crazy acrobatic  
**[0:44:38-0:44:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:44:38):**  stunts yeah yeah I mean I I think it's just depends on the cow there's it's not  a buried thing I would agree with that 100% they are a little more athletic  than most breeds you know they're a little smaller maybe a little more  
**[0:44:51-0:45:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:44:51):**  muscly and might be a little easier for him to clear a four wire just because  that you just because they have that reputation like yeah I've seen I've seen  a 2,000 pound Angus bull clear a five-wire fence all it takes is  
**[0:45:03-0:45:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:45:03):**  motivation yeah if you have a nice herd that's handled quiet mm-hmm they want to  stay in it if you don't let them get hungry yeah they want to stay where  they're at like the only time I have any problems with my cows wanting to go  
**[0:45:19-0:45:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:45:19):**  anywhere usually they want to get on the road ditch and go to town like they  never want to get onto the neighbors for some reason they always want to get out  on the road ditch though yeah and I've only seen two jump I one I don't know  
**[0:45:33-0:45:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:45:33):**  how she got out the other one I know she she must have jumped out because when I  went to put her back I got the gate open and she walked next to the gate and  jumped over the fence but it's not they're not jumping over my poly wire  
**[0:45:48-0:45:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:45:48):**  they're jumping over the four-strand barbed wire fence yeah that's like  shoulder-high but you know that waist-high poly wire yeah for some  reason they're just terrified of it and and it's you know she was just out on  
**[0:45:59-0:46:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:45:59):**  eating a little bit and you know I'm the only one that's got horn cows so chances  are when they say there's there's a cow out I don't even have to ask how do you  know it's mine that's what I should have asked the sheriff when they called this  
**[0:46:13-0:46:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:46:13):**  morning yeah does it have horns yeah nope well then it's probably not mine  yeah so for the listeners this August stayed here in Pratt last night and so I  drove up this morning to do something against my principles and eat McDonald's  
**[0:46:31-0:46:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:46:31):**  breakfast kind of a rare treat don't judge me too harshly and I was still on  my way up here I was about 10 miles from town and I got a phone call from  sheriff's dispatch and they had a report of a calf out about three miles away  
**[0:46:46-0:46:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:46:46):**  from headquarters by the time we got there like an hour and a half later  somebody already take care of it it wasn't mine but I should have asked the  dispatcher if the if it had horns or not because that could have reduced my  
**[0:46:59-0:47:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:46:59):**  stress level a lot this morning yeah yep or was it painted yeah is it colored and  have horns nope well it ain't mine yeah when they say the black cow is out does  she have horns no chances are it's this guy's cow and I get 15 20 years ago when  
**[0:47:21-0:47:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:47:21):**  there were other colors of cattle in the country in the world besides black that  people like to have that maybe color was more of an important distinction now  it's like if somebody says there's a cow out you almost automatically assume it  
**[0:47:34-0:47:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:47:34):**  to be black and if it's not you know that's kind of like a novelty yeah yeah  cow I got called on two days ago was it was out and I said well how do you know  it's mine I said it's got he said it's white-bellied white-topped red on the  
**[0:47:53-0:48:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:47:53):**  sides white face and it has horns yeah I'll be right there sounds familiar I'm  on it I don't get too many calls like that I've this is my second call and a  knock on wood I'm not gonna even say it's my second call in a while so I mean  
**[0:48:16-0:48:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:48:16):**  I don't get called a ton but we also do you have good neighbors that you know if  they see something out that they'll stop and help you or they just drive by and  wave well I mean it just depends most of the time yeah they'll let me know I got  
**[0:48:32-0:48:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:48:32):**  good neighbors that keep an eye on stuff but we're all kind of a try to stay  tight and be good to our neighbors I mean some of our neighbors get to hunt  you get to hunt you know but we want to know when the cow if a cow is out most  
**[0:48:47-0:49:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:48:47):**  of the time they'll put them away and just say hey this cow is out take a  picture of it and say we put them away or she's locked up in the corral or  something like that so my worry is we got a hundred acre cornfield nine my  
**[0:49:00-0:49:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:49:00):**  cows are trained to eat when they move so if you get out I know right I know  right where they're going and like that guy's expressed his extreme displeasure  at your horned cattle opinion that cows don't belong on any crop ground okay and  
**[0:49:22-0:49:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:49:22):**  so probably an older gentleman been farming the same way for 40 odd years no  he's probably a 40 year old gentleman and I don't know just a different  context maybe well I don't know maybe he listened to his college professors not  
**[0:49:48-0:50:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:49:48):**  everybody's heard of the principles of soil health yet apparently nope that's a  parent and a lot of situations education I mean we talked a little bit about it I  think education's I mean so important and so what are some what are some good  
**[0:50:07-0:50:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:50:07):**  resources that have been very helpful helpful for you I mean Facebook's got a  great network in a bunch of groups I podcast quite a bit I do audible any  good podcast you listen to oh yeah there's a few of them  
**[0:50:29-0:50:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:50:29):**  ranching reboot yeah that don't worry about that one oh okay working cows how's  that one that one's all right all right herd quitter listen to herd quitter work  herd quitter is good then I'm a Joe Rogan experience guy I have to get a  
**[0:50:46-0:51:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:50:46):**  little bit of experience I'm I'm on the jre train to I'm I'm probably three  months behind though yeah I catch up on Joe under winter yeah I catch up on Joe  in the winter about springtime we're caught up and then summertime and I  
**[0:51:03-0:51:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:51:03):**  start falling behind again yeah so I audiobook quite a bit lately any good  ones yeah one of my favorites cattle kingdom by Christopher Nolting let's see  we were talking about Empire the summer moon on the way up yeah that's crazy  
**[0:51:22-0:51:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:51:22):**  that's right down in this area yeah so Empire the summer moon they talk about  that's a book about the the rise and the fall of Comanche Indians correct yep for  those that are unfamiliar and where my ranch is located I feel like I'm kind of  
**[0:51:42-0:52:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:51:42):**  in the extreme north east area of where the Comanches would have been and it's  kind of a meeting area between several different tribes so is I've kind of  understood that the Medicine Lodge area from the native perspective as it wasn't  
**[0:52:00-0:52:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:52:00):**  an area that was really inhabited by one tribe that it was shared by several  for the healing properties of the water okay so let me explain that so I live in  the red hills I go by red hills rancher another name for the area is the Gip  
**[0:52:16-0:52:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:52:16):**  Hills so you saw it today August the the white Caprock future in the hills well  that's calcium sulfide and it gets into the water it makes the water hard and it  makes the water kind of function like a laxative really yeah so be careful  
**[0:52:33-0:52:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:52:33):**  drinking the tap water this water is good water at my house is okay water  down at my dad's is an acquired taste we'll put it that way so the Indians  kind of felt that the water here had some had some medicinal properties so  
**[0:52:54-0:53:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:52:54):**  this was more of a shared area like arrowheads I don't think I've ever  found an arrowhead actually on the ranch really yeah yeah not sure why just  haven't found any there you know is that does it just due to terrain and it  
**[0:53:15-0:53:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:53:15):**  wasn't good hunting terrain yeah when they were in charge I don't know you  know I'd love to have a crystal ball or have a time machine and be able to go  back and observe and see what things are like or see what things are really like  
**[0:53:28-0:53:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:53:28):**  because the crap we've written in the history books and that we kind of like  guessed that and even the stuff some of stuff you and I were talking about  earlier today driving around we're just guessing yeah yeah and just yeah  
**[0:53:43-0:53:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:53:43):**  whatever somebody wrote down and just because there wasn't any of this animal  that one day you walk through that area the next day maybe a whole herd of them  came through and then and had a party and you never knew about it you'll write  
**[0:53:58-0:54:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:53:58):**  down didn't see a single rabbit the whole trip you know that doesn't mean  they weren't there that just means you didn't see them yep yep 100% um another  resource back onto your question I mean what a soil health Academy understanding  
**[0:54:17-0:54:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:54:17):**  AG I've just finished my second so I'll Health Academy that's what brought me to  Kansas they did a collaboration with Dallas Mount looking forward to go into  ranching for profit here probably in the next year there's no ding there because  
**[0:54:33-0:54:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:54:33):**  I'm on a I'm not in the right studio sorry guys and just a bunch of other  local stuff we we are intentional about learning try to I mean we try to spend a  couple thousand bucks a year just on continuing our education so we can we  
**[0:54:52-0:55:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:54:52):**  can be the best stewards of the land produce the best product out there  continuing ed and training should be a line item on everybody's budget yeah and  I think for for most people it's not and tragically yes and I mean you can get  
**[0:55:09-0:55:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:55:09):**  stuck in your ways if without learning but really really easy matter of fact a  pushback I hear is anybody can write a book and anybody can tell you something  so you just I don't know how to respond to that but that's true that's very true  
**[0:55:30-0:55:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:55:30):**  and there's a lot of people that can do and can't write and there's a lot of  people that can write and not do but finding the person that can do and write  about it effectively you know then you get an Aldo Leopold you know then you  
**[0:55:50-0:56:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:55:50):**  get somebody that gets remembered for a hundred or two hundred years you get an  Allen Savory that's written a book you know even though he's changed it to 15  times it's still there yeah buddy I mean you got to change it right because I  
**[0:56:04-0:56:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:56:04):**  mean as you learn more if you don't acknowledge that you got it wrong or  that you haven't learned more I mean that's why you get I mean that's called  a tenured professor sir there's so many changes from second to third then from  
**[0:56:28-0:56:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:56:28):**  third to fourth you know I can understand why some of his critics  you're like well he keeps changing everything well that's not settled it's  not static I mean it's a living system we're still participating in it we're  
**[0:56:40-0:56:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:56:40):**  still learning yeah a hundred percent I mean it's not like how arrogant is it to  think that you know a person is 20s 30s or 40s does research comes to a  conclusion mm-hmm and over the next 30 or 40 years absolutely nothing can ever  
**[0:56:57-0:57:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:56:57):**  come up to challenge that conclusion yeah because they build their whole  career their whole life their whole identity around that legend that they  built around that that body of research they did that maybe now if they went  
**[0:57:11-0:57:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:57:11):**  back and looked at it wouldn't be correct or it'd be an incorrect  conclusion or there's a new way to study the data that would tell them something  different they're not gonna want to do that yeah they're not gonna want to  
**[0:57:21-0:57:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:57:21):**  update that and find out something different because they're gonna want to  defend their bedrock of their identity mm-hmm as vigorously as they can yeah  and they're not even gonna they can't even accept that there's a new idea that  
**[0:57:36-0:57:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:57:36):**  somebody else may be more correct than them because in their mind this was  their thing they did this 20 years ago this is what they're known for and  that's the hill they're gonna die on yeah unfortunately yeah you know we we  
**[0:57:51-0:58:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:57:51):**  have guys like you know we talked about Ray Archuleta yep okay so for those that  don't know don't know uncle Ray he worked for the government for a lot of  years right and he was kind of constricted on what he could say mm-hmm  
**[0:58:03-0:58:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:58:03):**  as soon as he retires he goes to work for understanding AG and he's you know  he's making people at conferences get up and do stretches at seven o'clock in the  morning talking about mycorrhizal fungi yeah you know we need we need a lot more  
**[0:58:21-0:58:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:58:21):**  Ray Archuleta's in the world I think we need a lot more people that take that  risk of being different right the Dallas Mounts yeah dr. Alan Williams the people  that you know have a job with the university or a tenured professor but  
**[0:58:40-0:58:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:58:40):**  then recognize that things have happened and changed and we're going the wrong  direction or you know that some of this stuff might not be true and then  standing up and and doing something about it I mean it's it seems like those  
**[0:58:57-0:59:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:58:57):**  of us that have been not those of us it seems like some some folks that are  quote on that have been fringe like Dallas Mount okay like Dallas Mount at  the NCBA convention two years ago would have gone over about as well as a turd  
**[0:59:14-0:59:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:59:14):**  in a punch bowl I mean you go talk to the guys at NCBA about putting profit  into ranching they're probably gonna laugh at you  maybe that's just my feeling okay maybe I just made that up but it seems like  
**[0:59:29-0:59:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:59:29):**  that's really changing it seems like those of us that the industry is  considered Mavericks and outliers that they're starting that the mainstream is  starting to listen to us now yeah they're turning around they're looking  
**[0:59:41-1:00:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=0:59:41):**  and they're going okay Hayes expensive cakes expensive there's no grass now  what do I do yeah you know I bet you there's people out there I mean what I  tell you worth worth three or four weeks from recording to release date on  
**[1:00:07-1:00:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:00:07):**  release day there will still be guys west of here that don't know we're in  drought that's kind of scary I mean do you think would you would you agree that  there's guys around here that we drove past today that don't know we're in a  
**[1:00:25-1:00:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:00:25):**  drought I would say unless they looked at the drought map but but I don't know  I mean it it looks dry I mean it but it doesn't seem like any any management  strategies have changed right I mean and I haven't seen many yeah and you know  
**[1:00:45-1:01:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:00:45):**  this they're stocked up I mean they're feeding hay I mean we're in August you  weren't feeding hay and you had had quite a bit of grass and quite a few  cows a lot more than I've seen on some of these places I have zero grass well I  
**[1:01:02-1:01:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:01:02):**  mean I did kind of see the drought coming yeah and it's and I did de-stock  early I came in light because I don't want to feed hay yeah it's expensive  it's expensive to make I don't have a tractor I don't have a baler  
**[1:01:16-1:01:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:01:16):**  diesel's over still over four dollars a gallon mm-hmm  you know who knows what it's gonna be about time this comes out it might be  three dollars again who knows yeah that'd be nice wouldn't it yeah you were  
**[1:01:30-1:01:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:01:30):**  intentional with every every your action plan and you stuck to it and you had a  plan you had a game plan you saw them the markers you know I'm sure you had my  plans not to feed hay you know wait yeah when I make my grazing plan in the  
**[1:01:44-1:02:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:01:44):**  spring mm-hmm my grazing plan gets me through next winter like when I start  making a grazing plan in April in March to start in April yo okay that grazing  plan is valid from April 1 to March 31 mm-hmm because I'm not I don't need to  
**[1:02:04-1:02:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:02:04):**  just worry about the grass that I can eat this summer I've got a plan the  grass that I grow during that really narrow hundred twenty two hundred fifty  day window right I've got a plan and budget that grass for 365 days a year  
**[1:02:18-1:02:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:02:18):**  yeah and you know that's a call we're making in February March yeah that you  you got to live with it for a while which is a big part of why I like custom  grazing because you know I can float that custom grazing number up a lot  
**[1:02:37-1:02:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:02:37):**  easier you know I can change that number up a lot easier than I can change my cow  number then I can then I can alter my heifers right I mean I've got to have a  long term you know when I started down this road two years ago knew it was a  
**[1:02:55-1:03:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:02:55):**  long-term deal didn't have the money to fully stock the ranch with my own cows  and that would never be part of the plan anyway because if you're fully stocked  with your own stuff then what do you do then what's your drought reserve do you  
**[1:03:06-1:03:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:03:06):**  have another ranch somewhere else or you have something that you can get rid of  that's not gonna cost you a lot of money yeah we've been selling overvalued stuff  so at the time when we were selling we were selling steers were overvalued so  
**[1:03:19-1:03:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:03:19):**  we were selling stuff that would go to our meat business so but I mean or you  know in a drought we've been working on this cow herd you know trying to have  the ultimate low low input cow that survives in our environment on you know  
**[1:03:38-1:03:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:03:38):**  fescue grass and salt rock salt so yeah and those are tough decisions right but  a plan helps a plan helps you make them for sure  introducing c90 ocean minerals c90 offers complete nutrient support for

**[1:05:05-1:05:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:05:05):**  drowted out I mean I'm assuming some of your cash flow comes from them so how do  you how do you work that in most of my cash flow comes from customer cows yeah  basically all my cash flow comes from customer cows mm-hmm so when you're  
**[1:05:24-1:05:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:05:24):**  de-stocking 40% yeah it hurts yeah so do you so if that point comes do you have  to sell what what's your plan you know do you have to sell your your quarry any  cows to keep your custom cows I'm not to that point and I don't think I ever  
**[1:05:50-1:06:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:05:50):**  would be no I'm not I'm not worried about running out of grass my problem  right now is like affordability of winter protein and deciding how much of  it I'm gonna feed mm-hmm okay grass I'm I'm I say I'm swimming in grass I'm  
**[1:06:08-1:06:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:06:08):**  swimming in grass for my 80 a you or so heard mm-hmm okay throw another 80 in  there and it's gonna start to look pretty lean yeah you know I could carry  my 80 my 80 I've got plenty of grass to get me to April and then I could come  
**[1:06:25-1:06:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:06:25):**  in with all kinds of customer cows in April and make money next year I just  got to get there and getting there means a little bit of winter feed bill because  I just can't get through the winter without without feeding some protein  
**[1:06:38-1:06:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:06:38):**  yeah we rode around on some of the best stuff that I have today you know some  creek bottom am I gonna grow some cool season grass down there yeah yeah I am  if it rains yeah you know it's kind of playing on that last year and I know  
**[1:06:56-1:07:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:06:56):**  what kind of moisture we got last year through the through and I know what kind  of cool season grass I had last year and what kind of protein I fed mm-hmm I know  they can get by on not a whole lot like yeah I just fed some alfalfa bales every  
**[1:07:11-1:07:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:07:11):**  couple of days like never more than one bale of alfalfa every couple of days and  as a season went on that went to one every three then one every four days so  they didn't get much no they just got enough and you know if we're really  
**[1:07:28-1:07:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:07:28):**  trying to drive the low input ethic and the low input mentality you know  continue driving those inputs to zero you know and if I'm driving inputs to  zero you know what what are the inputs that I'm still choosing to use and you  
**[1:07:46-1:07:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:07:46):**  know every year it's a little bit different you know how you gonna work  the math of getting the right amount of protein to your animals and what's the  best delivery mechanism you know is a liquid product is it a tub product is it  
**[1:07:57-1:08:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:07:57):**  cube product or is it a bale product right you know what's the most  cost-effective to get the protein into the cows that they need to be able to  perform for me it's more than that okay because I always you know I'm on this  
**[1:08:11-1:08:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:08:11):**  low input train and I'm always preaching low inputs low inputs low inputs and for  the last year and a half have been talking about supply chains about  shortening your supply chains okay maybe inputs necessarily aren't that bad if  
**[1:08:26-1:08:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:08:26):**  they come from next door yeah or if they come from or if there's only maybe one  or two hands between it and you and it's a pretty short chain like you know what  am I saying here like so alfalfa I can feed alfalfa and bales that's a one  
**[1:08:48-1:09:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:08:48):**  handling process you know there's there's there's not a middleman in  there there's not another value add process that needs to be done from the  time that it gets bailed to the time that I feed it okay yeah you could take  
**[1:09:00-1:09:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:09:00):**  that alfalfa and pellet eyes it that doesn't increase anything it just adds a  little bit of cost maybe you know makes it a little more efficient to store  transfer maybe the cost comes down a little bit you could put about anything  
**[1:09:12-1:09:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:09:12):**  you want in a cube dry distillers grains cottonseed holes whatever okay but I  always want to consider that source you know do I really want to feed cotton  seed holes to my cows after everything that gets sprayed on those cotton seeds  
**[1:09:27-1:09:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:09:27):**  on that cotton I mean I'm not asking you if you would I'm just saying it's really  it'd be really hard for me to think about one to feed cottonseed cake to my  cows no one how many times chemicals are sprayed on cotton yeah so we don't only  
**[1:09:45-1:09:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:09:45):**  have to think about what we're feeding what it's gonna cost and what the  cheapest way to get the protein in the cow is it's like what's the other junk  that's riding along with it you know what else might be in here we don't  
**[1:09:57-1:10:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:09:57):**  necessarily want and you know you look at a tub like a cook tub type product  that's got a balanced mineral package in it and probiotics and molasses and  protein from this source that's an industrial byproduct tub you might as  
**[1:10:16-1:10:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:10:16):**  well go down to Burger King and get a you know get a beyond burger or whatever  they call it yeah get one of those fake meat burgers are there some tubs that  are probably okay yeah but I go back to the thing that Steve Campbell likes to  
**[1:10:30-1:10:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:10:30):**  talk about are we feeding the right kind of minerals is copper copper is  magnesium magnesium is cadmium cadmium right you know is it bioavailable is is  are the mineral packages that we're putting in this tub are they bioavailable  
**[1:10:44-1:11:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:10:44):**  yeah that's a good question I mean the feed salesman says they are right well  of course the feed salesman says that he's trying to sell you feed you know  who do you trust though I guess ancient products you know products without pure  
**[1:11:02-1:11:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:11:02):**  products pure products yeah you know things like sea salt salt yep you know  we think about you know that the cattle 200 years ago mm-hmm they didn't they  didn't go stand in feed lot and get fed corn for 120 days then you get a total  
**[1:11:22-1:11:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:11:22):**  mixture ashen we didn't get a feed them you know we didn't have sodium  bicarbonate available in large quantities to feed them to control  acidosis we didn't have any of this stuff yeah and cattle seem to get along  
**[1:11:37-1:11:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:11:37):**  just fine it seems like the more we try to keep like the more we can find them  in feedlots the more we try to tune these TMRs and the more we mess with  them the more problems we have with them with getting sick you know I'm pink eye  
**[1:11:52-1:12:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:11:52):**  foot rot outbreaks have you know things like BRD things like happened a couple  months ago out west out in western Kansas where they had an overnight heat  burst and 10,000 head of cattle died I don't care I don't care about feeding  
**[1:12:12-1:12:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:12:12):**  the world I want to feed my family and I want to feed my community I don't care  about feeding the world anymore I don't care about feeding the starving pygmies  in New Guinea anymore god bless them we live in the middle of food deserts you  
**[1:12:31-1:12:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:12:31):**  and Missouri me here in Kansas as we sit here in downtown Pratt we're in a food  desert there's a feedlot just north we're surrounded by corn beans cotton  and wheat there's a little bit of Milo some some sorghum sedan based feed that  
**[1:12:47-1:13:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:12:47):**  we saw up here where's the lettuce where's the carrots where's the sheep  where's the goats where's the chickens I'd say where's the hogs and I almost  did but there's a there's a confinement hog barn about five miles south of town  
**[1:13:00-1:13:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:13:00):**  I still would count that as hog farm yeah I mean it's industrial hog farm  coming straight to your grocery store here in town probably none I mean they're  going from that hog farm back to an industrial hog plant mm-hmm to a you  
**[1:13:15-1:13:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:13:15):**  know yeah supply chains there's very little that's grown in this area that's  consumed in this area it's almost all exported and American farmers pat  yourselves on the back every American farmer grows enough food to feed 160  
**[1:13:34-1:14:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:13:34):**  people great job who's eating that corn who's eating those soybeans who's eating  that cotton oh we clothe the world with our cotton 50% of clothes that get made  end up in a landfill you know growing all the corn and soybeans who you sell  
**[1:14:00-1:14:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:14:00):**  it to who's your customer for that you're not feeding the world with corn  and soybeans I'm sorry you're not feeding the world you're feeding  subsidized drain to somebody else's cows in a feedlot so the Packers can make  
**[1:14:13-1:14:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:14:13):**  money oh well I mean and there's also all the fructose corn products right oh  yeah well we got to make all these by we got to grow all this corn so we can you  know take it apart and make all these other products out of it like Doritos  
**[1:14:27-1:14:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:14:27):**  don't eat them okay that's a lie they're too delicious I can't stop I can't not  eat them but I can at least not buy them at the grocery store somebody offers me  a bag I'm probably not gonna turn down but I mean it's nutrient density right  
**[1:14:46-1:15:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:14:46):**  that's that's not that's a word that no one talks about in the grocery store you  don't go in and say can I have your most nutrient dense produce or your most  nutrient dense meat or your most nutrient dense bag of chips the manager  
**[1:15:04-1:15:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:15:04):**  is just gonna look at you like you're an idiot and hand you whatever product  it's closest yeah you know like nutrient density so that can be like a tricky  subject right yeah because you got to kind of back up what you say right mm-hmm  
**[1:15:24-1:15:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:15:24):**  and I'm gonna say nutrient density of food isn't ain't what it used to be yeah  and there's a lot there's there's studies that are coming out I think  there's people waking up to that that you know the strawberries we have now  
**[1:15:38-1:15:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:15:38):**  are not the strawberries we had in 1980 yep the avocados that everybody thinks  are super foods may not be because maybe they just tested a super organic  regeneratively grown avocado and these commercial avocados don't have anything  
**[1:15:52-1:16:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:15:52):**  in them like commercial like tomatoes I almost can't stand eating a tomato from  the grocery store tomato sauce out of a jar we made some pasta the other day at  home from garden tomatoes I felt fine ate tomato sauce out of a can I'll get  
**[1:16:12-1:16:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:16:12):**  heartburn yeah how does that work it's crazy I don't you know like why do we  need to add sugar to our tomatoes why are we adding sugar to canned tomatoes  that doesn't make any sense they've got no flavor we've bread all the flavor  
**[1:16:28-1:16:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:16:28):**  out so produce pounds pounds and appearance like consistency  consistency volume and appearance with no regard to taste and no regard to  nutrient density because we can flavor our way out of it just like yeah yeah  
**[1:16:50-1:17:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:16:50):**  Dorito dust yeah yeah I'm one of the weird people I never I never put ranch  on everything growing up mm-hmm hey I was I was always discouraged from using  a lot of salad dressings and especially dipping sauces condiments I was always  
**[1:17:11-1:17:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:17:11):**  really discouraged from using condiments especially ketchup yep I don't eat  ketchup I am one of the weird people on earth I do not like ketchup I will put  ketchup on exactly nothing that I eat if I was a single guy you would not find  
**[1:17:28-1:17:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:17:28):**  ketchup in my refrigerator I it's not that I hate it I just simply don't care  for it because the first time I went to put ketchup on something my dad yelled  at me and he said that's nothing but sugar would eat net crap eat your food  
**[1:17:45-1:18:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:17:45):**  you don't need to put sugar on it okay  that's fine so I just never learned to put ketchup on my french fries and I  never have so it's like so I was in the Navy for eight and a half years and then  
**[1:18:09-1:18:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:18:09):**  when I came back here and I started kind of reintegrate whatever that means back  into the real world like I'd go out to eat and I'd notice people like dipping  their pizza in ranch dressing what is this you're putting you're dipping your  
**[1:18:26-1:18:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:18:26):**  pizza in ranch dressing that's the weirdest thing I've ever seen and then I  tried it once and I'm like oh that ain't bad now great okay this was this was  years ago before I kind of before I jumped on the eating healthy and  
**[1:18:39-1:18:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:18:39):**  regenerative ag bus but yeah there were a lot of years that I would that I'd  dip my pizza in ranch dressing and then I remembered what high fructose corn  syrup was and what soybean oil was and I don't do it anymore yeah but it was  
**[1:18:54-1:19:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:18:54):**  delicious for a while yeah it's good I mean it's but sugar right it's flavored  to be good to disguise or to help eat foods that the flavors been taken out of  right out of it's it's market research it's Marcus research focus groups and  
**[1:19:19-1:19:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:19:19):**  market testing right so what does everybody like to eat you know like  there's certain combinations that light up parts of your brain that were  hardwired to you know like the sugar this deal the salty the sweet the crunch  
**[1:19:32-1:19:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:19:32):**  you know there's things that that like that make our brain go nuts that we  can't control and these food companies have figured that out and they spend  millions of dollars yeah to hire really really smart people to design the like  
**[1:19:50-1:20:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:19:50):**  to tweak the scent of like peach rings candy right they'll hire somebody and  pay the millions of dollars to tweak how the strawberry starburst tastes yeah to  get it just perfect yep to make you want to buy it because it's it's like it's  
**[1:20:10-1:20:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:20:10):**  lighting up all these pleasure centers in your brain and they spent millions of  dollars researching psychology and testing different color combinations of  wrappers and packaging to see what draws the eye and what keeps the attention the  
**[1:20:28-1:20:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:20:28):**  most you ever drive by notice all the Mexican restaurants all have the same  color scheme yeah I mean now you say it I mean they're always brighter and  fancier there's a reason why because those yellow green red that yellow green  
**[1:20:44-1:21:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:20:44):**  red spectrum that a lot of the Mexican restaurants use makes you hungry and you  didn't even know that I only know that because I watched a YouTube video on it  I don't know if we talked about that in my first I haven't but I will put that  
**[1:21:04-1:21:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:21:04):**  down all the lists you're not the first person to recommend Dorito effect so  I've been caught up listening to let's see I listen to wastelands at Mike  Callicrate recommendation that's a book about hog farmers in eastern North  
**[1:21:22-1:21:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:21:22):**  Carolina and fighting and lawsuits with Smithfield and yeah Smithfield foods  that's a good one yep yep Smithfield foods Chinese own company one of the  largest pork producers in the United States kind of like kind of like JBS  
**[1:21:41-1:21:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:21:41):**  and Marfrig who owns national beef are two of the largest beef producers and  they're both Brazilian owned yeah he wouldn't think that foreign owned owner  foreign ownership of our food supply is a national security problem with it I  
**[1:21:58-1:22:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:21:58):**  think it's only only 15% though right yeah that's it so anyway I read I didn't  read I don't read much anymore wastelands I listened to wastelands on  audible and then the next one that I listened to was collapse by Jared not  
**[1:22:21-1:22:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:22:21):**  know that was I listen that a while ago  where'd it go the end of the world is just beginning that was a good one  that's by Peter Z Han and that just came out back in June and yeah the end of the  
**[1:22:41-1:22:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:22:41):**  world is just beginning that is a good book and then after that I went through  permanent record by Ed Snowden and I just finished that one a couple weeks  like a week ago so I'm kind of in between books I think I'll have to go  
**[1:22:54-1:23:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:22:54):**  ahead and find Dorito effect and and get that one queued up yeah I'm waiting for  Fred Provenza's nourishment right in that coming out in the next couple months  I thought he said well it's out but he didn't read it like the copy where he's  
**[1:23:11-1:23:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:23:11):**  reading it I think is still coming yeah it's coming out yeah yeah yeah yeah  I'm looking forward to that yeah yeah Fred who a wealth of information man I  could have talked to that guy all day but it all ties into back what we were  
**[1:23:27-1:23:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:23:27):**  just talking about our food scene and nutrient density and you know  recognizing that a strawberries a strawberry should have the nutritional  density of a strawberry and that's basically what comes back down to like  
**[1:23:42-1:23:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:23:42):**  as we get into this these the grazing of our cattle and they we start changing  our plant diversity and they're going around and selecting different plants and  different times of the year and teaching their steers and their heifers and their  
**[1:23:57-1:24:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:23:57):**  bulls how to forge and what to eat and I mean it's crazy what they'll eat now and  it's not just our Korean ease you know it's our commercial black cows that but  those commercial black cows are the cows that have stayed in our system as we  
**[1:24:13-1:24:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:24:13):**  pulled the inputs out so they've you know we've been ever since 2016 2018 19  we started to really start changing our management style and really pushing them  hard grazing pulling the inputs and really focusing on increasing our plant  
**[1:24:41-1:25:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:24:41):**  diversity and letting that cow do the work and fend for herself and so you  were saying that you've had some black cows for a while and they're starting to  eat differently like eat a different variety mm-hmm and I've been I've been  
**[1:25:00-1:25:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:25:00):**  thinking about that for a long time like so do we think of your basic cow calf  operation like you know your your standard middle-road cow calf operation  you're gonna go stand in pasture for six months you're gonna calving the pasture  
**[1:25:16-1:25:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:25:16):**  and then you're gonna come back to the pens we know about six months old that  cow is gonna be on a hay ration for basically six months out of the year  until it's time to go back to grass mm-hmm that's pretty typical right so as  
**[1:25:30-1:25:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:25:30):**  we keep our cows in the pasture longer and longer and longer and make them work  harder further make them rustle their own grub for lack of a better term  especially during the winter when grass can be kind of lean in my part of the  
**[1:25:44-1:26:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:25:44):**  world you know lean on protein lean on nutrition and they've got to eat a lot  to get enough mass it you're seeing changes in how your black cattle eat  compared to your horn cattle we're just seeing that diversity I mean I mean  
**[1:26:03-1:26:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:26:03):**  everybody says Cory any is like a goat I mean some are picky you know especially  if they come out of like an arena dirt floor where they're used to eating lawn  clippings that they only get fed when they mow against the thing you know when  
**[1:26:17-1:26:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:26:17):**  they mow around the arena and blow it out into the on to the dirt you know  other than that they're picking a couple weeds here and there but when we started  with these cows in 2016 I'm talking our original base you know black black  
**[1:26:32-1:26:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:26:32):**  cattle and we still have a few we have a very very few of those left but those  generations that they've had they're the offspring that those cows have had and  then the offspring that those cows have had so we're talking granddaughters  
**[1:26:48-1:27:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:26:48):**  right there their selection is way higher than just than their grandmothers  right there what they their diversity and in their diet is you know closer to  what people associate the Cory any cows diet like they're going out and they're  
**[1:27:14-1:27:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:27:14):**  eating yuccas they're going out like the first hour in the pasture yeah they're  going out they're going to the willows yeah they're going I mean they'll have  grass everywhere but they're going to the going to the Forbes was that you know  
**[1:27:29-1:27:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:27:29):**  that wasn't it was me if you didn't hear that on a recording there's some weird  noises going around we're not real sure if it's under us or the building next  door or what but yeah anyway you know what's in it when they go eat a willow  
**[1:27:41-1:28:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:27:41):**  tree and they're eating the bark off the willow you know what that is it's a form  of salicylic acid okay which is the precursor to acetyl salicylic acid which  is Tylenol anti-inflammatory or no aspirin not not Tylenol aspirin yeah  
**[1:28:00-1:28:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:28:00):**  it's a precursor to aspirin so it's a pain relief interest must have stepped  on a thorn or something or they just have a tummy ache yeah that's crazy I  don't know why they eat yuccas though I don't either or like why they decide to  
**[1:28:14-1:28:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:28:14):**  eat leaves off a blackberry bush or off the rose bush or or off the sumac yeah I  don't know or sagebrush I've seen him eating sagebrush too I know their  nutritional wisdom is way more than I'll ever know about them I've seen him like  
**[1:28:32-1:28:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:28:32):**  standing in big bluestem grass mm-hmm up to like the mid body mm-hmm and watched  him eat sagebrush yeah I don't I don't understand uh-huh don't understand  growing big bluestem is hard growing sagebrush is easy so eat all the sagebrush  
**[1:28:49-1:29:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:28:49):**  you like yeah and I don't know everybody's an expert especially when it  comes to Facebook and their opinions of your posts but I had posted some blue  stick big bluestem which is pretty uncommon for our area do most of your  
**[1:29:10-1:29:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:29:10):**  neighbors even know what that looks like I don't think so because I saw where  somebody had sprayed some in a fence row sounds about right so I doubt it but I  had a comment that I'd let my big bluestem get too mature and put put some  
**[1:29:29-1:29:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:29:29):**  weenling some fall weenling calves in there and they started at the seed heads  and eight they didn't even start at the bottom like there the leaves are and let  me guess that was a second week of September first or second week of  
**[1:29:44-1:30:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:29:44):**  September no July July yeah what month wow you already had seed heads I'd  early yeah huh yep okay but it got one thing that happened was a week we got  dry we got hot and dry if you had a lot made a difference if you had a lot of  
**[1:30:06-1:30:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:30:06):**  early moisture yeah and then it just quit and got hot and dry real hot that'll  drive that'll drive those plants out of like straight to phase three for stem  and seed head like my gamma grass in my yard was laid over looking for a drink  
**[1:30:20-1:30:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:30:20):**  we had a I think it was a week it was a really nice week it was like a hundred  hundred and five but like precariously low humidity for our area and it was  just nice to be outside what's precariously low humidity like 50% for  
**[1:30:35-1:30:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:30:35):**  you probably less than you don't wear it when you go outside yeah single digits  would be here and who 105 at 5% humidity is angry yeah it's not pleasant yeah  with you yeah but then again you know I don't want to have 88 with 88% either  
**[1:30:55-1:31:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:30:55):**  those days aren't fun yeah and that's probably more what we are you know or  higher humidity hot but yeah so they got dry and that's when we saw a lot of  these warm seasons going putting on these littler seed heads you know are  
**[1:31:11-1:31:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:31:11):**  kind of really calm like grease grass and quack grass and okay foxtail you  know it went to seed head seed earlier than even some of our ragweed varieties  because I keep track on pasture map right you know so I can make oh you know  
**[1:31:28-1:31:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:31:28):**  I can look back refer say oh my gosh you know when the ragweeds at this this  picture you know at this presentation this stage of growth you know I know my  cows will eat it so we need to pack up where we are hike down there get those  
**[1:31:43-1:32:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:31:43):**  grazed off and then pack pack off and been using pasture map for that and I  was looking and I tried to scroll back and it was like a month month and a half  early really yeah I think everything this year is gonna be a little bit late  
**[1:32:02-1:32:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:32:02):**  going to seed here yeah I think that the hot temperatures and the lack of  rainfall is just everything is really slow and really struggling mm-hmm and I  think we're like things didn't even green up things didn't green up when we  
**[1:32:17-1:32:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:32:17):**  were expecting to it was almost 20 days probably probably right at three weeks  late to see green up this year and what's that for you normally I should be  starting to see it about third week of April second about mid-april April 15th  
**[1:32:33-1:32:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:32:33):**  April 21st and we were dang near May 7th holy cow yeah like you know traditional  grass turnout in this part of the country is first to me mm-hmm and we're  on our second spring flush rotation by then normally and we were late this year  
**[1:32:51-1:33:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:32:51):**  on that yeah it was cool dry winter and then it just turned out to be a hot dry  summer like we didn't have that it would have been nice to have kind of a you  know a transition period in there where it wasn't cold and it wasn't hot but we  
**[1:33:07-1:33:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:33:07):**  didn't get that it just went from it just seemed like it went from pretty  reasonable from hoodie weather to hundreds in two days I think that was a  lot of spots believe it was almost hoodie weather this morning that was  
**[1:33:20-1:33:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:33:20):**  kind of nice yeah it's been pretty nice today yeah how are we doing on your list  we've got about everything car oh man I mean mine mine my sheets almost full if  we got almost got yours almost empty yeah I mean I guess I was supposed to

**[1:34:02-1:34:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:34:02):**  minor fender benders that haven't been that dramatic yeah you know I'm not  gonna say breed up was a wreck I'm not gonna say fall breeding last year was a  wreck because I'm happy with what I got I'm happy with with who got bread I'm  
**[1:34:18-1:34:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:34:18):**  not upset with who's over in the cold kill pin yep Rex you know what by the  time this comes out I'll bet I'll have a bunch more because I'll be trying to  sell my first couple halves first first cows that are coming out of processing  
**[1:34:33-1:34:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:34:33):**  plant so if you're just lit if you're listening to this I forget what day I  promised they'd come out this should be episode 81 and yeah I have cows going  to the processor so and I have no idea what I'm gonna do with them I don't  
**[1:34:48-1:35:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:34:48):**  have freezer space for all of them right now like I can't go pick all of them up  from the free from the plant because I don't have enough freezer space for me  to go right now but from recording time I have seven weeks to figure that out  
**[1:35:02-1:35:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:35:02):**  yep so let it start cuz getting the call with you got three beeps that need to go  go into the freezer yeah it's faster than you think yeah yeah I know that day  will be faster I know that day will come faster than me then I want it to but  
**[1:35:19-1:35:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:35:19):**  yeah I'm looking forward to that looking forward to you know something I was like  we were talking earlier you know if you don't know where it came from you you  don't want to market that as as antibiotic free and trust me brother I  
**[1:35:32-1:35:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:35:32):**  feel that like I really feel that and I feel that to the point that even though  I've got some animals heading to the processor that have been standing on my  ranch for a minimum of two years I don't know what happened to him before that  
**[1:35:48-1:36:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:35:48):**  yeah and I just want to say that like you know my integrity means a lot to me  yeah and it's not gonna be this year it'll be next year when I when I can  sell a piece of meat from something that I know how it was cared for for every  
**[1:36:08-1:36:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:36:08):**  day of its life yeah and that's gonna be the first calf that was born on ranch we  saw him today his name's Basil he was born April 1st 2020 or yeah 2020 April  1st mm-hmm and he could have gone to the he could go to freezer camp this year  
**[1:36:24-1:36:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:36:24):**  but I think I want to see what he looks like next year yeah I think he'll be  another two it'll be at least another 200 pounds if not three or four hundred  pounds next year yeah and I think it'll be even more delicious next year yeah  
**[1:36:36-1:37:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:36:36):**  and that's gonna be the first animal in 2023 to come off this ranch that's 100%  ranch raised and the hell the deal is I didn't breed that one it's gonna be 20  24 before I can sell anybody a 100% Alexander ranch raised bread born grown  
**[1:37:00-1:37:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:37:00):**  and harvested animal be 2023 before I can do that yeah and you know what I'm  okay with that because that's that's that's the product that I want that's  that's what I want to provide that's what I want to feed my family yep you  
**[1:37:15-1:37:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:37:15):**  know I'm growing what I want to feed my family I'm growing clean meat on salt  and scenery with no antibiotics because that's what I want to eat and that's  what I want my family to eat and that's what I want to be able to give to my  
**[1:37:28-1:37:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:37:28):**  friends yeah perfect one thing that was brought up that I did a sheep school  with Jeremiah Marquain ray Archuleta they're having another one at Ray's  place this fall and but Jeremiah said something that really stuck out in my  
**[1:37:51-1:38:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:37:51):**  mind and it's everybody you know you see a lot of these regenerative type people  and they have this purest mindset you know and that if you use a tool you know  you may not be considered a regenerative rancher like if you got that cow that  
**[1:38:11-1:38:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:38:11):**  she needs some warmer you know that you're gonna warm that cow you're gonna  it's gonna be bad or you know you you have to warm a sheep you know that  that's you know bad or or something gets pink eye you know there's this there's  
**[1:38:31-1:38:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:38:31):**  all these tools out there you know you don't want to build up a cow based  around inputs but there are tools to use you know like a like a one-time warming  you know you know you might have to brush hog pasture here and there every  
**[1:38:48-1:39:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:38:48):**  couple years I think there's a lot of cattle in this country that get wormed  quote wormed for worms that don't have worms yeah yeah and like how do you know  it that's true that is a hundred percent true but I mean for the most part like a  
**[1:39:07-1:39:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:39:07):**  wormy cow I mean you can tell especially if you've been warmer free you can saw  them you can tell and a little shot of warmer and just color I mean you can  clean her up with a little bit of warmer and and just color and you don't have to  
**[1:39:24-1:39:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:39:24):**  market her as as regenerative stock we don't we if we're gonna warm something  like that it's been on our place for a while and has worms or and she gets  better we'll sell her through the barn because we don't want to pass that on to  
**[1:39:42-1:40:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:39:42):**  our to our customers right but you know also you know people talk about pulling  vaccines and and respiratory and blackleg and we do respiratory and  blackleg our calves but we got into a predicament where we didn't and we lost  
**[1:40:00-1:40:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:40:00):**  25% of our calf crop a few years ago I think no matter how low I want to go on  inputs they're still gonna be vaccine involved yeah you know the BRD  parasterelle blackleg those are those are problems out here for cows yeah and  
**[1:40:19-1:40:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:40:19):**  those aren't things that we can that that's not genetic resistance we can  breed in yeah that's just something we're not gonna get around so yeah we  gotta I think for the time being we got to solve those problems with needles  
**[1:40:31-1:40:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:40:31):**  yeah and I'm okay with that yeah and I got you know this I had this pierced  mindset that you know I'm not we're just gonna pull it we're not you know we're  not gonna do this and you know but I mean it it bit me in the ass I mean  
**[1:40:47-1:41:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:40:47):**  taking 25% of your calf crop and and it was our first year using South Pole  Bulls our first year AI in the South Pole and we lost majority of our AI'd  calves Wow that hurt that put us back a while so I'm thinking of something that  
**[1:41:06-1:41:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:41:06):**  that I saw on Facebook the guy from Sylvan aqua farms Chris Newman I think  is his name if I screwed that up please send me some hate mail so I can schedule  you for a podcast anyway he's he's getting pretty outspoken on Facebook if  
**[1:41:25-1:41:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:41:25):**  I'd encourage you to go check out Sylvan aqua farms on Facebook they're he's wild  but one of the things he says is he could he describes growing food and he  used it like he has a specific chicken example he describes growing food as  
**[1:41:41-1:42:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:41:41):**  complex multivariable calculus now I'm not real good at math but I know that  when I start running this complex multivariable calculus that's called  ranching that I can start and I can put all my XY and Z values into this  
**[1:42:01-1:42:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:42:01):**  calculation and I get to start running this calculation and while I'm running  it for a hundred and eighty or two hundred ten or two hundred and seventy days somebody  else can come by and change one of the input numbers that I can't do anything  
**[1:42:16-1:42:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:42:16):**  about yeah that's somebody being mother nature mm-hmm she can change her inputs  all the time on this complex input multivariable calculus and her one  little change can screw up all your numbers yeah and then you go back to the  
**[1:42:34-1:42:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:42:34):**  beginning as as practitioners of holistic adaptive plan grazing should  and you start again you know with a different set of input variables and  then she changes another variable midstream then you're back to one and  
**[1:42:52-1:43:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:42:52):**  the cost of getting it wrong too many times in a row is failure yeah and  there's nobody to teach you how to do this math there's not there's there's  not a math course that we could take a college like there's there's not one on  
**[1:43:16-1:43:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:43:16):**  brilliant org that that understands this that understands how infinitely very  variable you know production of food and production of livestock can be and I  feel like for the last 60 70 years it's all been fake it's all just been fake  
**[1:43:36-1:44:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:43:36):**  and held up to too high of a production number held up with too many inputs and  fossil fuels and I kind of get a little concerned about what's gonna happen  yeah that's I don't know what's gonna happen just trying to keep net profit  
**[1:44:00-1:44:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:44:00):**  you know number one priority keep inputs low yeah so how are you what's your  strategy for navigating the next few years well we're gonna focus on  education and focus on marketing and as as long as we can keep you know  
**[1:44:18-1:44:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:44:18):**  educating our consumer getting our name out there and providing a product that  the consumers like to eat then find find yes good we're gonna continue to grow  our direct-to-consumer business and I think that will help with a lot of the  
**[1:44:39-1:45:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:44:39):**  uncertainties of going forward a lot of the enemy and if we keep our input costs  down I mean one bale of hay you know we got one tractor we do most of our work  on a four-wheeler and just just really being intentional about what we do with  
**[1:45:03-1:45:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:45:03):**  our money I think is how well navigate there's something my friend McCauley  said not last episode but the one we did like episode three he he said I can't  control how much money I make I can only control how much money I spent yep  
**[1:45:20-1:45:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:45:20):**  there's a lot of truth yeah he's a smart kid man that got that kid is just yeah  yeah I met him at the Soil Health Academy I first attended at Ray's Ray's  place and super sharp and yeah he's got a lot going on and he wears me out he's  
**[1:45:38-1:45:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:45:38):**  got too much energy for me you know I saw Ray again like I said at the sheep  school and talked about all the things he was doing and got a cover crop seed  business now and actually after Ray said that I was in our local farm store and  
**[1:45:55-1:46:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:45:55):**  there was a couple of his cover crop seed bags in there which was really cool  to see well I hope he listens to this and hears that yeah big shout out yeah  yeah right so where can we find you how can how can our listeners get a hold of  
**[1:46:11-1:46:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:46:11):**  you how could people get in touch with you if they want to buy your meat right  now we're Missouri inspected beef products so it's we delivered to the  st. Louis area our website's a horseman cattle co.com you can find us on  
**[1:46:31-1:46:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:46:31):**  Instagram and Facebook at Horstman cattle Co you can find me August Horstman  on Facebook and I believe that's my Instagram name and then another thing  we're doing is we've got a grazed in America livestock page so on Facebook  
**[1:46:51-1:47:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:46:51):**  and it's a group for the transfer of ownership of regeneratively raised  livestock so kind of your one-stop shop for all things grass-fed so where's  pasture pigs on there there's guard dogs sheep goats occasional chickens and and  
**[1:47:19-1:47:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:47:19):**  cattle just trying to get a spot because it is a small market you know and it's a  niche in a niche in a niche yeah so as people try to grow their meat business I  mean that's the one thing people were running into or seeing I mean a lot of  
**[1:47:38-1:47:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:47:38):**  the people we sell steers to I mean they're just small farms you know it  doesn't make sense for them to own a cow calf operation or to produce that so we  try to produce steers for them but I mean we can't produce we can't produce  
**[1:47:51-1:48:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:47:51):**  them all right and we can't background them all for them and there's people out  there that need steers all over the place to finish or need some pigs for  their pasture pork or some guard dogs for their sheep and it's actually growing  
**[1:48:07-1:48:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:48:07):**  and I think people move quite a few quite a few critters through that site  but and just probably needs to be said that if you're joining that group I'll  get it I'll make sure I'll get links to everything in the show notes like all  
**[1:48:21-1:48:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:48:21):**  the books we talked about groups things I'll try to do a good job on the show  notes might even throw some affiliate links on some of those books if you guys  want to buy some of those books it might throw a few bucks back my way which would  
**[1:48:32-1:48:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:48:32):**  be pretty cool I'll make sure we have links for those yeah yep it's just it's  a rehoming page or a looking for no for sale so I'll put that out there yeah  yeah yeah just read the fine print and make sure you don't use the wrong words  
**[1:48:48-1:49:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:48:48):**  on Facebook to keep the group alive yeah yeah I had to go I have to review every  ad now because because people can't read instructions yeah yeah but it's all  right I guess I just get first crack at it each at each animal it comes through  
**[1:49:04-1:49:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:49:04):**  right that's another way to look at it so no but yeah just trying to grow this  community I mean it's we all have the same goal and that's to be land stewards  and try to produce a great product for for our customers to feed the world  
**[1:49:22-1:49:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/81-August-Horstmann-Grazed-in-America-e1nl8rt#t=1:49:22):**  right or feed our communities I guess we should say yeah so uh I just thought of  something we'll take we'll we'll go out on this one so there is a another friend  visited me recently and he listens to this podcast and he knows who he is and

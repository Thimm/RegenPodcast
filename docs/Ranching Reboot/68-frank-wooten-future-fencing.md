### Author(s): Red Hills Rancher

**[0:00:33-0:00:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:00:33):**  Well, hello, ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to another week of Ranching Reboot.  This episode, like all other episodes, has been sponsored by our generous patrons over  on patreon.com forward slash red hills rancher.  
**[0:00:54-0:01:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:00:54):**  Today we're going to take a little bit different of a track than we've been on lately.  And we're going to visit with a gentleman that owns a tech company that I think has  got some tech that they're working on that could be a big benefit to us all.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:01:06):**  So let's give a big warm welcome to Mr. Frank Wooten from vents.io.  Hi, Frank.  How you doing, Brian?  
**[0:01:14-0:01:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:01:14):**  I'm doing great.  It's great to finally meet up and get you here.  So what is Vents?  
**[0:01:23-0:01:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:01:23):**  That's a good question.  We're a platform to help enable the precision management of cattle, I think is the simplest  way to describe our product that involves a collar and a communications platform that  
**[0:01:38-0:01:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:01:38):**  sits behind it.  But in the end, it all is a solution.  That was a lot shorter answer than I thought you were going to give.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:01:46):**  Okay, so how does it work?  I can elaborate.  Most ranchers have a pretty good idea how it works if they think about how they run  
**[0:01:59-0:02:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:01:59):**  their operations, whether it's them using side by sides or them feeding cottonseed cake  to the cattle.  They see those cattle come running or avoiding them depending on different sounds.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:02:14):**  We tie a sound with an electric stimuli and basically that trains the cows that when they  hear that sound, they have to avoid a certain zone.  And then what we allow rancher to do is be able to draw those zones that can be either  
**[0:02:30-0:02:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:02:30):**  keep in or keep out zones anywhere across their property and manage their herd without  the need for physical fencing or without the need for people out there in the field to  move them.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:02:45):**  So what you're talking about is an app or a website that I can go to and I can draw  borders in on my ranch and then I can exclude areas where I don't want them to go.  And then all I have to do is get these collars on the couch, right?  
**[0:02:59-0:03:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:02:59):**  Correct.  Okay.  So, I mean, I have so many questions.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:03:05):**  I just don't know which one to ask first.  That's why we're here.  Let's talk.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:03:08):**  A little background, right?  Like, Frank, how did you even get into Vince?  How did you, like, what was...  
**[0:03:16-0:03:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:03:16):**  What the hell am I doing here?  Well, I was going to wait till a little later to get into that, but yeah.  Oh, you're going to wait for a couple of cocktails to kick in.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:03:23):**  That would be perfect.  So I think a lot of people, when we have new guests, it's like, we want to know how did  you find Ag and what was your background and stuff like that.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:03:38):**  Yeah.  So absolutely from nowhere near Ag, from a completely different county.  So I grew up in Annapolis, Maryland.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:03:51):**  My mom was a professor at the Naval Academy.  She's an electrical engineer.  And my dad worked in finance.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:03:58):**  And so I went to school.  I was a double major in accounting and finance.  I worked in New York for six years in kind of banking.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:04:06):**  And I got pulled out of that job to go run actually an investment firm and ran a fund  for six years.  And about 12 years into my career, basically was at a point where I had a customer base  
**[0:04:23-0:04:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:04:23):**  that said that they were thinking about the long-term, but were constantly asking me what  I'd done in the last 24 hours.  And there was just a disconnect about what I had set out to do and what I was able to  
**[0:04:34-0:04:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:04:34):**  do.  And so my business partner and I wound down our investment firm and I started to do some  consulting work for different startups in a bunch of different sectors.  
**[0:04:50-0:05:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:04:50):**  Certainly some interesting stories from that period of time in my life.  But one of the startups that I landed at and spent more time at was a insurance technology  startup based out of Sao Paulo, Brazil.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:05:03):**  And it was focused on building an insurance platform for the middle class in Brazil, which  doesn't really have access to insurance.  And I quickly found out that it was a drastically different working environment than the banking  
**[0:05:20-0:05:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:05:20):**  scene.  And it wasn't necessarily what I had been looking for.  And so as I started winding down that kind of engagement, I was approached as an investor  
**[0:05:32-0:05:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:05:32):**  basically in this crazy ass idea of throwing collars on cattle.  And I had no experience in livestock, I had no experience in ag, but I did have the experience  of the ability to really research different opportunities for my investment time in a  
**[0:05:53-0:06:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:05:53):**  way to understand the financial viability of any sort of solution.  And I think that that's probably some of the different lens that we come at to our solution  is that I started it by looking at what would work based on hundreds of income statements  
**[0:06:15-0:06:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:06:15):**  and cashflow statements and balance sheets of ranchers on a global basis.  And so we've been pretty religious about saying, look, it's got to be below this cost point  because otherwise the dog just never is going to hunt.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:06:35):**  And then once we understood kind of what that tolerance was and look, our goal will always  be can we reduce that a little bit?  What happens if we shift this to here or there?  
**[0:06:45-0:06:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:06:45):**  But we think we're in the ballpark of it right now.  And then it's like, okay, what can we build for that?  What kind of solution can we actually provide to customers that cost that?  
**[0:06:58-0:07:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:06:58):**  And that's been a six year journey candidly.  We're finally at our first commercial product and I'll stop talking here, but that's the  background.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:07:08):**  That's how we got here.  I think too, when you think about like, when is the last time anyone has really created  new technology for fencing?  
**[0:07:16-0:07:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:07:16):**  40s, 50s?  Poly wire, geared reels.  Yeah, which was invented wind.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:07:24):**  But I guess that's just another variation on electric fencing, which is, I don't know.  I actually honestly don't know when electric fencing was invented.  I think I looked up electric fencing.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:07:35):**  It was, I think electric fencing was first built in the, in the, in like 46 or something  like that.  Like it was the first time they tried it and yeah, they obviously poly reels are a completely  
**[0:07:46-0:07:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:07:46):**  different variation of that.  But it's, it's a horse by a different color.  And before that it was barbed wire was the previous major fencing innovation.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:07:58):**  Yeah.  Tamed the West, right?  Well, I know we can debate the taming and whether taming was necessary or not.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:08:06):**  That's the tagline.  I apologize.  This is a podcast so you couldn't see my fingers.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:08:13):**  Tamed the West was, was it in little quotes.  Okay.  So it's interesting that you have the background in finance and you, you know, I appreciate  
**[0:08:25-0:08:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:08:25):**  the perspective that you're approaching this from, you know, it has to make sense from  a cost basis for the producer before you can even figure out what technology you want to  deploy.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:08:36):**  And as a producer, I really appreciate that.  But I'm, I'm curious as to how a guy from the banking and finance and investment industry  got sucked into building electronic geo locate, geo fencing collars for cows.  
**[0:08:52-0:09:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:08:52):**  You know, I mean, I think that like, you think about it, like, first of all, like, how interesting  is it?  Like for me, it's like, what kind of problem do you want to be working on?  
**[0:09:06-0:09:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:09:06):**  Who do you want to be working on it for?  And how big is the opportunity?  All right.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:09:11):**  If you, if you take those, like, that's your life, right?  The majority of the time you spend that I spent in my life is working.  And probably much to the pleasure of my wife candidate.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:09:25):**  But so first of all, it's like, who are you doing the work with?  Right.  So, so Lee, one of the, the, like, and I say this to investors candidly as well, one of  
**[0:09:37-0:09:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:09:37):**  the most pleasant things that I have encountered has been working with our customer base.  You know, it's, I lived in customers' homes for about three months, you know, two and  a half years ago in different ranches across Australia and in the U S and like in no other  
**[0:09:57-0:10:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:09:57):**  industry, do you have a product that you're trying to develop for somebody where your  customer is literally hosting you, breaking bread with you and helping you develop the  product because their work is so entwined with their life that there's no separation  
**[0:10:17-0:10:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:10:17):**  between those two things.  So when you come to the table, you're a friend and you're a partner and, and, and a vendor  to them, those things are not separate to them either.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:10:27):**  And so like that, that opportunity space doesn't exist in other places.  You know, from, from actually from, from my seat at the table in terms of what customer  basis to work in and who I want to do work for.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:10:44):**  So that like, that's an easy second candidly, Brian, like, I think, you know, and I'm preaching  to you because you're like, Hey, you're talking about me.  I'm a good guy.  
**[0:10:55-0:11:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:10:55):**  Like,  Honestly, you know, if, if there's something in our industry or in any industry, really,  you know, where you have a producer or manufacturer of a product that, I guess, let me back up.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:11:11):**  When you have somebody that comes in and says, Hey, let me help you figure out how to do  this better, cheaper, make more money with less manpower.  I want to listen because, you know, manpower is my number one issue, but it's got to be  
**[0:11:24-0:11:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:11:24):**  cost appropriate for the production scale.  And to be able to work, you know, as a business owner, to be able to work directly with a  company and manufacturer or a company like yours, that all they're trying to do is help  
**[0:11:41-0:11:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:11:41):**  and develop better products for me to use.  That's a very rewarding experience.  Yeah.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:11:47):**  I think, I think it's rewarding on both.  Like, look, we're also pretty clear, like we're a for-profit company.  Like we're not running a charity, but like the only way that our business makes money  
**[0:11:57-0:12:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:11:57):**  is if you make more money, if it justifies the cost of my product.  And so, you know, I don't think that needs to be as transactional as it is in many other  industries.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:12:08):**  And, and like with, with the customer base in that I've encountered or that we've encountered  to date, you know, it's not transactional.  It's like, Hey, look, we understand you're, you're trying to run a business.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:12:19):**  So are we.  So make my business better and I'd be glad to pay you for it.  And most producers are, are fine with that.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:12:27):**  Yeah.  They may give us a hard time about, you know, wanting to reduce costs and, you know, want  it to be cheaper.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:12:32):**  I think that's, you know, that's across the board.  If you don't want the stuff you buy to be cheaper, you're probably not breathing.  So, yeah, that's, that, you know, and then last thing is the size of the market, right?  
**[0:12:49-0:13:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:12:49):**  Like there's a billion head of cattle on the planet.  Like, so if I can, if I could sell a device to every head of cattle out there, you know,  I'd be pretty happy, man.  
**[0:13:01-0:13:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:13:01):**  And then yeah, there's continuing turnover.  Yeah.  Okay.  
**[0:13:06-0:13:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:13:06):**  So tell us about, so tell us about these callers.  What, what all can they do?  You know, we, we, we sometimes get caught in this like dreamy space about what can,  
**[0:13:21-0:13:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:13:21):**  what can't, what could they do versus what can they do?  And so we like to be pretty transparent about what they can do today and about what, what  we think they can do in the future.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:13:32):**  Right.  So the, the device today is, is a control mechanism.  It enables ranchers to be able to identify exactly where their animals are.  
**[0:13:44-0:14:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:13:44):**  And then it transmits down to those animals, a schedule for lack of a better way to describe  it where you can say, I want to turn on fence in past, you know, the left fence in pasture  one at 6 AM on, you know, April 15th.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:14:03):**  And I want to turn off that fence line on April 30th.  And I want the fence line in the top of pasture one to move down to the bottom of pasture  two at XYZ time.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:14:16):**  You have the ability to make fences active movement zones where, where it's no longer  a static asset.  You're able to take that and make it dynamic.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:14:29):**  And you can do that across your, your entire pasture, your entire property.  Now that means you can keep animals in an area.  You can keep animals out of an area and you always have the ability to identify where,  
**[0:14:42-0:14:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:14:42):**  where your animals are.  And then, so that that's, that's what the product does right now at the, at the visualization  layer, what the customer is able to do with that is they're able to say, where was pressure  
**[0:14:58-0:15:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:14:58):**  on my land?  So create a heat map that shows, okay, the last two weeks we had 500 head in this 200  acres, but they really only were putting pressure over here on this area, like create visualized  
**[0:15:18-0:15:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:15:18):**  pressure maps so that you know where your feed and forage exists over your landscape.  And then at the end of your year, you're able to say, look like, you know, we actually didn't  put pressure here.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:15:30):**  We've actually got a little bit of a feed bank over here, or we can raise this in this  different way.  You know, it's a, it's a tool to show what pressure looks like across your, across your  
**[0:15:38-0:15:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:15:38):**  landscape.  And then you can really start to take your imagination and let it run wild on what you  can do with that.  
**[0:15:47-0:16:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:15:47):**  Right.  So, you know, we've got an accelerometer in that device, you know, in the dairy space,  accelerometers have been used for years to detect estrus and health issues.  
**[0:16:02-0:16:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:16:02):**  So are you going to start being able to infield detect what animals are cycling?  Or at the very least be able to tell if they're, if they're eating, walking, drinking, resting  health, calving, what bull was on what cow, all of these things are, you know, starting  
**[0:16:22-0:16:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:16:22):**  to add precision to, you know, what right now is a little bit left to you, your assumption  based on just due to a lack of data.  So if you start having that traceable data, you start being able to draw these correlations  
**[0:16:37-0:16:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:16:37):**  between things.  A heat map of where my cattle have been grazing in the pasture would be like almost a dream  come true.  
**[0:16:45-0:17:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:16:45):**  You know, if I could have a heat map of where my cattle were grazing in the pasture and  say, okay, they've used that enough and then just draw a line and have that set to start  excluding him from that area and then you don't move the other end of the pasture a  
**[0:17:00-0:17:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:17:00):**  little ways down the canyon so they have some more grass.  Like, that's amazing.  It's also, Brian, it reminds me of Bob Kinford and like true migratory grazing because you're  
**[0:17:12-0:17:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:17:12):**  not, you're not restricted by physical fence line as to plan around your grazing season.  Right, right.  And so, you know, my brain is spinning like, you know, and again, I have so many questions  
**[0:17:30-0:17:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:17:30):**  like, so it's a sound cue.  Okay, and I think a lot of folks will back me up on this.  Okay, when I want to go out and I check, when I want to go out and I just want to look at  
**[0:17:42-0:17:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:17:42):**  my cows, I'll take my gator out and I can just go drive through them slowly and they  barely react to me being there.  When I want to move my cows, I also do that with my gator but, you know, I drive in different  
**[0:17:56-0:18:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:17:56):**  ways, you know, like to and from the gates and approach the herd in a different way to  get them up and get them moving.  But when I come in with the feed truck, they hear me like a quarter mile off, they hear  
**[0:18:10-0:18:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:18:10):**  me, they come running and they'll be waiting at the gate for me patiently like the good  girls they are.  So the question is, like, there's no doubt in my mind that training a cow with an audio  
**[0:18:26-0:18:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:18:26):**  signal on a collar works.  There's no doubt that works.  I just would have to see it.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:18:31):**  So like when they approach the barrier, it's just a beep, beep, beep, beep, beep that gets  louder or how does that work?  Yeah, I mean, so let me kind of take your question and answer it in two different fashions.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:18:44):**  Take as long as you need.  One is I'm going to describe where the product is today.  Okay.  
**[0:18:51-0:19:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:18:51):**  And I'm going to explain to you a little bit of like how we arrived there.  And then two, I'm going to extrapolate a little bit on what you said and where we think the  product could go.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:19:03):**  And so it's just Pavlovian training is what we're all describing.  Pavlov trained his dog that if you ring a bell, do they salivate?  And next thing you know, you take away the food and the dog's still salivating when it  
**[0:19:18-0:19:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:19:18):**  was ringing the bell.  So what we're doing is we have basically a sound zone that once an animal enters a zone,  it starts to hear a sound.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:19:31):**  And if that animal goes through that zone into another zone and it isn't turned away  or repelled from that zone, that sound is backed up via stimulus.  So you kind of have, if you can envision the world, it is a gray area and a red area.  
**[0:19:49-0:20:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:19:49):**  And in the gray area, when the animal's there, the animal's hearing sound.  That animal, if it goes into the red area, it's hearing sound and stimuli.  So it's continuing to marry those two things together.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:20:02):**  That's where the product is today.  The product has been built, we've been building for a couple of years to get product into  market as fast as possible so that we can learn.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:20:17):**  And we go to every producer that we talk to and customer and tell them, look, think about  the original iPod when it came out.  If you can remember that thing, it was like a little block.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:20:31):**  It held like a hundred songs in it.  And it was great.  Everybody was like, this thing is awesome.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:20:37):**  Yeah.  Compared to cassette tapes, they were pretty cool.  Pretty freaking cool.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:20:44):**  And yet now sound is such a by-product of your phone.  It's not even on your list of why you buy your smartphone.  It's just one of the many features that that thing provides you because it's so integral  
**[0:20:59-0:21:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:20:59):**  to how you operate your day-to-day life.  See where you're going.  So the product itself is at its iPod stage.  
**[0:21:11-0:21:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:21:11):**  And over time, we know exactly what you're saying to be true.  The single most predictable way to create any sort of animal behavior is actually via  positive reinforcement, not negative reinforcement.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:21:27):**  And that's just like natural biology.  Like you think about it, if the antelope always went to the right side when the lion came  at it, well, all the lions would just go to the right and they just kill all the antelopes.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:21:39):**  So the aversive behavior has to be somewhat unpredictable.  It has to go left, right, back, all over these different things.  Well, guess what?  
**[0:21:48-0:22:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:21:48):**  It's somewhat unpredictable right now if an animal is reacting to a sound that they need  a zone to help correct them to get out of it.  Eventually, you should be able to create a system that is saying, hey, this is negative  
**[0:22:05-0:22:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:22:05):**  and this is positive, go to positive.  But that takes a lot of time, a lot of animal behavioral analysis and understanding.  And so we are on our path to head there in a scenario where you're able to have a much  
**[0:22:20-0:22:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:22:20):**  more precision version of what we already have, which is infinitely more precise than  what exists in the market today.  But I think in the future, you're talking about a product that is not just having a  
**[0:22:31-0:22:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:22:31):**  negative zone, but has a positive zone.  So say, better feed is over here.  Go over here and you receive X.  
**[0:22:37-0:22:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:22:37):**  Okay, just to back up a little bit, a few moments ago, you mentioned after the audio  signal that it applies a stimulation.  So what kind of stimulation are we talking about?  
**[0:22:51-0:23:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:22:51):**  Yeah, I mean, the best analog is going to be a hot shot, but it's a lesser version of  a hot shot.  And I get that and I knew that's what it was.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:23:01):**  And I figured you didn't really want to say that because there might be some animal rights  activist that gets upset, but I mean, an incredibly mild shock is a very, very useful training  tool.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:23:12):**  I mean, look, we do a lot of research on the animal welfare side of things.  So we want to be crystal clear.  We're not cavalier at all about delivering any sort of stimulus to animals.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:23:26):**  The way, and I'll explain this to most people who are listening to this podcast, the way  in which a electric fence works right now is that that stimulus goes through your whole  body, through the animal's body and into the ground.  
**[0:23:45-0:24:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:23:45):**  Right.  So you feel that shock in your bones when you bump into a hot wire and it'll put you  on your backside pretty quick versus a hot shot is a point to point stimulus between  
**[0:24:02-0:24:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:24:02):**  those two prods, a existing electric fence depends on what you're managing, but you may  be between 3000 and 8000 volts that are running through that wire.  Yeah.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:24:15):**  Yeah.  I run mine a little bit hotter than that.  I was being conservative.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:24:18):**  I don't want anybody coming after you either, Brian.  Hey, hot fences keep cows in.  The hotter you can keep it and the faster that charger clicks, the less they're going  
**[0:24:31-0:24:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:24:31):**  to want to mess with it and try to be on the other side.  So other side, so they go into this gray zone, they start getting the beeps and then they  hit the red zone and the collar gives them a mild shock.  
**[0:24:45-0:24:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:24:45):**  What happens if it just takes off and keeps going?  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[0:24:50-0:25:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:24:50):**  So like, let me wrap up my last point just in terms of voltage there, just cause I'm  going to be, I'm going to be, I'm going to be nitpicking on you here, Brian.  So a, we run a typical, as I said, you know, hot wire will run three to three to 10, whatever  
**[0:25:08-0:25:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:25:08):**  you want, whatever you number, what you want it to be.  Yeah.  We're a sub a thousand volt, uh, you know, stimuli that is point to point.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:25:16):**  So, you know, and we've done actually a decent number of tests with some universities to  look at, um, the, the impact on cortisol levels.  Uh, and, and, and it showed that there's absolutely no change in terms of the stress level on,  
**[0:25:30-0:25:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:25:30):**  on, on cattle there.  And candidly, you know, we've had ranchers test it, you know, last week and was saying,  it's not as strong as a prod.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:25:39):**  We've had all members of the team.  My CK, I don't think has been initiated into it, but, uh, you know, we'll, we'll, we'll,  we'll get her on board at some point here.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:25:48):**  Uh, you know, like the taser at the police department.  Exactly.  Um, as trying it out.  
**[0:25:55-0:26:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:25:55):**  Um, and you know, I mean, it, it, it's, it's strong, it's a punch, but it's not something  that, uh, you know, is, is too dramatic.  Um, to answer your, your follow on question there though, one of the things that we patented  
**[0:26:10-0:26:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:26:10):**  as a company is this idea that the fence is a one way gate.  Right.  So you're, you're putting, you know, think about the fence and how we describe it a lot  
**[0:26:20-0:26:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:26:20):**  internally is it's a pressure tool and you're simply putting pressure to keep those animals  in an area.  If there's an opposing pressure that is greater than the pressure that the fence has got that  
**[0:26:32-0:26:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:26:32):**  cow's busting through it, that bull's busting through it.  You know, nothing's going to stop that, that animal from getting through, um, in, in some  cases and yet once it gets through, it suddenly goes into tracking mode.  
**[0:26:47-0:27:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:26:47):**  So that animal's it's GPS is still working.  It's still sending a signal saying, you know, this is where your cow is, except, you know,  what is happening now is, is that, you know, it's no longer receiving any sound, no longer  
**[0:27:01-0:27:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:27:01):**  receiving any stimulus.  It's just being tracked.  And so the one way gate theory is that the opposing pressure on that cow is now to come  
**[0:27:14-0:27:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:27:14):**  back in and rejoin the herd because it's natural herding behavior is to join the safety of  the herd.  So say that cow blows through the line because it's calf is over there or that bull blows  
**[0:27:27-0:27:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:27:27):**  through a line because it wants to go chase a cow bull is going to be a different example  because it's a bit of a loan, a loan or anyways, but like, you know, that the cow blowing through  is a different one.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:27:39):**  It's naturally going to come back in is recaptured.  It doesn't hear any stimulus, it doesn't feel any stimulus as it comes back through that  line.  
**[0:27:48-0:28:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:27:48):**  And then all of a sudden, it's re herded and re and re controlled via via its collar.  Okay.  So would the would the system give you an alert if you had a cow outside if you had  
**[0:28:01-0:28:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:28:01):**  animals outside your boundaries, or if you had animals outside where they were supposed  to be?  We've got that up.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:28:07):**  You can set up alerts.  It's it's been something that people think that they want more than they do, right.  I know, I'm honestly thinking about it, because I've got about six miles of highway that cut  
**[0:28:23-0:28:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:28:23):**  through the ranch.  Yeah.  And that's a lot of fence to worry about.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:28:27):**  And, you know, it'd be really nice to know immediately when I have a cow get out on the  highway versus waiting for a neighbor to call the sheriff to call in the middle of the night.  Yeah.  
**[0:28:39-0:29:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:28:39):**  So you can and you can initiate alerts for a lot of things.  And the reality that we find for most people who don't have highways running through the  ranch is that that natural herding behavior of that animal is going to take that alert  
**[0:29:02-0:29:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:29:02):**  and make it irrelevant by the time you get around to looking at it.  It blows through a fence line and can come back and rejoin the rest of the herd by the  time you've gotten around to looking at it.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:29:16):**  And so your case may be different and everybody's case may be different.  Again, it's simply it's a data stream to the ability to take that data stream and translate  it into an actionable insight for you.  
**[0:29:30-0:29:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:29:30):**  It's something that we're building our platform on and we continue to look at what are the  best ways we can do that.  You know, the cows on highway call, it doesn't matter where it comes from.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:29:45):**  It is an immediate and rapid response no matter what you're doing.  That's one of the few things that will get me to drop whatever I'm doing and go at warp  speed in one direction is cows on the highway.  
**[0:29:59-0:30:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:29:59):**  Even if they're not mine, like there's been several times, I'm not going to give any kind  of percentages here, but there's been several times where there's been cows on the highway  call and you all jump back in my clothes or drop whatever I'm doing, jump in the truck,  
**[0:30:14-0:30:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:30:14):**  drive out to the ranch and it's a neighbor's cow two miles down the road or it's somebody  else's cow that's come from four miles down the road and she's just got her bags packed  and headed to Fort Worth.  
**[0:30:26-0:30:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:30:26):**  It's been that a couple times, but there's been a couple times where it's also been mine.  It would really be nice to know the difference before I go screaming out of here at 90 miles  an hour.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:30:37):**  Yeah, I mean, I think that the, so one, we would take caution in selling the product  to you.  Just because if you think about it from my perspective, like I know that we're creating  
**[0:30:55-0:31:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:30:55):**  a pressure tool and that that pressure tool is not infallible, right?  It's not a sixth wire fence or a steel gate that is guaranteed to keep cattle out of one  area.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:31:11):**  It is a pressure tool and if there's an opposing pressure, cows will push and push through  it and so my concern would immediately be, okay, am I going to wake up one day and find  out that there was an accident at Brian's Ranch because some family hit a cow that blew  
**[0:31:28-0:31:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:31:28):**  through because of our system?  No, because I'll still have to maintain a five wire fence around the place.  I mean, I'm never going to tear out the fence system.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:31:39):**  Well, okay, let's not say never.  I don't have any current plans to even entertain the notion of tearing out the fences down  the highway and applying for an open range permit.  
**[0:31:52-0:32:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:31:52):**  That's not part of my plan.  Yeah, I mean, so again, this would just be our discussion because I would say, okay,  cool, like how maintained is that?  
**[0:32:02-0:32:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:32:02):**  Because I mean, we don't want to do any harm, right?  And we understand that our tool is not infallible, right?  It is a pressure tool and cows can blow through it, so it is feasible.  
**[0:32:19-0:32:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:32:19):**  I've explained things several times to other folks about pressure by using like the term  units of pressure, like that fence can represent 100 units of pressure.  And that cow could have 90 units of stress.  
**[0:32:35-0:32:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:32:35):**  And you walk into that pen with 15 units of stress, she's going to want to go through  that fence, especially if you're standing in the middle of that gate, but you move out  of that gate, that 90 stress cow that's surrounded by 100 stress fence sees that hole, that's  
**[0:32:50-0:33:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:32:50):**  where she's going to go.  And similarly, I was having a conversation with somebody very recently about their Coriannae's  that would just jump the hot wire and leave.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:33:06):**  Like okay, well, let's talk about this for a second.  How hot's your fence?  We discussed the fence for a minute.  
**[0:33:11-0:33:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:33:11):**  We discussed the charger, how fast it would fire.  Okay, what are they going to eat?  Oh, well, they just run over there by the pile of irrigation pipe and they eat the kochia.  
**[0:33:24-0:33:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:33:24):**  Well there you go.  Like go get some of the kochia, send it off for testing, see what it's really rich in  and then adjust your supplement program.  
**[0:33:33-0:33:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:33:33):**  They're going over there because they want that.  They need that and that represents another kind of pressure, like that's a nutritional  pressure that they really want.  
**[0:33:42-0:33:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:33:42):**  Yep.  Yeah.  I mean, I think that like you're speaking my language here because our view over time  
**[0:33:53-0:34:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:33:53):**  as we understand more on an animal level, like what their reaction is to the pressure,  to the pressure that we can deliver.  Think about us as being a sensor company and we're simply able to deliver a certain level  
**[0:34:12-0:34:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:34:12):**  of average pressure and determine an animal reaction to it.  We will never be able to fully understand the three-dimensional pressures that exist  on that animal in its landscape.  
**[0:34:28-0:34:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:34:28):**  It's like an interesting point that like sometimes comes up as a point of contention where people  are like, look, you guys are trying to take away the cowboys.  You're quite the opposite.  
**[0:34:38-0:34:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:34:38):**  There is never going to be a way that we as a technology company fully understand exactly  what you just described, that there's a pressure over by an irrigation pipe that is drawing  those animals.  
**[0:34:51-0:34:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:34:51):**  We can't see that.  We don't have the ability to get on the ground and identify what that opposing pressure is  and understand the solutions.  
**[0:34:59-0:35:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:34:59):**  All I can do is tell you, hey, we're not able to keep these animals in with this level of  pressure anymore.  Something else over there is pushing the other way.  
**[0:35:09-0:35:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:35:09):**  Moreover, we should be a tool that translates the job, whether it's looking to see what  the opposing pressure is or whether it's looking to see, oh, what the intervention may be that  you can target for a specific animal is having more value to the ranch and the rancher.  
**[0:35:31-0:35:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:35:31):**  If I'm able to say to you, look, 20% of your cows are empty in July and this bull is over  here sitting under the water the whole time or this bull has been on them and they've  been cycling, you've got an idea of how to intervene.  
**[0:35:49-0:36:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:35:49):**  Or something like this bull has been on top of 75 cows in the last three days and these  other two idiots have been in the far corner of the pasture looking over the fence doing  nothing.  
**[0:36:00-0:36:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:36:00):**  Like you suddenly have the ability, we're not going to be able to take that data and  remotely fully understand that.  That's something that the cowboy and the rancher is always going to need to be the boots on  
**[0:36:14-0:36:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:36:14):**  the ground that is taking an intervention, taking that data and turning it into value.  We're simply a tool that again is sensing and putting pressure on animals to keep them  in certain areas.  
**[0:36:27-0:36:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:36:27):**  The definition of that tool is I think what our goal is to create more value to producers.  Okay.  Let's go back to the, let's talk about some of the hardware itself.  
**[0:36:39-0:36:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:36:39):**  We're talking about a collar.  We're talking about a collar, not just an ear tag.  You got to capture the animal, squeeze, shoot, head catch and put the collar on.  
**[0:36:50-0:36:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:36:50):**  How hard is it and how durable is it?  I guess is what I want to know.  Yeah.  
**[0:36:58-0:37:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:36:58):**  You're, you're asking about durability for my guests for two reasons or three or a couple  of different reasons.  How often do I have to bring them in to maintain collars?  
**[0:37:07-0:37:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:37:07):**  That's the question.  Yes.  And so, so one, you don't own the collars.  
**[0:37:13-0:37:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:37:13):**  We are, you know, as part of our service, we're providing you with the collars.  So if collar breaks, it's on us.  Okay.  
**[0:37:20-0:37:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:37:20):**  That's all.  You know?  And if a collar upgrade, you know, two years from now and we have a new collar, that's  
**[0:37:26-0:37:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:37:26):**  on us too, to get those new colors.  So that's like, you just send me the new ones and I send you the old ones.  Precisely.  
**[0:37:33-0:37:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:37:33):**  Okay.  Because our view is that most people understand there's going to be improvements in the hardware.  There's going to be improvements in the system.  
**[0:37:39-0:37:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:37:39):**  And so, um, we, we want to make sure that we alleviate concern as it relates to that  from, from a ranch or perspective.  Um, you know, so that they're not saying, oh, I'm going to go buy this piece of equipment  
**[0:37:49-0:38:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:37:49):**  and it's going to go bad in two years and you know, then I'm going to be sitting here  with this old piece of junk.  Um, you know, in terms of putting it on animals, like we've got a variety of, of, of examples  
**[0:38:03-0:38:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:38:03):**  of, of, of different speeds.  As you can imagine, different people have different animal handling skills, but, uh,  you put animals in a chute and you put the device on, it's going to take you 30 seconds  
**[0:38:15-0:38:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:38:15):**  to a minute.  Okay.  Um, the battery on that device is going to last you a range of time, depending on how  
**[0:38:29-0:38:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:38:29):**  you're managing your cattle.  And the reason for that is the number one use of battery is a GPS.  So think about an animal in the middle of a thousand acre pasture, its collar wakes  
**[0:38:45-0:38:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:38:45):**  up and says, where do I exist on the planet and where's the nearest fence line?  And it goes, oh, nearest fence line is half a mile over there.  Go to sleep for 20 minutes because this animal, this, this, we can get there, get there.  
**[0:38:59-0:39:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:38:59):**  No way we can get there fast enough.  If it wakes up and it goes, oh, I'm in a five acre pasture.  It goes, oh, go to sleep for five seconds and then wake up and see what, see where we  
**[0:39:11-0:39:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:39:11):**  are because we're pretty close to that fence line.  So you're using GPS a lot more frequently and you're burning that battery in a smaller  pasture than you are in the big pasture.  
**[0:39:23-0:39:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:39:23):**  And so in the smaller pasture, you are looking at a six to nine month battery life and a  larger pasture year, year, year, plus some areas in Northern Australia, we're talking  two years.  
**[0:39:35-0:39:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:39:35):**  Um, just depends on how close those animals are going to be to a fence line at any given  point in time.  So that's, then that's kind of a, that's a stock density function really is, is animals,  
**[0:39:50-0:40:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:39:50):**  animals, animals in an area over time.  So do you have an idea of what that looks like?  I think so when you say it's a stock density thing, uh, I think it's, it's a, it's a land  
**[0:40:08-0:40:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:40:08):**  productivity thing in some sense, right?  Where they're related, they're kissing cousins.  Right.  
**[0:40:16-0:40:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:40:16):**  Um, uh, so, um, you know, it, it, it really is going to depend on your landscape of what  that number looks like.  Again, like we use that range of like, Hey, it's six to nine months.  
**[0:40:28-0:40:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:40:28):**  If you're on the lower end here that you need to bring those animals in and swap out a battery  and you're on the upper end, it's going to look like this.  And then we've got a sensor that's basically saying, Hey Brian, two months from now, your  
**[0:40:43-0:40:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:40:43):**  batteries are going to run out.  Okay.  Hey Brian, a month from now, your batteries are going to run out.  
**[0:40:49-0:40:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:40:49):**  Hey Brian, you're a week out.  We're just going into tracking mode for an animal safety reasons and your battery is  going to run out in a week.  
**[0:40:59-0:41:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:40:59):**  And so you'll get that type of alert so that you know when that, when that needs to happen  and hopefully with enough precipitate, you know, uh, enough lead time that you know,  we're not throwing a complete wrench in your operation, you know, for, for you to be able  
**[0:41:14-0:41:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:41:14):**  to work those animals, those cattle.  Yeah.  And you know, the, I guess for me, what it would come down to is, you know, is it like  
**[0:41:21-0:41:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:41:21):**  a regular predictable interval?  Cause you know, you have to come past your corrals and you know, do things once or twice  a year, just about always.  
**[0:41:29-0:41:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:41:29):**  So you know, if you're doing that already, that's just a good time to, to do that collar  maintenance.  Yeah.  
**[0:41:37-0:41:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:41:37):**  I think like that's, that's how we've, we've, that's why we targeted really the lower end  being that six month period is that like between calving, branding and you know, winter feed  times and zone, like there's not really going to be more than a six month period that we  
**[0:41:58-0:42:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:41:58):**  see most people not running those animals, at least by a corral, uh, you know, between  call it March and October, uh, you know, rough order of magnitude.  Yeah.  
**[0:42:13-0:42:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:42:13):**  Mine'll probably make two trips in that time.  Yeah.  So, yeah.  
**[0:42:17-0:42:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:42:17):**  So, and then you get to decide, you know, we take a look at where things are in the  battery and we say, okay, cool.  Like you, you don't need it right now.  
**[0:42:25-0:42:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:42:25):**  Is it an expensive battery or can I just run down to the store and buy like a bucket full  of double A's?  We first started out with double A's.  
**[0:42:34-0:42:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:42:34):**  Um, and what we, um, you know, this has been, been the learning curve of, of the company.  Uh, you know, cattle exist in some of the most environmentally challenging spots on  the planet.  
**[0:42:48-0:43:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:42:48):**  Um, and so we will, in the same day have, uh, cows in Northern Montana that are, you  know, sitting at five below and we'll have cows that are sitting at 110 in Australia.  Um, and so we had to actually design a battery and choose a battery based on like something  
**[0:43:09-0:43:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:43:09):**  that was almost a military grade to be able to work and provide a consistent charge throughout  those elements.  Um, you know, everybody in, everybody in kind of the Northern Plains area knows what it's  
**[0:43:23-0:43:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:43:23):**  like, you know, when, when, when it's, uh, it's been really cold and they go try and  start their car if they haven't had a triple charger on it or, um, you know, some, something  to keep that battery warm.  
**[0:43:32-0:43:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:43:32):**  Um, and so we basically use a specific battery that, uh, that enables us to operate across  those, um, those ranges, that battery ends up costing about 10 bucks.  I guess that's not too bad.  
**[0:43:47-0:43:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:43:47):**  And that, you know, that's a consumable that the end user has to bear the cost of then?  Correct.  Yeah.  
**[0:43:55-0:44:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:43:55):**  Okay.  Interesting.  So I, I'm still trying to circle back and get an answer.  
**[0:44:04-0:44:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:44:04):**  Like if I wanted to make a lane, like a strip down through a pasture to move them from one  area to another, is that something that can be done?  Yeah.  
**[0:44:12-0:44:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:44:12):**  I mean, I think it would be the only question for us is, is how big is the lane that you're  wanting to, you're wanting to, to, to, to manage?  Like think about most people are, um, most people are deceived by how precise they think  
**[0:44:28-0:44:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:44:28):**  GPS is.  Um, it's because your phones triangulate your GPS right now.  Um, and also, you know, they hear about John Deere's tractors operating down to, you know,  
**[0:44:44-0:44:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:44:44):**  10, you know, half an inch of, of specificity, um, in terms of being able to run GPS.  That's really, really sensitive intent of that.  You really can't stuff inside of a collar that'll fit on a cap.  
**[0:44:56-0:45:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:44:56):**  It's like, it's, it's about, you know, that has, that has actually two other systems that  are on farm that are creating a triangulation to get that level of predictability and the  amount of battery that that pulls.  
**[0:45:10-0:45:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:45:10):**  Um, and the GPS antenna, you know, all of those things, the solution combined is something  which would blow out the margins on, on any product that we could offer.  Right.  
**[0:45:21-0:45:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:45:21):**  And, and, and so will we get better?  Will GPS antennas get better?  Will all of these things get better over time?  
**[0:45:27-0:45:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:45:27):**  Yes.  We use the best GPS out there that exists right now and antenna wise and, and product  wise, and it still has the ability to be 10, 15 feet off of where that, where that cow  
**[0:45:41-0:45:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:45:41):**  is.  And, and so when you talk about running animals down a lane, you've got to think about, you  know, 500 foot wide lane, you know, mile long.  
**[0:45:54-0:45:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:45:54):**  Exactly.  That's fine.  Right.  
**[0:45:57-0:46:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:45:57):**  And when you're talking about a lane being something that's 20 feet wide, well, that's  different.  That's, that's, that's different.  
**[0:46:03-0:46:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:46:03):**  That's a different animal.  Uh, you know, and, um, you're, you're getting into this zone where GPS specificity is, it's  going to be really challenging.  
**[0:46:12-0:46:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:46:12):**  I think if you're, if you want to use a lane, that's a tighter area.  If you've got an existing physical fence, yeah, you can run a virtual fence somewhat  close to it.  
**[0:46:22-0:46:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:46:22):**  And then you're not dealing with two variable sides.  You're dealing with one really hard side and one side that's, that's, that's virtual.  I see.  
**[0:46:33-0:46:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:46:33):**  I see.  I'm wondering how, I'm wondering how they would be in like a high density strip grazing  type scenario.  
**[0:46:42-0:46:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:46:42):**  So imagine we have, we have a long skinny paddock, okay.  With water at one end and we want to start at the water and go towards the other end.  So, you know, every few hours that, you know, that GPS barrier could move, you know, south,  
**[0:46:58-0:47:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:46:58):**  or could it just maybe drift south so many feet every hour?  You would basically create a time-lapse fence move where the fence basically drops over  a period of time that you prescribe ahead of time, where you say, look, I want this,  
**[0:47:18-0:47:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:47:18):**  this animal, this, this fence line to, to move from here to here over this seven hours.  And it would slowly, the fence line would just drop over time and move in one direction.  Okay.  
**[0:47:33-0:47:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:47:33):**  So now let's get down to it.  So you said that I don't have to buy them.  So are we talking like, are we talking a lease type model or are we talking a subscription  
**[0:47:44-0:47:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:47:44):**  type model?  Subscription.  Okay.  
**[0:47:47-0:47:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:47:47):**  So sell me on that.  Sell you on that?  I think it sells itself.  
**[0:47:57-0:48:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:47:57):**  I mean, I think that the, you know, our view has been like, you don't want to buy a piece  of hardware that you know is going to be outdated in two years.  And so we're going to come to you and say, what do you think you can do with infinite  
**[0:48:12-0:48:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:48:12):**  fencing?  I can do a lot.  Yeah, a fencing and additional labor weren't a cost to you.  
**[0:48:21-0:48:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:48:21):**  What would you run?  I mean, in a lot of cases with creative management, you could probably double, double your stocking  rate with better management.  
**[0:48:35-0:48:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:48:35):**  So you got to add in water costs and like, you know, all this other fun stuff.  So you start to get, you know, if we were really starting to take the pencil to paper,  we'd, you know, we'd play with all those variables as well, but let's just simply say you add  
**[0:48:51-0:49:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:48:51):**  20% like to your average guy, who's going to believe that.  Like I think, I think you've got the ability mentally to go through a lot more creative  scenarios than, than most than what most ranchers are wanting to do.  
**[0:49:06-0:49:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:49:06):**  And, and so you started 20, a 20% increase, let's say you got 500 head out there.  You increase your carrying capacity by 20%.  Okay.  
**[0:49:20-0:49:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:49:20):**  100 head.  So now you're starting ranch.  Okay.  
**[0:49:23-0:49:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:49:23):**  So you got 600 there and the cost of doing that.  So we're, we're charging 35 bucks a year for, for, for the service.  And so, you know, you're at basically 20 K.  
**[0:49:38-0:49:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:49:38):**  So you've added a hundred head and the cost to do that is, you know, is 20 K plus your  cost of those animals.  Plus you, plus you, but you also have your, your animals that you're running, you're running  
**[0:49:55-0:50:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:49:55):**  now the rest of your herd via the system as well.  It's not just the hundred that you're gaining.  You're also gaining precision control of the rest.  
**[0:50:04-0:50:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:50:04):**  And then the, the other one, which we, that, you know, I'd say ties to that is, you know,  what's the nutritional gain.  What's what's the redo is there a reduction on feed costs at the back half of the year.  
**[0:50:16-0:50:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:50:16):**  And now that you know exactly where you've managed and you have, do you have feed banks  on your property?  You know, that's tied to the additional carrying capacity as well.  
**[0:50:24-0:50:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:50:24):**  So I don't want to double count, but I think that there's.  A lot of that also has to go back to management because it's one thing just to know where  they're at.  
**[0:50:35-0:50:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:50:35):**  It's another to be able to move them, but to be able to actually measure some of these  things is a little bit more difficult.  And I think it's probably worth saying that you're not looking for the guy that's got,  
**[0:50:47-0:50:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:50:47):**  you know, these big, huge pastures.  That's not really, no, let me, let me back up.  Let me back up.  
**[0:50:57-0:51:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:50:57):**  I mean, I guess you're, you're kind of applicable to about everybody from guys like me who,  you know, I'm already fairly well subdivided.  I can see a use case for this and say somebody that's got some deeded land in the mountains  
**[0:51:13-0:51:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:51:13):**  and a mountain lease.  Yeah, I think like our it's a tool, right.  And and so that tool has, has broad applicability.  
**[0:51:25-0:51:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:51:25):**  If you view it as simply a tool and, and, and, and ask what somebody wants to do with  it.  Right.  
**[0:51:31-0:51:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:51:31):**  And so in your scenario, we may be getting down into really high detail of precision  and you're trying some, some kind of new and different and more challenging scenarios in  a forest service lease that somebody is looking to manage.  
**[0:51:51-0:52:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:51:51):**  It may be keeping animals out of a burn area to keep, to keep your, to keep your agents  and to keep you being able to graze agents happy and keep you able to be grazing that  that lease after after a burn, for example, or you know, in the 1500 acre pasture side,  
**[0:52:09-0:52:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:52:09):**  maybe it's somebody wants to be a little bit more progressive and wants to subdivide.  They just don't, they don't have the labor and the management to do it at this, at this  point in time.  
**[0:52:18-0:52:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:52:18):**  I think it's a tool that allows for adaptability and for really more precision management of  your herd without the need for additional labor or infrastructure.  Okay.  
**[0:52:33-0:52:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:52:33):**  So I'd other one, like one detail comes to mind right now.  Like, so what happens if a collar falls off a cow?  I mean, obviously it's got a GPS in it so you can just go find it.  
**[0:52:46-0:52:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:52:46):**  But what happens if, what happens if a collar gets lost and it just can't be found?  How much like we have to pay the replacement cost.  Somebody's going to ask.  
**[0:52:56-0:53:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:52:56):**  Well, you don't own that.  I do.  Okay.  
**[0:53:01-0:53:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:53:01):**  So this, this, this, this kind of is part of why selling you on the, on the kind of  service level is this is, is like for me a more elegant version of where you go, Oh wait,  so if I lose it, if a collar gets lost, that just gets deducted from my cost this year,  
**[0:53:18-0:53:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:53:18):**  right?  It's not on me.  It's not on you at all.  
**[0:53:22-0:53:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:53:22):**  It's on vents as a company to make sure that you put on those collars.  Right.  And, and that, you know, they're all working, but if one comes off, that's on us, that's  
**[0:53:32-0:53:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:53:32):**  our issue now from a, from a product efficacy level, there's a question there right on your  end.  Like, look, this, this collar is off now.  
**[0:53:41-0:54:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:53:41):**  This, now this cow may be in the middle of the road and I don't know it.  What we believe and what we've seen is that even with, you know, a certain percentage  of, of collars off cattle or collars actually not actively managing cattle, the herd level  
**[0:54:01-0:54:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:54:01):**  efficacy and the herd level management still exists because you, you have this dynamic  where that's the positive pressure towards those animals.  It's sucking those other animals back into the, to the herd, even though they're not  
**[0:54:17-0:54:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:54:17):**  actively being managed.  Right.  Once they, once you get them in a herd and they establish kind of their, their dominance  
**[0:54:26-0:54:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:54:26):**  order, they like to stay there.  I mean, it's safety.  Yeah, for sure.  
**[0:54:34-0:54:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:54:34):**  Especially during calving season.  Yeah.  So what other, what other infrastructure do you have to install on the ranch besides just  
**[0:54:43-0:54:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:54:43):**  putting these collars on?  Because it can't be that easy just to, just, just to buckle the collar around their neck.  That's the end state, right?  
**[0:54:51-0:54:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:54:51):**  Like that's the elegant solution eventually is like being able to drop ship you a collar  and like slap it on it.  You don't have to do anything else.  
**[0:54:57-0:55:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:54:57):**  Like right now.  Ideally it'd be an ear tag, something even simpler and smaller.  I know you and everybody else wants an ear tag.  
**[0:55:09-0:55:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:55:09):**  Ears are a lot easier to get ahold of and tag than get ahold of one of these, you know,  things with two foot of spear on either side of her head and get a collar around her neck.  I hear ya.  
**[0:55:19-0:55:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:55:19):**  I hear ya.  The we also install these, what are, what we call base stations.  So it's a communications tower.  
**[0:55:29-0:55:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:55:29):**  It's about, it looks, it literally looks like a metal duck blind.  You know, it's about five feet tall, four or five feet wide, two or three feet deep  and has a small antenna that runs up the side of it.  
**[0:55:45-0:56:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:55:45):**  And we installed depending on the size of the ranch, one, two, three of them.  And they will cover potentially, you know, tens of thousands of acres piece.  Just depends on what the topology of the ranch looks like.  
**[0:56:02-0:56:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:56:02):**  And those provide, you know, if you think about us thinking about this as a solution  for, it's gotta be cost justified for, for our customer to begin with.  It's it's like, Hey, instead of having to pay for communications to each of those collars  
**[0:56:18-0:56:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:56:18):**  every year, we're going to take a lump sum and put it into this one aggregation center.  And that's, they're going to pay that.  And then every year going forward, they're not paying for, you know, kind of connectivity  
**[0:56:31-0:56:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:56:31):**  charges for, for each of those collars.  Because they don't need as much, they don't need a lot of bandwidth.  These don't need 4g.  
**[0:56:39-0:56:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:56:39):**  Because you're basically, you're just sending up, you know, a heartbeat, you know, here  I am, here I am here.  Like our teams, I would say bread and butter strength has been building low power wide  
**[0:56:55-0:57:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:56:55):**  area communications networks.  And if you think about like what this is, it's really an application that sits on a  communications network.  
**[0:57:04-0:57:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:57:04):**  Yes, the application is animal management.  But really, the backbone of that is communications.  And so we have built a system that works really well and really cost effectively in these  
**[0:57:18-0:57:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:57:18):**  pretty challenging communications environments, you know, whether it's the Rocky Mountains,  whether it's, you know, areas that have no significant levels of connectivity, we can  create a network over a farm pretty inexpensively.  
**[0:57:32-0:57:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:57:32):**  Okay, so how do your communication nodes, your relays, how do they connect to the world?  So that base station either has cellular, you can use satellite, you know, 99% of the  people that we work with use cellular.  
**[0:57:52-0:58:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:57:52):**  And everybody goes, Oh, I live in this area, it's really tough to get cellular, there's  almost none.  Most of the time, if you can send a text from some hillside on your property, we can set  
**[0:58:05-0:58:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:58:05):**  up a tower there and it'll work.  Because you just you don't need near the bandwidth that Facebook or YouTube needs.  It's just super bandwidth efficient is how we've built the network because our belief  
**[0:58:18-0:58:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:58:18):**  is despite all this talk about rural broadband and all this different stuff that there's  not going to be 4G blasted across the entire United States.  Yeah, much less 5G.  
**[0:58:35-0:58:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:58:35):**  Yeah, because AT&T is not going to pay for it because there's not enough customers to  link into it is the real answer.  I have pretty good 4G coverage here and on the ranch, unless I'm down to some of those,  
**[0:58:47-0:59:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:58:47):**  you know, the bottom canyons and then good luck even getting out of there with a text  message sometime.  So what are some of the future plans and like features that you guys are looking at implementing?  
**[0:59:05-0:59:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:59:05):**  I mean, I think the biggest, like, so we made an announcement a couple weeks back that we  took on an investment from Shell Energy Ventures and from Merck Animal Health Ventures.  So I think it's probably worth kind of noting where, you know, how we see those feathering  
**[0:59:21-0:59:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:59:21):**  into the product.  I think, you know, Merck Animal Health is probably a little bit more intuitive in the  sense that they own AllFlex, right?  
**[0:59:31-0:59:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:59:31):**  And that they have, via the acquisition of AllFlex, they have a product called SCR, which  is on millions of head of dairy cattle globally and is basically one of the single largest  data platforms that is tracking health fertility of dairy cattle.  
**[0:59:54-1:00:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=0:59:54):**  And so, you know, we see there being this lot of interest from our side, you know, particularly  to understand how they built out that technology and kind of whether or not we can start to  integrate some of their learnings into having a system that has that same level of capability  
**[1:00:14-1:00:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:00:14):**  out on pasture.  You know, as we were talking about earlier, the ability to look at health metrics.  You've got, you know, 466 is walk 20% less day over day for the last three days in a  
**[1:00:29-1:00:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:00:29):**  row.  You know, something's wrong with…  Or the health monitoring algorithm detected a problem with her walking.  
**[1:00:38-1:00:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:00:38):**  Correct.  And so, starting to be having like precision animal level information in pasture.  Now, the follow up from that is how much can you actually intervene in certain faster scenarios.  
**[1:00:56-1:01:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:00:56):**  But if you start tracking it, you start getting these notifications across your herd, or if  you're driving out there, you certainly are going to take a look and say, like, you know,  I'm keeping an eye on it.  
**[1:01:06-1:01:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:01:06):**  You certainly, you start to have like a data source that is giving you things to look at  over your herd to track the health in a more, I would say specific fashion.  From the Shell side of things, I think it's a little bit further, more further afield,  
**[1:01:23-1:01:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:01:23):**  but it's everybody's heard discussions about carbon and, you know, selling carbon from  farms.  You know, if you think about Shell, they are obviously somebody who needs to have a significant  
**[1:01:37-1:01:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:01:37):**  amount of offsets, and they're looking at different solutions for those.  And with pasture lands being 39% of global arable lands, the ability to increase the  carbon sinking of those lands is something that is a pretty interesting proposition for  
**[1:01:58-1:02:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:01:58):**  a company of that size.  And so one of the things that they're looking at is saying, well, okay, why is it that there  aren't more grazing projects that are carbon grazing projects?  
**[1:02:13-1:02:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:02:13):**  And one is that it's hard, right?  It requires additional labor, requires the ability for people to be tracking the data  and taking it down with a level of precision.  
**[1:02:26-1:02:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:02:26):**  And then there's also the project development side of like, you know, actually creating  an offset and registering it.  It's hard to prove.  
**[1:02:35-1:02:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:02:35):**  There's nothing that says it's going to work, and it's going to take a while to get results.  And that's why all the big monies run away from it.  And so, like, you know, their view is that one of the things that's interesting about  
**[1:02:49-1:03:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:02:49):**  our product is, well, A, we have an enabling technology.  So it takes away the challenge on the rancher level of actually implementing a change in  practice, which is a requirement, right?  
**[1:03:05-1:03:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:03:05):**  Additionality is a requirement for any sort of carbon credit.  You have to have a change in practice, you know, to claim any sort of credit.  Otherwise you're just doing the same thing.  
**[1:03:15-1:03:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:03:15):**  Nothing's changed, and there's no kind of new additional generation occurring.  So A, we create a level of additionality for a carbon project.  B, you know, that enablement is also providing tracking of that action.  
**[1:03:37-1:03:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:03:37):**  So you are moving your animals, and that data is being logged about where you're moving  them and the frequency that you're moving them.  So suddenly you have two of the key kind of things that are needed to enable a carbon  
**[1:03:50-1:03:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:03:50):**  project.  The only things that you need to layer onto that are, you know, some level of soil testing  and, you know, to say, where do we start?  
**[1:03:59-1:04:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:03:59):**  Where do we end?  And who's going to buy it?  And so they represent a really interesting partner for us in that they have a lot of  
**[1:04:09-1:04:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:04:09):**  understanding of different methodologies for measurement and testing.  And they're working on constantly a variety of kind of improvements to what is out there  right now.  
**[1:04:24-1:04:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:04:24):**  And then they also represent a huge offtake partner.  So when we think about a future state of the world, future state of the product, I certainly  hope that we're able to go to a rancher and say, look, if you adopt vents, not only will  
**[1:04:37-1:04:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:04:37):**  we be able to have these natural, you know, improvements like we discussed where you're  increasing your carrying capacity by 20% or reducing your feed costs, but also, you know,  via the data that is generated via the adoption of those practices, here is a methodology  
**[1:04:55-1:05:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:04:55):**  that we will use and we will set, we can sell those, those credits direct through our platform  to somebody like a Shell.  How far off are you from your carbon marketplace on your platform?  
**[1:05:10-1:05:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:05:10):**  Yeah, it's a tough question.  Tougher than you might imagine.  Is it something that we could look for like this year or is it still down there?  
**[1:05:22-1:05:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:05:22):**  Yeah.  So, I mean, I think that like I view our carbon offering as being something that's going to  have an evolution phase as well, where we're going to offer one version of it now and that  
**[1:05:35-1:05:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:05:35):**  will continue to improve and evolve over time.  But I think we should certainly, over the course of this year, you should expect to  see us announce a couple of different projects that we're running with folks and at least,  
**[1:05:52-1:06:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:05:52):**  you know, mapping out what the future of that business is going to look like.  Okay.  Now, I got to ask, because in light of everything that's gone on in the world in the last two  
**[1:06:01-1:06:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:06:01):**  years, how are your supply chains?  We got absolutely hammered last year in March of last year with a couple of like simple  chips that we thought we'd done a pretty bang up job of getting around some of the supply  
**[1:06:28-1:06:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:06:28):**  chain challenges and there were a couple of chips that just got stopped manufacturing.  And so over the course of the year, we had some pretty decent insight that this year  was going to be a big year for us.  
**[1:06:42-1:06:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:06:42):**  So what we did is we went out into the marketplace and started buying up supply of what, you  know, not even newly manufactured chips, but like of existing chips that we could find  on kind of gray markets and black markets.  
**[1:06:57-1:07:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:06:57):**  And so we pre-purchased all of our challenging components for the year before the beginning  of this year.  And we're starting to do that for next year already so that we're not in this place of  
**[1:07:13-1:07:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:07:13):**  being in a last minute squeeze where suddenly we don't have access to it.  With that being said, like Shanghai shut down for like three weeks as of last week or something.  And that's going to have ripples for the next six months.  
**[1:07:33-1:07:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:07:33):**  Yeah, like Shanghai is biggest metals manufacturing province, right?  So think about your last year, it was chips in your trucks that you couldn't get.  Next year, it's going to be the steel frame to the truck that you can't get access to.  
**[1:07:51-1:08:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:07:51):**  It's like, you know, these things, we're constantly in a state of, okay, where will this ripple?  We feel like we've got a pretty good handle on it and we candidly spent a decent amount  of money trying to get out ahead of it because we understand that customers are pretty tired  
**[1:08:11-1:08:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:08:11):**  of hearing about it.  Everybody's like, okay, you had a year to make excuses.  Now I just want my damn collar.  
**[1:08:24-1:08:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:08:24):**  It seems like every day there's something new that's in short supply or something else  that you can't get a hold of at the farm store or something, another part of the grocery  store that's empty or something else has jumped in price 50%.  
**[1:08:42-1:08:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:08:42):**  It's a very interesting time to be living in.  We're getting close.  You said you had to go here in just a few minutes, yeah?  
**[1:08:49-1:08:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:08:49):**  Yeah, we've got about 10.  I'm good for another 10 here.  Okay, so let's take us home.  
**[1:08:55-1:09:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:08:55):**  Tell us where we can find you and why we'd want to.  Why you'd want to.  Look, I think that we're pretty clear.  
**[1:09:08-1:09:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:09:08):**  We want to create value for our customers.  And so if somebody can't see value in what we're doing, then they shouldn't be looking  for us.  
**[1:09:16-1:09:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:09:16):**  If somebody thinks that they can gain value from their land by having a more precision  way to manage their cattle and manage that landscape, you can find us at www.vence.io.  I think that that's applicable to most people.  
**[1:09:38-1:09:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:09:38):**  Some people may argue with me on that, but we think that this is simply a tool and that  our goal is to help our customer base gain more out of their landscape.  If they're not making more money out of the product, then we don't have a business.  
**[1:09:55-1:10:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:09:55):**  So that's why they should come find us if they think they can make more money and we'd  be glad to work with them and partner with them to help them find ways that they're going  to make more money and get more out of their ranch.  
**[1:10:07-1:10:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:10:07):**  Perfect.  Any social media that people should look out for?  Yeah, so I think it's not necessarily my skill set.  
**[1:10:16-1:10:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:10:16):**  I know that you're a lot better at this than I am, Brian.  Don't cuss me out like that, Frank.  I think we're on Instagram, we've got a Facebook page, we've got LinkedIn.  
**[1:10:30-1:10:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:10:30):**  We're not quite TikTok savvy yet, Brian.  So I know we got to get there.  I just want to make people mad on TikTok.  
**[1:10:44-1:10:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:10:44):**  As a company, we've probably under-invested to date in our presence and we're aware of  that.  Our mantra has been overdeliver and under-promise.  
**[1:10:59-1:11:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:10:59):**  We haven't tried too hard to get out there and talk too much about what we're doing until  we felt like we had a product that was robust enough to get out and really talk about.  We finally feel like we're in the space to do that.  
**[1:11:12-1:11:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:11:12):**  So I think you should see more of us on all those platforms and channels over the course  of the next year.  We're still learning and so we're the first to say that.  
**[1:11:25-1:11:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:11:25):**  But we feel like we got a pretty strong offering for people who are looking to make some changes  and find different ways to adapt their property.  That all sounds great.  
**[1:11:35-1:11:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:11:35):**  Frank, I really appreciate you joining us today and I won't keep you any longer unless  you go pick up your kids.  Thanks, man.  
**[1:11:43-1:11:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:11:43):**  I appreciate it.  Let me know where to ship the collars, Brian.  Will do.  
**[1:11:48-1:11:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:11:48):**  Will do, sir.  Hey, CK, are you still there?  Hey, Brian.  
**[1:11:53-1:12:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:11:53):**  Been a little quiet over there.  As a matter of fact, kind of been a little quiet the last few episodes.  So where have you been?  
**[1:12:03-1:12:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:12:03):**  Yeah.  So surprise, I got a new job.  And so it's been taking a lot of my time and I've been trying to figure out how do I get  
**[1:12:11-1:12:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:12:11):**  back to committing more time with this podcast.  And so been with Vince, I switched teams from passion map to Vince and the grassroots carbon  events.  
**[1:12:22-1:12:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:12:22):**  And so that's what I've been doing is learning how the heck does this company operate?  I don't think, well, that's not even something that Frank and I got into just a little bit  ago.  
**[1:12:35-1:12:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:12:35):**  Yeah.  So what did let's talk about what do you do at Vince?  Now that you've been there for a little bit, you're kind of up to speed.  
**[1:12:44-1:12:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:12:44):**  Yeah.  So I am basically, I am the person as soon as a ranch gets the hardware component on  collars, collars on cattle, and they're ready to use the software.  
**[1:12:57-1:13:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:12:57):**  So very much almost like soft pasture map is it's a map based software that I teach  them to operate the collars off of so that they can plant their grazing.  So that's, I'm doing customer success or support with the ranchers and I'm kind of building  
**[1:13:10-1:13:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:13:10):**  out that whole department for the company since we're so new.  That's really been my goal for the past, I think few months now.  Yeah.  
**[1:13:21-1:13:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:13:21):**  Well, I had to go back to the vault.  So next week, if everything goes well, the episode I'm going to run is going to be with  Daniel Mushrush.  
**[1:13:33-1:13:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:13:33):**  And I think you're under the weather when, when Daniel and I did that one.  Yeah.  A hundred two degree fever.  
**[1:13:39-1:13:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:13:39):**  So this crap that everyone has, I also got two, but yeah, Daniel, did he talk about Vince?  Yes.  Yes.  
**[1:13:46-1:13:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:13:46):**  He'd only had his collars for a few days.  Yes.  Less than a week.  
**[1:13:50-1:13:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:13:50):**  So he was just kind of getting into it and getting excited.  I'm really looking forward to circling back with Daniel in about six months.  And he's got it.  
**[1:13:57-1:14:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:13:57):**  Me too.  Cause they're actually getting, they're actually getting in a lot faster than some of my other  ranchers, which is everyone goes with their own space, right.  
**[1:14:06-1:14:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:14:06):**  But he's funny.  He was actually shoot side, shoot side, sorry.  FaceTimed me.  
**[1:14:12-1:14:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:14:12):**  And I was like, why the hell is Daniel Mushrush FaceTiming me?  But I answered it being the curious person that I am.  And he's sitting there with his cow.  
**[1:14:20-1:14:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:14:20):**  He's like, is this tight enough?  I saw he'd posted something on Facebook that they had to go play cowboy and get cows back  where they're supposed to be.  
**[1:14:34-1:14:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:14:34):**  And there were some cows that were wearing some collars and I really wanted to ask him  what was going on with that.  But I imagine with everything, you know, there's a learning curve, both with the animals and  
**[1:14:44-1:14:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:14:44):**  with the people that operate the technology.  So it'll be interesting to hear his lessons in another few months.  And I'm kind of excited to, you know, maybe get in the line to get some of those myself.  
**[1:14:54-1:15:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:14:54):**  Yes.  We're trying to get you some collars or brain.  So we're trying to get them sent to you.  
**[1:15:00-1:15:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:15:00):**  We'll work on that.  So what else is new?  Living my best life in Idaho still.  
**[1:15:10-1:15:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:15:10):**  Finally finished renovating the little farmhouse that we have and just putting in a garden.  So that's been really fun to actually have a garden.  I've moved so many times that I've never been able to spend a whole summer and harvest anywhere.  
**[1:15:25-1:15:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:15:25):**  And so I'm like, finally, I can actually have a garden.  And you know what happened?  Fucking rockchucks ate all my cabbages that were looking beautiful.  
**[1:15:36-1:15:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:15:36):**  Like numbed them down to ground zero.  Yeah.  Rockchuck, that's some sort of ground dwelling rodent.  
**[1:15:43-1:15:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:15:43):**  It's a yellow-bellied marmot.  Yes.  Yellow-bellied marmot.  
**[1:15:48-1:15:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:15:48):**  If you would have just said that, I would have kind of known what it was.  Oh, okay.  Rockchucks, that's how I know them.  
**[1:15:54-1:15:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:15:54):**  I mean, it could have been a bird.  I don't know.  Yeah.  
**[1:15:58-1:16:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:15:58):**  So you know, it's funny because I told Joel he couldn't kill any, my husband.  And I was like, no, they have an ecosystem service.  Like there's a reason that they're here.  
**[1:16:06-1:16:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:16:06):**  I was like, no, kill the fuckers.  Apparently they're here to eat your cabin.  Yes.  
**[1:16:11-1:16:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:16:11):**  I kind of felt the same way about coyotes until there was one in the yard and got four  chickens in one day.  Yeah.  
**[1:16:18-1:16:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:16:18):**  That's, we can't allow that.  That's just not going to happen anymore.  Yeah.  
**[1:16:22-1:16:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:16:22):**  And then I went on a little hunting spree and killed quite a few.  So there's still some out there.  So you know, whatever service they provide to the soil, they still are doing, there's  
**[1:16:31-1:16:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:16:31):**  just not 50 of them.  What else do you have planned?  So I'm going to be doing a coloring event in like Bozeman, Montana area later next week.  
**[1:16:43-1:16:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:16:43):**  And so I've just been traveling like last weekend.  I was in Coeur d'Alene, which is like eight hours north of Idaho where I'm from.  It's beautiful.  
**[1:16:54-1:17:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:16:54):**  It was green, the hills, the grasses there.  I was like, this must be like the only place in the US that's not in drought.  Yeah.  
**[1:17:03-1:17:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:17:03):**  I have a couple other people that I know, acquaintances that kind of live up in Northern  Idaho and one of them, she's always, she's been posting maps like of the, what is it?  Idaho snowpack.  
**[1:17:17-1:17:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:17:17):**  Yeah, maps so you guys could figure out what you have, what you're going to have for water.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[1:17:23-1:17:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:17:23):**  And it seemed like a couple of months ago, things looked a little bit grim and then all  of a sudden things started to look a lot better.  Yeah.  
**[1:17:33-1:17:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:17:33):**  We've gotten, even here in Southern Idaho, you know, it's a very arid climate.  We probably only get 11 inches of rain and 14 inches of snow during the winter.  The last month, I think we've gotten two or three inches of rain, which is crazy for June  
**[1:17:50-1:17:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:17:50):**  and end of May.  Crazy.  It doesn't happen usually.  
**[1:17:56-1:18:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:17:56):**  We've gotten, we've actually gotten some moisture in the last couple of weeks.  It's quite a bit.  Like 99 inches?  
**[1:18:02-1:18:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:18:02):**  Is that what I heard?  How many?  Nine?  
**[1:18:05-1:18:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:18:05):**  No.  No.  No.  
**[1:18:08-1:18:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:18:08):**  I'm still looking at a potential de-stocking trigger, but we have another few days yet.  When we're recording this, when it comes out, it'll just be a couple of days to make that  call.  
**[1:18:21-1:18:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:18:21):**  But looking at the forecast, I think I might go ahead, need to go ahead and make another  trim.  Just make a slight trim for an adjustment.  
**[1:18:33-1:18:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:18:33):**  Just get a few more cows somewhere else to eat.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[1:18:38-1:18:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:18:38):**  So you're, you're soil sampling, right?  Last few weeks ago?  Yeah, it was a couple months ago.  
**[1:18:44-1:18:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:18:44):**  I can't remember when.  I think it was April.  Yeah, it was in April.  
**[1:18:48-1:18:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:18:48):**  Okay.  Maybe towards the end of April.  Okay.  
**[1:18:52-1:18:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:18:52):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  I still haven't heard any back from.  
**[1:18:57-1:19:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:18:57):**  Hopefully we'll, we'll hear back soon from about the results from those samples.  Send you some money.  Eventually.  
**[1:19:03-1:19:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:19:03):**  That's the goal, right?  Absolutely.  Yeah.  
**[1:19:06-1:19:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:19:06):**  So, you know, part of Vences and we've released an announcement is we've actually partnered  with Shell Ventures.  So that's the carbon side of what we might do with the collars.  
**[1:19:18-1:19:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:19:18):**  And then we also partnered with Merck Animal Health and I'm really excited about the Merck  deal because they're going to put in like an RFID into the collars.  And so I think there's going to be a lot of capabilities for wand readers at the shoot  
**[1:19:33-1:19:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:19:33):**  and just tracking really good health analytics as far as whatever we decide we want to try.  So that's, that'd be something to be coming in a future collar with more.  Yeah.  
**[1:19:48-1:19:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:19:48):**  Is improved health monitoring?  Yeah.  I don't know exactly what we've done, if we've made any decisions, but I know that Merck  
**[1:19:53-1:20:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:19:53):**  Animal Health is really excited about the potentials that we can do since we're, we  very much still have an R&D department to figure out what they would need for that partnership.  Can you tell me maybe what are any of the first things you're looking at?  
**[1:20:09-1:20:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:20:09):**  Well, I think one nice thing is like the collar can read temperature, but it's not very accurate  because the collar hangs off.  Right.  
**[1:20:19-1:20:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:20:19):**  And then also that has a pedometer.  And so I think that's just really interesting for like estrus detection in like an animal  that's maybe slowing down compared to the others is a sign of sickness.  
**[1:20:32-1:20:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:20:32):**  And I think even like when I was in college, we had a grow safe bunk system and that would  measure every animal's bite of feed that they took.  And so you would know if something's getting off feed sooner than what you would find as  
**[1:20:46-1:20:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:20:46):**  a visual cue when you're checking animals.  So it would kind of give us these indicator warnings of, Hey, this animal needs to go  with that because it might be sick and you just don't see any clinical signs yet.  
**[1:20:57-1:21:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:20:57):**  You said there's a pedometer function in the collar.  I'm wondering if like, if there's a way to be able to like to teach that pedometer or  yeah, how am I trying to say this?  
**[1:21:11-1:21:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:21:11):**  To be able to tell if the cow's walking funny or not.  Like over, like you should know roughly the gait of a healthy cow.  Yes.  
**[1:21:20-1:21:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:21:20):**  And then, you know, if a cow has foot rot on a quarter, like that should, that should  like have a unique walking signature.  Yep.  
**[1:21:29-1:21:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:21:29):**  I think, I think that's one of the things we have a data scientist who's going to be  looking into that.  And then I also think figuring out when the cows are sleeping so you can conserve battery  
**[1:21:39-1:21:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:21:39):**  life is another thing.  Until we have a rechargeable battery, that's either solar powered or actually make it made  a joke about, you know what a linear, linear alternator is?  
**[1:21:52-1:22:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:21:52):**  Yes.  I think that'd be cool to have these in the collar and like you could do that with a pedometer,  don't you think?  
**[1:22:01-1:22:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:22:01):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  Maybe I'm just, I'm trying to vision how that would go on a cow where you could get enough,  
**[1:22:08-1:22:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:22:08):**  yeah, enough, enough change in motion.  Energy is required.  Yeah.  
**[1:22:14-1:22:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:22:14):**  Yeah.  It's me being a nerd.  And so I, this is totally a new concept for me is the hardware component or mechanical  
**[1:22:22-1:22:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:22:22):**  engineering.  And I'm like, well, this is weird.  Like it's a new challenge of skillset that I'm learning that I never thought I would  
**[1:22:28-1:22:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:22:28):**  do.  No, no, here's what we do.  Now that we've got collars that'll go on them.  
**[1:22:33-1:22:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:22:33):**  Now we need to have backpacks.  And when you put this backpack on the cow and then it's got a little, little wind turbine  that folds up out of the backpack to generate power for the collar.  
**[1:22:44-1:22:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:22:44):**  Yeah, well, the collar senses they're running, it pops the windmill out, pull them down a  little bit and recover some energy.  Yeah.  
**[1:22:55-1:23:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:22:55):**  Cause that is one thing the collars do with the pedometer and with the GPS in the collar  is they kind of triangulate how close they are to an active pressure zone.  So how long does it take for a cow to walk from point A to B, which is the B is the pressure  
**[1:23:10-1:23:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:23:10):**  zone so that the collar turns on again to read where it's at.  And it's not wasting battery power when it's not here.  Exactly.  
**[1:23:19-1:23:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:23:19):**  We're trying to balance the two until we figured out the battery use case.  The thing I'm really excited about is being able to see a grazing heat map.  Yeah, that is cool.  
**[1:23:34-1:23:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:23:34):**  And I wonder how we could translate that, you know, to a snapshot the day before they  get turned in that pasture of what, you know, all the forage is like in that pasture.  And I don't know if it'd be possible to actually quantify that other than just going  
**[1:23:52-1:23:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:23:52):**  out looking and saying, all right, there's a lot of the yellow clover over here.  There's a lot of this over there.  There's a lot of that over there.  
**[1:23:58-1:24:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:23:58):**  And then turn them in and see what the heat map says, where they're actually at versus  where you think they've been all day.  Exactly.  
**[1:24:04-1:24:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:24:04):**  When I see, when I look at customers' heat maps, you can see what's not being utilized.  Very obviously you can see areas that are not being grazed.  Any patterns you've seen?  
**[1:24:16-1:24:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:24:16):**  I mean, if it's a challenging terrain, right, they pick the easier route.  So we have a lot of BLM and forestry allotments that are using vents.  It's actually really helpful because, you know, you can't build on public land or private  
**[1:24:35-1:24:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:24:35):**  public lands.  Yeah.  So you can't build it fence infrastructure and they really don't like you to cross fence.  
**[1:24:41-1:24:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:24:41):**  Right.  So it's good for them to have that peace of mind so that they know, okay, and they're  really not disturbing these, what is it called when they're young trees?  
**[1:24:52-1:24:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:24:52):**  They're called something juvenile trees or whatever, but saplings.  Saplings.  Yeah, that's the word.  
**[1:24:59-1:25:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:24:59):**  I almost said saplings, I don't know.  But as far as like forage, I do think that we have, there's a lot of potential for growth  in that area of actually having forage data and knowing, you know, what forages are they  
**[1:25:20-1:25:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:25:20):**  targeting first and leaving behind and why.  Yeah.  That's what I'd really like to know.  
**[1:25:27-1:25:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:25:27):**  You know, when I, the last several years since, you know, all these virtual fence technologies  have been in development, not just vents, it's always made a lot of sense that the use  case would be mountain grazing, like public lands grazing where you can't go out and cross  
**[1:25:46-1:26:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:25:46):**  fence, but you want to get, but yet you still need to be able to better control your livestock.  You know, I know Glen Elzinga, they use what they call in herding, note to self, email  Glen to come on podcast.  
**[1:26:02-1:26:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:26:02):**  But then the alternative to that, the lower, you know, the low labor high technology option  would be collars, you know, collars, ear tags, whatever, whatever technology ends up being.  And I could see there's a really strong use case for that on public lands.  
**[1:26:18-1:26:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:26:18):**  Knowing where they've been, knowing where they've been, you know, knowing where they've  been grazing off the heat map and where they haven't.  And I think you could also get an understanding over time of how to use terrain as natural  
**[1:26:32-1:26:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:26:32):**  barriers to draw your computer generated fences on.  And that is something that we're already doing.  So like there's a four day training protocol once new collars go on new cattle.  
**[1:26:47-1:26:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:26:47):**  So the cattle don't understand what the behavior of the sound or the shock stimulus mean.  And so we like it to be to a hard fence so that they shy away from something that they  see.  
**[1:26:58-1:27:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:26:58):**  But if potentially there's no hard fence to train off of, we do a natural landscape barrier.  So like a downhill slope or like brush area that they want to stay out of or a rocky area  that they don't want to get into.  
**[1:27:13-1:27:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:27:13):**  Okay, cool stuff.  Cool stuff.  When am I going to get to see you again?  
**[1:27:25-1:27:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:27:25):**  I don't know when I'm traveling to Kansas.  Are you coming this way?  I don't know.  
**[1:27:32-1:27:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:27:32):**  There's our CAF's convention in Deadwood, South Dakota.  I know some of our teammates are going to that.  I'm thinking about it.  
**[1:27:41-1:27:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:27:41):**  I'm thinking about it.  First I checked if I wanted to fly out of Wichita, it was kind of high.  But if I flew out of Dodge City, it was half the price.  
**[1:27:54-1:27:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:27:54):**  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Explain that one to me.  
**[1:27:58-1:28:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:27:58):**  I don't know.  I don't know.  Yeah.  
**[1:28:03-1:28:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:28:03):**  But it's a little over 12 hours with, you know, $4 plus gasoline or $5 diesel.  Yes.  We drove through Oregon and it was $5.45 a gallon.  
**[1:28:15-1:28:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:28:15):**  I was like, what?  I was like, can we just drive to Idaho State line and get gas?  And he's like, we can afford this.  
**[1:28:22-1:28:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:28:22):**  I was like, I don't want to.  I just don't want to pay for this.  Yeah.  
**[1:28:27-1:28:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:28:27):**  Yeah.  Well, the first part of this we recorded a few weeks ago.  This part, by the time you all hear it on release day, it's just a couple days old and  
**[1:28:38-1:28:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:28:38):**  who knows what weirdness might be followed.  So we might be, you know, by the end of the week, we might be having fond memories of  gas at only $4.50 and diesel at only $5.50.  
**[1:28:50-1:29:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:28:50):**  Very strange times we're living in.  And I think it goes without saying that, you know, those questions we've been asking for  over a year, you know, how will high price diesel fuel affect your operation?  
**[1:29:05-1:29:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:29:05):**  No, it's doing it.  It's doing it.  It's doing it.  
**[1:29:10-1:29:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:29:10):**  You know, even the produce at the grocery store, I'm like, I don't want to pay for this.  Like why?  Yeah, it's a lot of things have changed.  
**[1:29:23-1:29:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:29:23):**  They're changing rapidly.  But some things, the more some things change, the more some things are going to remain the  same.  
**[1:29:30-1:29:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:29:30):**  You know, cows still want to eat, cows still need grass and sunshine.  Are you about ready to get out of here?  Yeah, I just wanted to just real quick is I felt like we were well, you're just at Grass

**[1:29:59-1:30:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:29:59):**  I think that was like, I just never expect that in any kind of ranching space.  And it's kind of kind of cool to experience that, to be honest.  So I just wanted to give that little shout out of gratitude.  
**[1:30:12-1:30:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:30:12):**  Yeah, and I really want to echo, I would echo that statement.  I don't want to steal any thunder from it because you get it more than I do.  And I'm like, oh, you know who I am?  
**[1:30:23-1:30:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:30:23):**  Like that's cool.  Yeah.  Well, I try not to get used to it.

**[1:30:47-1:30:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/68-Frank-Wooten-Future-Fencing-e1jqnna#t=1:30:47):**  of the red hills until either A, the moon comes down or the world calms down and things  get a little more reasonable.  Yeah, exactly.

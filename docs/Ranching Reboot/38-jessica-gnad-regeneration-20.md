Please welcome the brilliant and beautiful Jess Knaad from Mindblowing Chat about Regeneration  2.0.  
**[0:01:52-0:02:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:01:52):**  So Jess, Jess Knaad, welcome to the show.  How are you today?  Brian, it is a pleasure to be here.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:02:01):**  Thank you so much for having me on the podcast.  Well, it's great for you to be here.  I've known you for quite a few years.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:02:08):**  CK, you guys met, right?  No, we just met.  We just became pals.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:02:12):**  So when I was living in Manhattan, she invited me over for dinner and met her and her husband.  They met my husband and it was actually really nice to meet someone while I was in Manhattan  who understood regenetic.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:02:26):**  Not many people.  Kind of a shortage of those minds up there, right?  Oh, absolutely.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:02:32):**  Absolutely.  So it was really nice.  It was awesome because like you guys, your spouses are involved with certain aspects  
**[0:02:43-0:02:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:02:43):**  of agriculture.  It is so cool when you get another couple.  And I think we talked really late into the night.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:02:48):**  It was so much fun just to kind of have these conversations that aren't normal in a social  setting.  So it was really fantastic.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:02:57):**  Well, you know, it's kind of funny.  People talk about normal conversation in the social settings.  And the only conversations I want to have are cows and grass.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:03:08):**  Oh, absolutely.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:03:11):**  Oh, I feel the same way.  Brian, do you remember how we met?  I really don't.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:03:18):**  So I'm pulling a fast one on you.  This is how I remember getting introduced to you and your operation and your family.  It was when I was living just a little bit north of you, right outside the red hills  
**[0:03:31-0:03:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:03:31):**  in Pratt County, Kansas.  And we had this seven acre homestead that we were working on.  And I had posted a picture of our back pasture that had been severely overgrazed by donkeys.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:03:44):**  And I was asking about the removal of yucca and cactus.  And oh my gosh, between you and your dad, there was this huge tree line of cedars.  And that was my first introduction of like getting the cedars off of the grazing lands,  
**[0:03:58-0:04:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:03:58):**  the dangers of having these cedars.  And it wasn't long after that we had the big fire that swept through your place down there.  Right.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:04:07):**  I don't specifically remember that, but it sounds exactly like something I would do.  Look at a picture somebody posted and completely ignore the question that they asked and tell  them to get rid of their cedar trees.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:04:20):**  I had no idea.  And you were exactly right.  And then the aftermath of the fires, that's when we realized we needed to look at our  
**[0:04:28-0:04:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:04:28):**  property a little bit more holistically.  And like, how can we make sure that we're setting ourselves up to be protected from  this fire season?  
**[0:04:37-0:04:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:04:37):**  Well, you're doing a good job of setting yourself up to tell your story.  Because back then that was, if it was before the fire, that would have been like in the  2014-2015 timeframe.  
**[0:04:51-0:05:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:04:51):**  And you know, like six years ago, we didn't even have a term to, we didn't even have the  term regenerative agriculture.  So I guess walk us through the last six, seven years in the life of the Nadd family and where  
**[0:05:09-0:05:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:05:09):**  were you guys at and what were you doing back there when you were posting those pictures  wanting to know what to do about your yucca and how did you get to where you're at now?  Oh Lord, that's going to be a conversation.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:05:21):**  No, this is really great.  We've got all morning.  So context is totally key and I think that, you know, it's really important to talk about  
**[0:05:31-0:05:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:05:31):**  how each one of us comes to the story a little bit differently.  And I think that by telling our stories, we have the ability to have compassion for meeting  folks where they're at in their journey of solo health.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:05:44):**  And it's taken me 10 years to really think about and talk about this, you know, what  we're calling like this solo health journey.  And you're exactly right.  
**[0:05:52-0:06:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:05:52):**  We had no idea when we started this, that it was going to be regenerative, that we would  create careers and movements and all sorts of stuff out of it.  So to get to the beginning, I had the fortunate experience to fall in love with an agronomist  
**[0:06:09-0:06:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:06:09):**  and living in Kansas.  I mean, yeah, of course you're exposed to agriculture, but didn't grow up in a farming  family per se.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:06:16):**  So a lot of new things were coming my way when I married an agronomist.  And I think as a naturally curious person, the first question was, I couldn't figure  out why he wasn't home for dinner each night, you know, in the summertime.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:06:30):**  Like I was like, what, you know, what is it that you do?  I can't figure this out.  Like you just can't leave and come home for dinner.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:06:36):**  And so after a while, he, you know, he said, hop in the truck, let's go.  So I hopped in the truck and checked fields for a day, almost died, didn't actually die.  Like I thought I might die, but it was a completely wild experience of looking at the crops and  
**[0:06:56-0:07:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:06:56):**  trying to determine what was going on with the crops, checking for more moisture, pests,  weeds, you know, all the above.  It was just such a fascinating new world to me that I just, I needed to learn more.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:07:10):**  So from there, started the family, had a bunch of kids and knew that I was gonna stay home  with my kiddos.  And at that time we had this desire to become homesteaders, like based off of our experience  
**[0:07:24-0:07:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:07:24):**  with agronomy.  My husband's also a master gardener.  You know, I grew up in a family where we kept huge gardens.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:07:32):**  We really fed ourselves.  And that was actually because money was tight in the summer.  I didn't know that until, you know, I grew up older, but, but yeah, that was one reason  
**[0:07:43-0:07:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:07:43):**  why my parents had a big focus on backyard gardening is because it really provided for  the family in the lean months of the summer.  And yeah, so I had this desire to grow my own food.  
**[0:07:55-0:08:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:07:55):**  That's really where it started was I'm going to grow my own food.  And then that led me into this rabbit hole of learning about local food and learning  about local food in Kansas in particular.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:08:06):**  And I was shocked.  So we're not doing great producing our own food in Kansas.  Oh no, we're doing terrible.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:08:14):**  So CK, we kind of talked about that.  Yeah, it's, it truly is.  And in 2014, there's a fantastic report put out by the Kansas Rural Center called Feeding  
**[0:08:27-0:08:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:08:27):**  Kansas.  And they identified that the entire state of Kansas, of the acres that can be farmed,  you know, of all of the square miles of Kansas, 90% of that is for agricultural use.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:08:41):**  But Kansans 95% of what's on our plate does not get grown here in Kansas.  And, you know, I used to kind of sprinkle these statistics out over the years.  And then I would talk about economic development if we all ate local food, and I had statistics  
**[0:08:57-0:09:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:08:57):**  and I had, you know, I can talk about if everybody spent $5 a week, we could generate $750 billion  of new economic revenue for the state of Kansas, yada, yada, yada, you know, kind of fell on  dead ears.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:09:08):**  But guess what COVID hit, right?  So then all of these things that I was talking about, about food insecurity, about how breaks  in the supply chain, suddenly, they're front page news.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:09:22):**  Absolutely is front page news.  And, you know, Jessica Knob wasn't as good.  I'm still kind of nutty and crazy.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:09:27):**  But like, people were like, hey, what was that that we were talking about?  You know, that actually happened, didn't it?  I mean, in Manhattan, my kids school lunch program lost its food provider.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:09:38):**  So there was a week where the school didn't know how they were going to feed the kiddos.  So yeah, I mean, that was kind of a little rabbit hole there.  But it was really this desire to feed my kids to feed my husband.  
**[0:09:52-0:10:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:09:52):**  When you live out in a part of southeastern South, excuse me, South Central Kansas, there's  not restaurants for lunch, you know, there's gas station.  So I knew I needed to feed my husband really well, send him coolers of food, and I wanted  
**[0:10:04-0:10:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:10:04):**  to source that as locally as possible.  And I also had the fortunate experience to meet Curt and Andy Dale down in protection  because we were looking for meat products grown in a particular way.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:10:19):**  And I was an uneducated consumer.  I didn't know what I was looking for.  Right.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:10:23):**  So I saw this posting that Curt and Andy Dale had about their pastured meats.  So we did what we do.  We hop in the truck and we go look at it.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:10:31):**  That's what we do in Kansas.  You know, you got some time off.  Let's hop in the truck and go drive around.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:10:37):**  So we drove down there.  We actually ran into Curt and Andy.  They pulled us into their living room.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:10:42):**  You realize this.  We just like cold called showed up on these people's arm.  Right.  
**[0:10:47-0:11:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:10:47):**  And Curt handed us a book about Joel Salatin, about becoming a lunatic.  And in the back of my mind, I was like, I think I might be a little nutty.  And then I meet these people who think differently and act differently and are trying to do something  
**[0:11:02-0:11:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:11:02):**  differently.  And I did that just creates a bond with people.  So Curt and Andy Dale were our gateway drug into soil health and learning about growing  
**[0:11:13-0:11:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:11:13):**  food and producing food.  The Dales are some of my favorite people.  They're only about 35, 40 miles down the road.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:11:24):**  We get a lot of our meat from the Dales.  They're just absolutely wonderful people.  You guys still get them.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:11:30):**  Well, you're there in Manhattan.  You get Dale family farms all the way up there?  Absolutely.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:11:36):**  Absolutely.  So they deliver that we're on their delivery route.  And then I've gotten a number of my family members on the delivery route.  
**[0:11:43-0:12:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:11:43):**  My parents and this is what I'm kind of bouncing around, but talking about in the beginning,  I was an uneducated consumer and it took me a number of years to convince my parents to  seek out and spend a little bit more of their food budget on better quality meat, just the  
**[0:12:03-0:12:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:12:03):**  health benefits and talking about when this whole idea of voting with your dollars is  pretty obscure, I think still for consumers.  So my parents were doing really good buying the meat, but then we had to start talking  
**[0:12:17-0:12:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:12:17):**  about what happens when you go out to a restaurant, what are you supporting when you do that?  So yeah, because of all this education and 10 years of having them as influencers, I  hope that we've been able to bring more consumers into the fold about thinking about their food.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:12:32):**  And that was key for my husband and I, we understood really before we got into the soil  health agricultural part that food was our medicine and that I can determine the way  that I think and act and look based on what I put inside my body.  
**[0:12:50-0:13:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:12:50):**  So that was actually kind of the core for Mama Bear.  When I started thinking about health, it was through the lens of my kiddos, feeding my  husband, making sure that he could run our business that we ran down there in Pratt County.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:13:04):**  So from there, we started putting in large gardens, market gardens.  We really just kind of became obsessed with seeing what we could grow.  I was doing it all on a budget, so that led me to heirloom seeds and crops that would  
**[0:13:19-0:13:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:13:19):**  come back year after year.  And then I realized I needed to rotate my crops year after year.  I would watch these little tomatoes and peppers and squash and zucchini come up that were  
**[0:13:30-0:13:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:13:30):**  heirloom and I would have to watch them and then I'd transplant them to another area.  And so it became our own backyard experimentation center of figuring out how we were going to  grow food.  
**[0:13:42-0:14:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:13:42):**  And at first we did it chemical free, but we were very heavy tillage in our garden.  And we realized, I'll tell you what, getting the keys to that tiller, that backyard tiller  was a pretty big deal because my husband loved to till up the garden each year.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:14:04):**  It was a thing, the smell of it, the texture, getting out there.  It's a reset though, because we just moved here in Idaho too and we had a bunch of just  really ugly weed infested side pasture.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:14:17):**  And it is nice to just kind of have a reset, right?  But my brain is like yours too, is I know I shouldn't be doing this.  It's addicting.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:14:32):**  But what we did is, so we purchased much to my own sugar and we purchased a former donkey  ranch and we had, and it was overgrazed.  It was not managed properly, but we had all of this manure.  
**[0:14:48-0:15:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:14:48):**  So we did that first year reset where we scooped up the manure, we piled it, we rotate it.  We were taking temperature checks with the intent of building compost out of it.  And then year after year, as we tilled, we started to really suffer from compaction.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:15:07):**  And when I started to realize that the key to growing food was slow health, I had a very  good friend of mine come out and she tried to dig in my garden bed and she's like, girlfriend,  I don't know why you're talking about soil health.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:15:19):**  You have compacted soil.  She's like, look at this.  I can't even push my shovel, you know, my spade in your ground.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:15:27):**  What was causing that compaction layer?  I think it was repeated tillage passes up where we were working on.  We also weren't focusing on keeping our soil covered.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:15:39):**  So we were planting a garden with a conventional cropping system in mind.  And so we would have these perfect rows and we would mound them up.  There would be nothing growing.  
**[0:15:53-0:16:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:15:53):**  We would hoe the rows.  And so when I started introducing my husband to some more of these chaos methods, it was  way out of his comfort zone.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:16:05):**  I one time had to replant a row of onions because it wasn't like these perfect 90 degree  rows.  If you know my husband, like that's him.  
**[0:16:14-0:16:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:16:14):**  I'm more like all over the place and I like to be sporadic, but that's what it was from.  And then an infestation of squash bugs is what made us rethink our entire system of  farming in our backyard.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:16:32):**  I'm finding squash bugs right now in my garden.  So what did you do to get rid of your squash bugs?  The first year, one thing that I think observation is key and having an agronomist master gardener  
**[0:16:46-0:16:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:16:46):**  husband.  Now you have to remember his master gardener training was not through the lens of soil  health.  
**[0:16:52-0:16:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:16:52):**  Right.  So he had to take these frameworks of his knowledge and then continue to plug it into  a soil health framework.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:16:59):**  But what I'll tell you is that it can be done.  It absolutely can be done.  So the first year we had all of the squash in one particular area and it was just a whole  
**[0:17:09-0:17:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:17:09):**  squash patch with all sorts of different types.  What we ended up doing is actually taking that plot of land out of production for two  or three years.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:17:19):**  I mean, that was how we stopped it.  But in subsequent years, we would rotate the planting of our squash throughout the entire  garden space.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:17:30):**  So we wouldn't concentrate the squash bugs in any one particular area.  And the best thing that we did to manage squash bugs was to let them devour an entire plant.  So if there was one that they were eating on and maybe there was a healthy one next  
**[0:17:46-0:18:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:17:46):**  to it, maybe we would sacrifice that healthy one and create this barrier so that the squash  bugs had enough food to eat and then they didn't continue to travel.  So we also had a very, very strict no chemical usage in the garden because my husband was  
**[0:18:04-0:18:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:18:04):**  an agronomist and because of his exposure day in and day out of walking fields, we felt  it really, really important to not use any chemistry in the backyard.  That's not to say I didn't do a pre-emerge on the front of my yard twice in 10 years.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:18:18):**  So full disclosure.  But in the back where the kiddos, the barefoot kiddos and picking berries off the vine and  picking tomatoes and popping them in your mouth, we had to have a zero chemical policy.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:18:33):**  Something I'd like to explore a little bit more is with your husband being more or less  conventionally trained in agronomy and doing that as a day job, is it difficult for him  to reconcile those two parts of his life of having the soil health regenerative garden  
**[0:18:54-0:19:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:18:54):**  at home, but still having to go out every day and walk tillage fields that are being  sprayed?  Oh my gosh, that's the core.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:19:02):**  That's the core of everything, Brian.  You're exactly right.  And that's a little bit of part.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:19:09):**  That's a part of his story, but just to unwind it a little bit.  The first things first, it's hard to listen to your wife.  Your untrained wife, somebody that has no experience, that's not running a business.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:19:22):**  And so as I started learning about some of this, the way that I was sharing information  is I would write these emails on a topic and I would send them to him.  So as he was discovering in his backyard and then thinking about his business and the conventional  
**[0:19:40-0:20:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:19:40):**  cropping systems that he was working in, he was slowly absorbing information, but I would  say that that was very difficult for both of us.  In particular, when we started to understand the chemical load that farmers and ranchers  
**[0:20:00-0:20:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:20:00):**  carry in their bodies, when we started to understand this through the lens of human  health, it became even harder.  So we had, he wouldn't wear his shoes inside.  
**[0:20:10-0:20:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:20:10):**  We'd keep the boots, would stay outside.  The clothing would get separated in different laundry baskets.  If I had the ability to have a second set of washer and dryer, and I know some people  
**[0:20:20-0:20:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:20:20):**  do have a second set of washer and dryers out in a shop or a shed where the clothes  go so that you're not doing, so that you're not exposing, you're not inadvertently bringing  home something that could be harmful to the kiddos.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:20:34):**  And we did have a personal thing happen with our son with a type of exposure.  And so that's what really fueled that.  And that's what made us aware that we need to do something different.  
**[0:20:49-0:21:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:20:49):**  Can we continue to farm at a large scale profitably that is better for the environment, that can  help reduce inputs, and that can help create a better environment for these farm kiddos  and these rural kids that are rural and urban.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:21:08):**  But in particular, I'm really passionate about what I see happening in our neck of the woods  where we used to live.  If we lose a rural population and our ability to produce food, there's not much we have  
**[0:21:22-0:21:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:21:22):**  left.  Absolutely.  So you mentioned a chemical load in the body that a lot of farmers and ranchers are walking  
**[0:21:31-0:21:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:21:31):**  around with.  Of course, that includes me.  Is there a way to measure or understand what chemical load we're walking around with and  
**[0:21:46-0:21:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:21:46):**  what that's doing to our bodies?  Absolutely.  And interestingly enough, it was doctors in a rural setting that helped us understand  
**[0:21:56-0:22:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:21:56):**  this.  And in particular, so the shortest way to answer your question is yes, there's blood  work that you can do.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:22:03):**  In particular, we've used a company called Great Plains Laboratory out of Olathe, Kansas,  and they have a test that can be ran at, I think it's called the GPL Tox.  And what they're looking at is they're looking at certain organophosphate compounds.  
**[0:22:22-0:22:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:22:22):**  And the test can actually help you determine what your load is inside your body.  So I'm not a medical doctor.  Nobody should take advice from me.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:22:30):**  But I'll tell you, a hill-bent mom can learn a lot of information very quickly.  And what we learned as a nutshell is that when your body does take in this chemical  load, the compounds, because of how they're designed to work in the field, they offset  
**[0:22:52-0:23:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:22:52):**  your body's ability to utilize calcium and magnesium.  So this is just an example.  So your heart beats on calcium and it relaxes on magnesium.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:23:04):**  And so when you do have a chemical load in your body that might be caused by an organophosphate,  the chemical load blocks your body's ability to utilize magnesium and calcium.  And there could be a ton of other different examples to use, but that's the one that I  
**[0:23:20-0:23:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:23:20):**  understand it because what ends up happening is it looks like you're having a heart attack.  And it feels like you're having a heart attack, but you're not having a heart attack.  What you have is you have chronic exposure to organophosphates.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:23:35):**  So that's a yes.  Short answer is yes, you can do that.  I think the key is finding a practitioner that can help you with this particular diagnosis  
**[0:23:46-0:23:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:23:46):**  or also with trying to remedy this as a diagnosis.  Okay.  That makes sense.  
**[0:23:55-0:24:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:23:55):**  I guess it even goes back to a lot of farmers and if you're a farmer, it sounds like I'm  picking on you.  Sorry.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:24:03):**  But a lot of conventional farmers around here, up into southern Pratt County, which is what  I see an awful lot, I don't think anybody really thinks about those two and a half gallon  jugs that they dump in that sprayer and what that chemical is and how much of it's on their  
**[0:24:21-0:24:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:24:21):**  body.  And I would imagine that agronomists like your husband that go out and actually walk  fields or ride fields, they probably carry quite a bit more of it than the farmer does.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:24:32):**  Yeah, I think it's hard to say, but based on the particular geography of the area you  just mentioned, that's some high intensive center pivot irrigation farming systems.  So you do, the crop scouting is key, weekly, sometimes biweekly, having somebody out there  
**[0:24:55-0:25:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:24:55):**  is definitely key.  And so one thing I think that's a misconception about this topic and just to be clear, it  took me 10 years to even talk about this.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:25:05):**  The first time I really spoke out about this and I actually didn't think it'd be the topic  of this podcast today, but it's kind of, I like the direction we're going, so let's keep  going.  
**[0:25:14-0:25:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:25:14):**  Yeah, it took like 10 years to even have this because I'm so incredibly sensitive.  I love the farming community and I've never met a single producer that would willingly  do harm.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:25:26):**  Absolutely.  I've never, that's never happened.  But what I think is that nature always wins.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:25:33):**  And as we try to quote unquote fight nature with chemistry, certain things are going to  happen to where we are using more chemistry, putting more out there than what we would  have to do in order to control our weeds and to control our pests.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:25:49):**  Mother nature's funny.  She'll let us think we're winning that war and then all of a sudden she'll pop up with  a super weed that is resistant to everything we can throw at it.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:25:59):**  And then we'll have to come up with something better, something even more lethal, that's  more toxic and more persistent.  Oh, absolutely.  
**[0:26:06-0:26:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:26:06):**  And I think what we're talking about here is really 10 years of life experience.  And so when this question of toxicity came out through the lens of somebody's health,  the first set of doctors was like, well, did you stick your hand in a jug?  
**[0:26:28-0:26:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:26:28):**  Did you stir it with your hand?  Well, nobody does that.  Well, did you drink it?  
**[0:26:33-0:26:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:26:33):**  No, nobody's drinking it.  No, I just walked through fields that the shit is sprayed on for 10 hours a day.  Or re-entry.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:26:41):**  So re-entry is key.  You always, you need to follow the re-entry protocols, make sure you're not going back  out there in the time prior to when they consider it safe.  
**[0:26:52-0:27:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:26:52):**  So none of that was happening.  What it was is it was a chronic exposure.  And what happens is you will have an acute reaction to a chronic exposure.  
**[0:27:04-0:27:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:27:04):**  So that's really how we learned about it.  And then finally, there was a doctor that came to us and said, you're having some sort  of reaction.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:27:12):**  This is a reaction.  And you need to find a doctor who works with toxicity and figure out what it is.  And so that took us to Wichita, Kansas of all places.  
**[0:27:21-0:27:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:27:21):**  And we can stick some links of some really fabulous medical doctors who are helping people  in the ag community get rid of some of these toxins and be able to take back their physical  and their health.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:27:36):**  So why isn't anybody talking about it?  How come we're not seeing this on the news that there's a health epidemic with pesticides  and herbicides and acute toxicity or chronic toxicity problems?  
**[0:27:49-0:28:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:27:49):**  I've been afraid to tell this story for 10 years, guys.  Fear.  I think that there is a fear of even like big ag, right?  
**[0:28:04-0:28:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:28:04):**  Well nobody's going to pull sponsorship from us.  So I mean.  No, no they're not.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:28:08):**  Yeah.  And I don't think that like those type of labels really listen to us anyways.  But I think that also people don't want to admit that what they're doing is causing harm  
**[0:28:23-0:28:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:28:23):**  because they'd have to transition, right?  They'd have to, I don't know.  I think it's just fear, yes.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:28:31):**  So about eight years ago, I did start to kind of go down and I'm skipping over a lot of  the stories.  So in the meantime, I realized that I needed to focus on things that I could change.  
**[0:28:44-0:28:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:28:44):**  Ultimately, the only thing a mom or a dad can change are the four walls of your own  house.  Yes.  
**[0:28:50-0:29:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:28:50):**  I expanded that out to my backyard, back to my soil.  I wanted to have a market for some of the products I was producing.  So we, along with some other folks in the area, we started a farmer's market.  
**[0:29:03-0:29:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:29:03):**  There was a co-op that is still in existence today.  It was Azure Standard is still going on down there.  I mean, I really put things into actionable steps and I joined the health coalition.  
**[0:29:18-0:29:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:29:18):**  I had amazing support from the hospital.  It was interesting.  The hospital health coalitions supported local food.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:29:25):**  That was such a hands down.  They're like, oh yeah, we need more local food.  We need more local food producers.  
**[0:29:31-0:29:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:29:31):**  This question of conventional agriculture really is not conducive for growing fruits  and vegetables and especially crops because they're too sensitive to dicamba drift and  they're too sensitive to just a lot of different things.  
**[0:29:49-0:30:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:29:49):**  So I've watched producers in that area start up businesses and then have to backtrack because  their crop ground of maybe five acres isn't protected from drift.  So I did speak out about eight years ago and was told to sit down.  
**[0:30:11-0:30:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:30:11):**  My husband got a phone call and they said, do you know what your wife is up to?  Because people don't want to, especially back then.  So I did, I recoiled and I didn't say another word about it until literally like 2020.  
**[0:30:24-0:30:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:30:24):**  So when the pandemic came out, I feel like, I don't know.  I mean, I'm not the type of person to say the gloves are off, let's go for it.  Even though I just said that out loud and it felt good.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:30:34):**  So what I want to do is how can we advocate?  How can we not have another generation lost in these small rural towns of Kansas?  How can we not watch what a lot of us have worked so hard for in agriculture?  
**[0:30:49-0:31:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:30:49):**  And I love farming and I love being a part of this, but I also, it hurts my heart when  I see schools close or when I see grocery stores close.  I mean, I don't have all the answers.  
**[0:31:00-0:31:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:31:00):**  I can see it too.  You know, I've lived out here in rural Kansas for my whole life and I've watched the population  in every town around me except Wichita just slowly, slowly bleed away.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:31:14):**  And it was probably in 2019 when I met Mike Calacrate and he said a few things and I kind  of woke up to Dollar General.  It's like, okay, now I'm really starting to see how businesses like Dollar General  
**[0:31:31-0:31:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:31:31):**  will come into a functioning rural community.  And yeah, on the surface, the city planner, city administrators are like, oh yeah, Dollar  General, that's great.  
**[0:31:40-0:31:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:31:40):**  We'll get five more jobs.  But they don't realize that it's going to cost the three jobs at the grocery store,  one job at the convenience store and maybe two or three others in town.  
**[0:31:52-0:32:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:31:52):**  And no healthcare, no benefits, just…  It's predatory is what it is.  And it's a business model that is very clearly working for them.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:32:04):**  Oh, it works for them.  I mean, it's a wealth extraction.  It's a wealth transfer.  
**[0:32:08-0:32:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:32:08):**  It's Dollar General to me when I see a Dollar General pop up in a rural community of like  300 people, I look at that and go, that's the vulture showing up to strip mine the last  remaining wealth out of this community.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:32:26):**  So let me ask you this question.  Is that commodity thinking?  Are we now commoditizing, I don't know if that's the right word, our small towns?  
**[0:32:36-0:32:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:32:36):**  Is that not like a byproduct of the commodity markets that have dominated agriculture for  the last couple of decades?  And is the solution refocusing and recentralizing our goods, not only our food, but all of our  
**[0:32:53-0:33:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:32:53):**  goods?  I mean, yeah, I'm not talking about 40 acres and a mule here.  I'm talking about like, how do we think of our small towns and protect them from the  
**[0:33:03-0:33:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:33:03):**  disruptions we've already seen because of COVID?  I mean, I had a friend who knew somebody high up at Kroger.  And when the pandemic hit, there was rumors, I don't know if they ended up being true,  
**[0:33:15-0:33:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:33:15):**  that there's only three days worth of supply chain that could get out to some of these  small towns.  And what if these trucking systems or what if this supply chain could only deliver to  
**[0:33:27-0:33:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:33:27):**  Wichita and they couldn't drive an hour out to Pratt?  What if that happened?  Those are scary what ifs.  
**[0:33:36-0:33:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:33:36):**  I know.  I mean, those are big scary what ifs.  Is Dollar General going to save you?  
**[0:33:41-0:33:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:33:41):**  No, your garden in your backyard is going to save you.  Your neighbors that are growing food are going to save you.  So the commoditization of everything, including our thought processes and how we think about  
**[0:33:57-0:34:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:33:57):**  things, I'm sure that a lot of that has kind of crept in unconsciously.  The bigger point to be made when you're dancing around it is it takes energy to transport  food.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:34:11):**  And over the last 18 months, we've seen so many supply chain disruptions.  Food businesses like restaurants can't find help.  The price of meat in the stores has skyrocketed, but the price of cattle and sheep and goats  
**[0:34:29-0:34:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:34:29):**  and pigs is as low as ever.  And fuel, the price of fuel is going up.  Diesel fuel, I think it's on top of $4 a gallon now or pretty close.  
**[0:34:42-0:35:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:34:42):**  And in places like out in Colorado, it's close to $5, but that's mountain economics.  Every increase in transportation costs just kind of compounds.  Like you said earlier, we grow almost nothing here that we eat.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:35:00):**  95 plus percent of our food in Kansas is imported.  We got a lot of listeners that aren't just in Kansas.  I would almost say that every state, probably except California, you're importing 90 plus  
**[0:35:14-0:35:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:35:14):**  percent of your food.  Yeah, I think so.  And the danger of that is, we've seen in the last 18 months all these supply chains getting  
**[0:35:24-0:35:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:35:24):**  weak and failing.  Ford, Chevy, Dodge, Toyota, Nissan, they've all shut down production of cars because they  can't get microchips.  
**[0:35:38-0:35:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:35:38):**  Long term supply chain disruptions that we haven't even begun to see that have their  roots 18 months ago, we're not done with it yet.  We're not done seeing the supply chain disruptions from COVID.  
**[0:35:52-0:36:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:35:52):**  I think they're just getting warmed up.  I agree.  And I think I kind of fall into this category too.  
**[0:36:01-0:36:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:36:01):**  Sometimes it does feel like the problem is so big that it's like, how do you deal with  all that?  Like, how do you process all that?  
**[0:36:07-0:36:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:36:07):**  How does one individual make an impact?  Is that even possible?  And I don't know the answer to that.  
**[0:36:15-0:36:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:36:15):**  By no means am I trying to make it sound like I think soil health or regenerative agriculture  is the only solution, but that is actually where I find my hope.  It's not Disneyland.  
**[0:36:28-0:36:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:36:28):**  This isn't magic, folks.  This is actually deciding that you're concerned about the way things are and that what can  you do?  
**[0:36:39-0:36:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:36:39):**  What can you actually do to maybe help something or change something?  So I think that's where the work that I do in soil health and in regenerative agriculture,  that's my answer to all this.  
**[0:36:51-0:37:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:36:51):**  So the whole 10-year story that I've kind of laid out, really, there's so many other  details, so many other factors that I was really encouraged by some people that I love  dearly and they said, okay, Jessica, you have the ability to communicate.  
**[0:37:08-0:37:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:37:08):**  You're good at, you know, I don't know what I'm good at, about planning.  I have an idea.  So put it to work.  
**[0:37:14-0:37:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:37:14):**  So that's what I've done.  I've decided to make a lot of these topics my career.  And that's a good segue to talk about Great Plains Regeneration and what you're trying  
**[0:37:25-0:37:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:37:25):**  to do to help the situation with GPR.  Yeah, so GPR is a nonprofit that I have the fortunate ability to be trusted by my colleagues  to be able to run.  
**[0:37:40-0:37:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:37:40):**  And we were co-founded by farmers and ranchers and other key stakeholders that have been  working in this whole RegenerVac movement for a number of years.  And so as a nonprofit, our goal is really to be a liaison between large and small stakeholders,  
**[0:37:58-0:38:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:37:58):**  which sounds like the most generic comment you could basically say.  This idea of decommoditizing certain sectors of agriculture by creating new markets seems  like something that is achievable and that we can do.  
**[0:38:14-0:38:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:38:14):**  And so how do we liaison some of these either large and it's coming from all sectors.  We're seeing food companies, we're seeing fashion companies, we're seeing manufacturing  companies.  
**[0:38:26-0:38:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:38:26):**  I'm working with a sustainable t-shirt company right now.  So how do we create these conversations for how goods and crops and products are produced  at the agricultural level?  
**[0:38:38-0:38:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:38:38):**  How do we liaison them up to becoming products that consumers can purchase?  So that's kind of the overall goal of Great Plains Regeneration and our modes of activation  of doing this are farmer-led, rancher-led education.  
**[0:38:56-0:39:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:38:56):**  We want to do that in the entire High Plains, Great Plains region.  And that's something that I've done for a number of years.  So that was kind of low-hanging fruit.  
**[0:39:04-0:39:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:39:04):**  It was like, let's keep educating.  I am not an agronomist and I don't ever tell anybody how to farm, but what I do and what  I think that is the top of my skillset is I connect those with the information to those  
**[0:39:16-0:39:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:39:16):**  who need the information.  So GPR is not a nonprofit that's going to tell people how to farm, but what we want  to do is we want to facilitate this transaction of knowledge.  
**[0:39:28-0:39:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:39:28):**  So the second way that we activate our programming is through watershed regeneration.  We're working really closely with the Kansas Alliance for Wetlands and Streams.  And I think that the ultimate outcome of our work is better water quality, improved water  
**[0:39:43-0:40:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:39:43):**  infiltration not only on the crop fields, but down into the municipal cities, Oklahoma  City, Kansas City, Omaha.  These are all things that ask a city what their biggest line item budget is and it's  
**[0:40:00-0:40:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:40:00):**  making sure that the citizens have clean water.  And then I already kind of hit on new market development, but this idea that we can produce  goods locally or hyper regionally or in nodes of clusters of farmers that are working together.  
**[0:40:16-0:40:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:40:16):**  We're working on an agroforestry project right now and I made beer.  So we worked with a local brewer in Northeast Kansas.  We got him connected to our farmer network.  
**[0:40:27-0:40:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:40:27):**  He was able to source some turkey red wheat that was grown using soil health practices  like no till and cover crops and zero inputs.  And we made a really delicious beer.  
**[0:40:40-0:40:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:40:40):**  It was a one-off, it was a prototype, but it's in liquor stores and grocery stores right  now if you're in Northeast Kansas.  And so we're hoping to use this as a demonstration of what we can do in the future.  
**[0:40:54-0:41:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:40:54):**  I almost wish I drank beer so I could try it.  Our hope, Jess, is if we host an event, we can have a regenerative beer or regenerative  like bar.  
**[0:41:11-0:41:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:41:11):**  So we've been trying to collect brands who are doing that.  So we have a whiskey brand that does stuff, the soil health wine.  I think that's kind of it though.  
**[0:41:22-0:41:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:41:22):**  So now we have a beer we can source.  Yes.  Well, what's really great is there's a huge trend in craft beer and it's a totally new  
**[0:41:31-0:41:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:41:31):**  topic that I've had to dive in head first and really figure out.  But here's the thing, it doesn't take long.  If you guys have something, we can work on a formulation and get out there and source  
**[0:41:42-0:41:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:41:42):**  the products.  I mean, I think there's great hope for producers to be able to sell directly to either malt  houses or breweries, something like that.  
**[0:41:52-0:42:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:41:52):**  I think that's something that we can add into this conversation of regenerative agriculture  is regenerating our beer supply chain.  Speaking of beer, because I did kind of, even though I don't drink, I did kind of do a little  
**[0:42:07-0:42:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:42:07):**  bit of research into beer making.  We can grow everything you need to make beer in Kansas, even hops.  Correct.  
**[0:42:20-0:42:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:42:20):**  And we do.  But one of the things we don't have anywhere in Kansas, and I'm sure they're around, but  is a malting facility, someplace that will malt your grain for you.  
**[0:42:31-0:42:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:42:31):**  Yeah, and that's one thing that we're doing some exploratory conversations about that  and some feasibility studies.  But that was kind of our first thought process.  
**[0:42:45-0:43:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:42:45):**  You talk a lot about this on other podcasts about building the infrastructure.  When it comes to local meat, we need to have the packing houses and the places, the distributors.  And so I agree with what you just said, Brian.  
**[0:43:02-0:43:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:43:02):**  I think there's an opportunity there for this region of Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma.  Can we malt here?  Can we do that?  
**[0:43:10-0:43:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:43:10):**  We found that in particular, the winter barley can be grown well in this region.  And then also rye.  Let's grow rye for beer.  
**[0:43:24-0:43:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:43:24):**  To me, that just kind of makes sense.  But here's the thing.  We can't do any of this unless we have markets.  
**[0:43:29-0:43:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:43:29):**  And I have found that farmers and ranchers are the most innovative and willing to change  operations when there's a market involved.  And so that's really where we're at right now with this conversation is how do we ensure  
**[0:43:45-0:43:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:43:45):**  that this crop that we're asking producers to grow, which is probably not going to be  covered under crop insurance or other type of programs that they might be currently enrolled  in, how do we de-risk this situation and produce it?  
**[0:43:59-0:44:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:43:59):**  Well, I think that circles back around to what we were talking about a few minutes ago  about the commoditization of everything.  Cultural systems are set up to deal with mass quantities of one or two products.  
**[0:44:13-0:44:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:44:13):**  A co-op doesn't want to deal with somebody growing 400 acres of barley and 15 different  crops because they don't have anywhere to store it and they don't want to try to sell  it.  
**[0:44:24-0:44:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:44:24):**  So the co-ops, they tell everybody corn, wheat, soybeans, if you want to sell it here because  that's all we're going to buy this year.  Access to markets, it's not just in the meat space.  
**[0:44:35-0:44:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:44:35):**  It's definitely in the crop space and not just talking about the big commodity crops  that are grown.  I think it was at Soil of Health a year or two ago where somebody came out and said that  
**[0:44:51-0:45:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:44:51):**  there were over 4300 acres of red potatoes in Kansas and it was almost like 7 or 10%  of the nation's red potato output.  I'm thinking 4000 acres isn't that much.  
**[0:45:06-0:45:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:45:06):**  No.  What are you saying?  Like 45,000 acres of red potatoes is all the red potatoes we need for the country for the  
**[0:45:13-0:45:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:45:13):**  year.  That's really not that much.  But it's access to market, it's access to a processing plant, a place to store the potatoes  
**[0:45:22-0:45:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:45:22):**  and a way to market them that's lacking because everything is so commoditized because,  oh well, we grow wheat in Kansas so everybody grows wheat in Kansas.  Well, let's grow some other stuff too like barley and rye.  
**[0:45:38-0:45:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:45:38):**  Rye grows wild.  There are a lot of wheat fields where they spend a lot of money per acre every year to  keep the rye out of it.  
**[0:45:48-0:45:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:45:48):**  Well, and that's why anytime I brought that up to my husband, he's like, oh my God, lady,  you are going to wreck me.  You're talking about, yeah, let's grow some more rye here for beer.  
**[0:45:58-0:46:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:45:58):**  But you're exactly right.  Like the corn that they need for bourbon, guys, it's nothing.  Let's figure out ways to make these connections and help prop people up profitably.  
**[0:46:14-0:46:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:46:14):**  You need to talk to Russell Hedrick.  He's got a great presentation about the economics of corn whiskey.  We'll get you connected to him.  
**[0:46:26-0:46:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:46:26):**  But no, it does.  These are all the things that we're trying to work on once we launched the nonprofit  and once we started to sprinkle out some of the work that we wanted to do.  
**[0:46:38-0:46:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:46:38):**  We're really getting some great positive feedback about how a nonprofit can help in this situation  and how we can liaison different people to be a part of the conversation to make it happen.  Because what I find is apparel companies, food companies, all of these other different  
**[0:46:58-0:47:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:46:58):**  industries that are looking at the soil, they don't know how to have the conversation.  Yeah.  You're like the bridge.  
**[0:47:06-0:47:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:47:06):**  You're just bridging them, those two conversations together.  So I think we talked to, when I talk to people who are in those industries too, they want  to have the conversation like you say.  
**[0:47:20-0:47:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:47:20):**  And so you just have to feed them two or three things to educate them.  And then after that, it kind of just catches with them, their curiosity where they can  figure out how to keep that conversation going.  
**[0:47:34-0:47:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:47:34):**  And that's my great hope.  And what we did with Wilcott Brewing in Holton, Kansas, when we had this idea of producing  this beer and the beer was actually going to be a special edition beer for our fundraiser.  
**[0:47:46-0:47:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:47:46):**  So we thought, okay, if we're going to be talking about fellow help, regenerative agriculture,  connecting consumers to farmers, we need to have an event where there's local food, local  farmers, civic engagement, environmentalists.  
**[0:47:59-0:48:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:47:59):**  We had tribes, we had the Preban Potawatomi, Maya tribe.  We had members from the Winnebago and Nebraska.  So when we went to the brewer, we're like, hey, we should really produce this local beer  
**[0:48:12-0:48:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:48:12):**  and we want to use regenerative.  He said, what's regenerative?  And he actually, I've heard this before, he actually lost sleep that night because he  
**[0:48:25-0:48:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:48:25):**  started researching regenerative and he was up all night and he called me the next morning  and he's like, I want my whole operation to be regenerative.  So let me, oh, he totally did.  
**[0:48:37-0:48:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:48:37):**  I was like, that was the Kool-Aid man.  You just, you're drinking from a fire hose right now.  So anyway, but guess what happened the day after that?  
**[0:48:47-0:48:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:48:47):**  He called back and he goes, it doesn't exist, Jessica.  Like there's not regenerative products.  What are we going to do?  
**[0:48:54-0:49:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:48:54):**  So we formulated a plan.  We were able to source some organic, we were able to use proximity, malting.  We were able to get a particular profile of malt that he wanted and I'm not a maltster,  
**[0:49:06-0:49:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:49:06):**  so I don't know anything about that.  And so we were able to put it together.  So just for context, we call it partially regenerative because we, you know, and he  
**[0:49:15-0:49:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:49:15):**  had a real problem.  He goes, Jessica, we can't call this regenerative.  If I can't source it 100%.  
**[0:49:20-0:49:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:49:20):**  Regenerative, right?  Yeah.  They have transitioning organic labels now, right?  
**[0:49:25-0:49:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:49:25):**  Yeah, they do.  Yeah.  And you know, that's fair.  
**[0:49:29-0:49:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:49:29):**  As long as things are labeled, labeled appropriately.  Yeah.  So we did stand behind that, supporting that, right?  
**[0:49:36-0:49:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:49:36):**  Yeah.  Well, and we, you know, I guess part of our goal was to really do some robust storytelling.  And when we were on stage at the event, that's one thing that I mentioned is that the desire  
**[0:49:48-0:50:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:49:48):**  is there to make these connections, but there are some, some loose ends in the system that  we're working on to be able to close these loops so that we do have this.  And you know, this is, we could have a whole nother podcast about this.  
**[0:50:03-0:50:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:50:03):**  Is the product itself regenerative or is the system in which the crop was grown regenerative?  So I am leaning towards that the product itself is not regenerative.  It's the system in which it was grown.  
**[0:50:21-0:50:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:50:21):**  And guess what?  I think it can change year to year.  So I don't want to certify a crop or certify a field.  
**[0:50:28-0:50:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:50:28):**  Hey, this is regenerative because we're dealing with, with systems and we're dealing with  nature.  And I think that we would, you know, once again, be slapping nature across the base  
**[0:50:37-0:50:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:50:37):**  if we said, Oh yeah, yeah, this product, we think it's regenerative because of this checklist  that we did, you know, a couple of years ago where we certified quote unquote.  So I think it's, it's, we got a lot we could talk about right now.  
**[0:50:50-0:51:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:50:50):**  Yeah, Brian and I talk about that too, because I think when we'll see, especially like on  like social media groups, people arguing about that's not the regenerative way.  And I think Brian, what you say is, is, you know, just if you can set it in your context  
**[0:51:07-0:51:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:51:07):**  and get 80% of, of the regenerative principles, then you're regenerative.  You don't have to follow a Bible and you know,  You got to start where you are and it's a journey.  
**[0:51:22-0:51:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:51:22):**  You know, it's, it's a journey and we're all still learning together.  And I think that's, that, that's an important thing to note is, you know, nobody knows it  all and I'm not even sure that if you put, you know, a hundred of the best regenerative  
**[0:51:38-0:51:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:51:38):**  agriculture minds in the same room that you could say, they've got it all figured out.  Like we're all still learning.  Yes, see, and I think that's why I feel like it is never ever my goal to be an activist  
**[0:51:54-0:52:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:51:54):**  and to fight something.  It's like, uh, you know, we're going to fight climate change or we're going to win the war.  No, that's, you know, it might just be my nature, my personality, but I'm here to advocate  
**[0:52:08-0:52:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:52:08):**  for individual change and the way, you know, I always talk about this.  So we have principles of, uh, regenerative agriculture principles of soil health.  And within those principles, there are multiple practices in which a person can utilize based  
**[0:52:27-0:52:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:52:27):**  on their own, you know, geographical location, their own place based agricultural systems  that they can use to achieve a principle.  So who am I to say, you know, pick apart one practice, this is this, this is that I am  
**[0:52:43-0:53:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:52:43):**  advocating for, um, you know, self-realization for further education and for the adoption  of a place-based appropriate practices that help achieve their soil health goals.  And that is for each individual farmer rancher to determine for themselves in my opinion.  
**[0:53:05-0:53:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:53:05):**  So how would you define regenerative agriculture or what would you say would describe over  80% of the regenerative producers?  OMG, you should have told me you're going to ask me that question, Brian.  
**[0:53:24-0:53:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:53:24):**  It just came to me.  Um, so here's my way of weaseling out of it.  You know, I, a couple of years ago, I put that on, on social media and I got like 106  
**[0:53:37-0:53:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:53:37):**  different responses to it.  And I would say that is the core.  The question you just asked is the core of, of what all of us is trying to understand.  
**[0:53:49-0:53:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:53:49):**  And I don't know, ask me again in a month and I might have a different way of describing  it.  Um, the way that I'm leaning towards now is, is exactly what, what I just said is that  
**[0:53:58-0:54:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:53:58):**  we've got the principles of regenerative agriculture and the ways in which each producer applies  their own practices will determine whether or not a system is regenerative.  So I don't know, we work with, uh, one of our advisors is Ray Archuleta and he has a  
**[0:54:16-0:54:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:54:16):**  description that talks about the conversion of the hearts and minds is regenerative agriculture.  And that really what our goal is, is that we want to think differently and we want to  feel differently and we want to act differently when it term it, when it comes to our agricultural  
**[0:54:34-0:54:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:54:34):**  systems.  So that's probably not the answer that you were looking for in all reality.  Um, but I don't know that I, I, every presentation we do, every single conference we do, um,  
**[0:54:49-0:54:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:54:49):**  that question gets asked and, and I think it's because people need something to wrap  their brains around.  They want to say regenerative agriculture is this, and I'm not positive.  
**[0:54:59-0:55:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:54:59):**  I know exactly.  Even after 10 years, I'm not even exactly sure that I have the best answer for that.  I have my own answer.  
**[0:55:08-0:55:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:55:08):**  But it's, it's not just a small change.  I mean, it's a whole different paradigm.  It's a whole different way of thinking and looking at the world and thinking about food  
**[0:55:17-0:55:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:55:17):**  production and agriculture.  So for us, it was, uh, it was ending jobs, selling houses and moving.  That's how we, that's how we found our regenerative pathway.  
**[0:55:34-0:55:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:55:34):**  So we'll shift gears a little bit here.  How do we affect change in the system as a whole?  Like systems don't change.  
**[0:55:46-0:56:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:55:46):**  I mean, systems or models only change in unison and the larger and more complex a system is,  the more resistant to dramatic change it is, but also the more complex assist, you know,  complex and largest system is the more prone it is to failure when unforeseen, um, things  
**[0:56:10-0:56:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:56:10):**  act on that system like COVID and supply chain pressures.  So what can people start doing?  You know, what, what can producers start doing to encourage more return of agriculture?  
**[0:56:27-0:56:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:56:27):**  And then what can consumers do to, to enable that change?  So what can farmers and ranchers do?  Um, I think after having experience in the way that we communicate our topics and our  
**[0:56:44-0:57:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:56:44):**  mission is that those of us that, um, have a knowledge base or those of us that, that  have, um, you know, experience, maybe even like yourself.  From my point of view, it's becoming humble and being available to where if a producer  
**[0:57:00-0:57:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:57:00):**  wants to ask some of these questions that they, they feel comfortable doing it.  I was just asked a couple of weeks ago to speak at a private field day.  There was zero advertising.  
**[0:57:11-0:57:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:57:11):**  There was nothing about it on Facebook, the cover crop field tour that we went to, the  plot, the plots were put way far away from the highway.  And so I just felt like this super covert operation.  
**[0:57:26-0:57:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:57:26):**  And what it was is, is it was a peer group of farmers that wanted to learn about soil  health, but they didn't want to draw attention.  They didn't want, um, yeah, I mean, they just went about it in a different way.  
**[0:57:38-0:57:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:57:38):**  And so they had asked me to be a part of it and to share a little bit about our message  and about the work that we do with GPR and a small group, about 15 people.  And it was really interesting because after I talked, there weren't any questions and  
**[0:57:52-0:57:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:57:52):**  I thought, Oh God, what did you know?  Did I say something?  Did I offend somebody?  
**[0:57:57-0:58:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:57:57):**  And a couple hours later after dinner, I was walking out and there was a group of producers  sitting on the back of the pickup truck and they called me over and this one gal, she's  like, Hey, we're really sorry that we didn't have any questions for you.  
**[0:58:08-0:58:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:58:08):**  And I said, Oh, you know, that's okay.  These things happen.  And she said, this is so new to us.  
**[0:58:14-0:58:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:58:14):**  This is the first time any of us have ever been, you know, uh, introduced to this whole  regenerative thing.  And we just need to absorb it for awhile.  
**[0:58:22-0:58:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:58:22):**  So to get, to answer your question, Brian is be available for conversations, understand  that the conversation might go differently than what you anticipate and let's not sell  Disneyland here.  
**[0:58:34-0:58:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:58:34):**  Let's be like, let's sell it the way that it actually is at the field level.  If we over romanticize things, and if we make it feel too much like a fantasy world, then  it will be, and that's not what our goal is.  
**[0:58:48-0:59:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:58:48):**  And then I think that talking to consumers is, uh, you know, I, I actually just pulled  out a definition that I used a couple of weeks ago at our Lawrence, Kansas event.  And I put regenerative agriculture as a way to use the planet's own natural systems to  
**[0:59:05-0:59:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:59:05):**  re re balance our climate while meaningfully supporting the farmers and ranchers.  We all rely on every day to grow the food on this table that we're eating right now.  So I think the way that we want to talk to consumers is that, um, you know, farmers and  
**[0:59:23-0:59:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:59:23):**  ranchers are our best allies in this whole conversation.  They are that they are the folks on the ground that can, um, help us turn this tide.  And so when we go to the farmer's market and we have questions about the food, just talk  
**[0:59:37-0:59:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:59:37):**  to the, to the vendors, you know, talk to the people like on shop, Kansas farms that  are selling direct pasture raised, or, you know, organic grass fed, just have the conversation  and then don't be afraid to support somebody because they're, they're in transition and  
**[0:59:54-1:00:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=0:59:54):**  they're trying to develop a system that's not fully ready yet.  Um, but they need our support in the meantime.  So very interestingly, you know, I'm, you know, let's not be activists.  
**[1:00:04-1:00:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:00:04):**  Let's not shoot the messenger.  Let's get out there and try to support the knowledge shift.  And I'll just add one more thing.  
**[1:00:13-1:00:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:00:13):**  I think that there have been folks that have been a part of like the early adopter phase  of this movement.  And my prediction is that the way we scale this into the middle part of the folks that  
**[1:00:30-1:00:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:00:30):**  want to be, um, involved in regenerative, I think the way in which that is done looks  differently.  I think that regenerative 2.0, that those people that are willing to make changes at  
**[1:00:41-1:00:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:00:41):**  this point, they think about technology different.  They think about innovation differently.  They think about government programs differently, and they're willing to work together for profitability  
**[1:00:51-1:01:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:00:51):**  differently than the early adopter.  So my prediction is that the way we scale regenerative looks different than how we got  here.  
**[1:01:01-1:01:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:01:01):**  So I'm rolling that concept around.  You just threw out regeneration 2.0.  I remember the promise of the web 2.0.  
**[1:01:12-1:01:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:01:12):**  And I don't remember a big change, but maybe that's just because I'm the wrong generation.  And so I'm thinking of this in the context of, you know, we've got a lot of landowners  and farmers and ranchers that are just on the very hairy edge of aging out.  
**[1:01:33-1:01:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:01:33):**  And we've got a generation that's really young that wants to get involved in their food.  And there's a whole middle generation that I'm kind of a part of that a lot of us missed  that.  
**[1:01:44-1:01:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:01:44):**  And, you know, there's some of us in that, you know, in this, you know, 30s, 40s demographic  that have been doing it for a while.  And maybe we are the some of the early regenerative ranchers and farmers.  
**[1:01:56-1:02:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:01:56):**  So what does regeneration 2.0 look like with another generation, with the next generation  of farmers and ranchers coming in and the existing older generation aging out?  You know, I think the vernacular is going to change a little bit.  
**[1:02:14-1:02:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:02:14):**  The way that we talk in these circles, I think is going to change.  You don't hear a lot about the words climate change, but the description and what we're  seeing at the field level is a changing climate.  
**[1:02:29-1:02:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:02:29):**  So I think that as this generation, this 2.0 comes out, I think there's going to be a greater  acknowledgement that, you know, whether it's you now have a fire season or we're experiencing  desertification due to a disruption of a small water cycle.  
**[1:02:46-1:03:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:02:46):**  Like those were some of the things that were said before, but now I think it's clear and  present for this next generation and their dad and granddad didn't have to address it.  It was just on the fringes people were talking about climate change, floods, water, whatever.  
**[1:03:05-1:03:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:03:05):**  This next generation is actually going to have to be the ones that adapt to it and make  the changes.  And so whatever you want to call it, if you want to call it a changing climate, climate  
**[1:03:14-1:03:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:03:14):**  change, if we are adding in more environmental speak to the conversation, you know, talking  about downstream water quality and being able to bridge these connections back to what I  call like civic engagement.  
**[1:03:30-1:03:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:03:30):**  That's what I think we're going to see a little bit more of.  And that's what GPR is trying to do.  I want to put the mic, I want to give the mic to a farmer to talk to civic leaders and  
**[1:03:42-1:03:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:03:42):**  lawmakers.  And I have one more thing to add too.  Oh, go ahead.  
**[1:03:47-1:03:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:03:47):**  Go ahead.  Add.  You know, the emergence of different markets are going to change things, whether it is  
**[1:03:54-1:04:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:03:54):**  selling water credits, whether it's selling carbon credits, soil carbon sequestration,  I think is going to be, is going to hold a pivotal role in this change.  I don't exactly know how that's going to get flushed out right now.  
**[1:04:06-1:04:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:04:06):**  I'm kind of keeping myself at a distance and watching and observing and trying to determine  the benefit to the producer at this level.  But I do think that those are all going to be factors that this 2.0 is going to be a  
**[1:04:19-1:04:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:04:19):**  lot more open-minded to consider and to actually have impact their farmer ranch.  I think on some level, carbon programs, carbon sequestration payments will drive a lot of  regeneration 2.0 and will drive a lot of transition.  
**[1:04:40-1:05:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:04:40):**  I think so, but I just want to make sure that the reasons why a person changes is supported  by education and is supported by a matrix of decision-making, not just I'm going to  grow a cover crop right now because that's additionality and I'm going to get a payment.  
**[1:05:00-1:05:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:05:00):**  I hope that it actually drives a systems change that's lasting.  And so, like I said, bringing in some more of this environmental talk to the conversation  in a not scary way, they're going to say, okay, well, this cover crop, when applied  
**[1:05:19-1:05:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:05:19):**  effectively to my particular operation is going to help me with water infiltration,  it's going to help me use the rainfall that I do get versus erosion or having it wash  down all of my nutrients to the neighbor's farm.  
**[1:05:35-1:05:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:05:35):**  And I'm hoping that because of these markets, we're actually building a framework for  knowledge and a better framework for decision-making.  How much resistance do you think that regenerative practices get at the producer level simply  
**[1:05:52-1:06:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:05:52):**  from a political standpoint?  Like I don't believe in that liberal hippie climate change crap.  I'm not going to change what I'm doing.  
**[1:06:01-1:06:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:06:01):**  How much of that is driven just by nonsense?  I think in the beginning, so a number of years ago, I think in the beginning a lot because  funny story, God bless my father-in-law, but we had brought this up to him.  
**[1:06:18-1:06:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:06:18):**  He's not a rancher, but his brothers are, a lot of folks in our family are.  Isn't just breathing the word carbon to him probably five or six years ago because, oh,  he goes, oh gosh, who was the guy that invented the internet?  
**[1:06:39-1:06:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:06:39):**  I just saw Al Gore, right?  Al Gore, yeah.  He's like, oh, Al Gore's back.  
**[1:06:42-1:06:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:06:42):**  He's back.  And it was just, you could tell it was like this crazy political divide.  And at that point we knew that that wasn't the best audience to be talking about soil  
**[1:06:53-1:07:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:06:53):**  carbon sequestration.  So we dropped it.  But it is kind of funny because I was listening to my husband a couple of weeks ago and he  
**[1:07:02-1:07:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:07:02):**  ended up reviewing how this works.  How do we have this legacy load of carbon in the atmosphere and how do we lock it back  into the soil and should we?  
**[1:07:17-1:07:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:07:17):**  And what are the benefits if we do?  So I guess just, I totally agree with you, Brian.  I think in the beginning it's really politically charged.  
**[1:07:25-1:07:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:07:25):**  But what we really have to distinguish is that what we're talking about now is soil  carbon sequestration.  I think the measurement of it, the quantification of it, that's all over the board.  
**[1:07:37-1:07:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:07:37):**  I'm not an expert on that.  But what I do know is that when we lock the carbon in the soil, we change the way that  the soil functions.  
**[1:07:46-1:07:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:07:46):**  We change the biology.  We change the smell, the color, the texture, the aggregation.  And so why not do it?  
**[1:07:54-1:08:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:07:54):**  I think the mindset now is like whatever.  Is it climate change?  Is it some hippie voodoo?  
**[1:08:02-1:08:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:08:02):**  Somebody one time called it hippie voodoo to me.  You know, whatever.  Does it help your operation?  
**[1:08:08-1:08:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:08:08):**  Are you growing better crops?  Are you more resistant to too much rainfall and not enough rainfall?  Yeah, whatever.  
**[1:08:15-1:08:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:08:15):**  That's what I'm saying.  I think this generation that's coming up, they don't care to be a part of Grandpa's  political debate anymore.  
**[1:08:23-1:08:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:08:23):**  Yeah.  Let's get in there.  Let's do the work.  
**[1:08:26-1:08:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:08:26):**  Let's figure it out.  It's so funny.  Jess, I totally had a lawyer talk to me about the carbon stuff who had been, had dealt with  
**[1:08:36-1:08:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:08:36):**  the Al Gore carbon stuff.  Yeah.  And he was just, he's like, he was burnt on it basically.  
**[1:08:42-1:08:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:08:42):**  Oh yeah.  For me, I learned, I learned what our predecessors had to deal with, with even having that word.  So I totally learned some empathy of like, okay, we, we've got to do this revamp and  
**[1:08:54-1:09:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:08:54):**  we have to do it well.  We have to do it in the benefit for the farmers and the ranchers.  Well then they need to be, they need to be the ones leading it.  
**[1:09:03-1:09:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:09:03):**  So farmers and ranchers need to be the one that's leading it.  We don't need a system of a wagging finger saying, you will do this, you will do that.  If you want to piss off this group of people, tell them how they're going to do something.  
**[1:09:17-1:09:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:09:17):**  Exactly.  But if we can encourage them and if we can show that, that this is, you know, better  for profitability, better for, um, you know, the, the, the operation as a whole while at  
**[1:09:31-1:09:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:09:31):**  the same time, having these reaping, these amazing environmental benefits.  Yes.  That's going to be the key.  
**[1:09:36-1:09:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:09:36):**  That's going to be the key and making it realistic.  Like Brian, we've done a number of conferences together and one of these days I'm going to  hold true on my promise.  
**[1:09:45-1:09:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:09:45):**  We need to have a failures forum.  Let's get together and discuss this crap that didn't work.  Right.  
**[1:09:53-1:10:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:09:53):**  And why it didn't work because sometimes that's where the most information is gleaned is by,  you know, like I don't want to sell this, this, this fantasy that, that if you do regenerative  practices, your life's going to be amazing.  
**[1:10:05-1:10:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:10:05):**  And it's all sunshine and roses, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[1:10:09-1:10:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:10:09):**  No, let's not do that because it's not, it's hard.  You got your neighbors against you.  You got people calling your husband saying, do you know what your wife is up to?  
**[1:10:16-1:10:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:10:16):**  You know, like it's crazy.  Thankfully that doesn't happen anymore.  Yeah.  
**[1:10:23-1:10:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:10:23):**  I, I haven't gotten any of those phone calls, but I don't know if people just haven't, haven't  called me and told me how, how dumb they think I am or everybody just kind of keeping it  to themselves.  
**[1:10:38-1:10:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:10:38):**  I think it's easier to, to just, just to be honest here.  I think it's easier to criticize a woman who's outspoken than a man.  I'm dealing with that all the time.  
**[1:10:53-1:11:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:10:53):**  As much as I'd like to think that that kind of stuff doesn't go on.  I know it does because I know it does.  I hear a lot of stories from CK and other women and you know, thankfully it's not so  
**[1:11:04-1:11:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:11:04):**  much the folks our age.  It's the previous generation.  It's about ready to age out.  
**[1:11:11-1:11:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:11:11):**  And if you're listening and you're part of that generation, I'm not like, you know, trying  to throw shade.  It's just, we still love you.  
**[1:11:18-1:11:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:11:18):**  It's a different, it was a different time.  It was a different, different mindset growing up, right?  Different culture.  
**[1:11:25-1:11:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:11:25):**  Yeah.  I mean, totally.  It's with all due respect to that generation because there's been, there's been some amazing  
**[1:11:33-1:11:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:11:33):**  advancements in agriculture.  We do have some great technology.  We set this foundation and it's, I think you see that every single generation.  
**[1:11:44-1:11:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:11:44):**  It's like, I was here's, here's a really poor example.  Maybe I'll edit this out.  You know, like at skinny jeans versus mom jeans, I'm looking at this younger generation,  
**[1:11:54-1:12:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:11:54):**  like what are you doing?  This is such a horrible decision when I was your age.  Like, you know, I did XYZ and life was great.  
**[1:12:01-1:12:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:12:01):**  And so I think that's where a lot of that comes in.  Brian, I'm sure you don't relate to this example at all, but it's always, as you start to  age out on a certain topic, you have to realize that the world is no longer mine.  
**[1:12:14-1:12:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:12:14):**  The world belongs to the people after me.  So let's set them up for success.  I'm not cool anymore.  
**[1:12:21-1:12:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:12:21):**  No, I think that's my realization is that like, yeah, I'm not, I'm not cool anymore.  And then just a little bit about what you said earlier.  I also didn't realize how thick my skin would have to be to be working and something a little  
**[1:12:38-1:12:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:12:38):**  bit differently.  Um, I think I get reminded frequently of how my skin is not thick and you have to have,  you have to ask yourself this question.  
**[1:12:48-1:13:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:12:48):**  Am I willing to get thicker skin and just barrel my way through and not give a shit  about anybody else?  Or am I willing to like absorb small bits of the blows, but then come back stronger  
**[1:13:01-1:13:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:13:01):**  and come back with a message that's more, that resonates more, that's humble, that has  humility, so that I bring in four or five more people versus barreling my way through  and ticking people off.  
**[1:13:15-1:13:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:13:15):**  So I ask myself that every single day.  Anyhow, the way I've looked at it the last few years, if someone is approaching me with  a criticism or with a challenge about my production practices or my ecology, that's an opportunity  
**[1:13:33-1:13:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:13:33):**  for me to do better.  That's an opportunity for me to learn how to communicate with that person better and  to better tell my story and maybe make a convert.  
**[1:13:45-1:14:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:13:45):**  Something else I've realized over the last few years, especially being active on social  media, you'll get your greatest fans, right?  And then you get some people that support you, that follow you along.  
**[1:14:02-1:14:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:14:02):**  But the haters, the ones that comment something negative on almost every post, those are the  ones I really like.  And I'll tell you why.  
**[1:14:12-1:14:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:14:12):**  Because you already get a live in their head rent free and you don't have to do anything  for it.  You just keep being yourself and those haters, you get a live in their head rent free.  
**[1:14:24-1:14:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:14:24):**  And that hater is one step away from being your biggest fan.  Oh yeah, I've seen that before.  I have seen that before.  
**[1:14:32-1:14:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:14:32):**  I've heard a story of kind of the talking head.  A friend of mine was kind of doing this kind of work and putting stuff out and there's  always this one talking head just kind of spewing negativity and just constantly.  
**[1:14:46-1:15:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:14:46):**  And then as it turns out, that individual was the biggest changer of the whole group.  And it's bizarre how that happens sometimes.  And also you're never an expert in your own hometown.  
**[1:15:00-1:15:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:15:00):**  That's another thing too.  I don't ever desire to be an expert anywhere really.  I just want to help people have conversations and help them source the information that  
**[1:15:09-1:15:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:15:09):**  they desire.  I don't go to groups that don't want to hear from me.  Like the group that asked me to come speak privately, they sought me out as an individual,  
**[1:15:20-1:15:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:15:20):**  as somebody that they had had some other experience with at other conferences.  And they placed me in that situation.  But I don't go looking to deliver messages where somebody doesn't want that message.  
**[1:15:33-1:15:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:15:33):**  And that's part of meeting people where they're at.  There's always going to be a producer in the audience no matter where you're at that's  not ready to hear your message, that's going to want to argue with everything you say.  
**[1:15:45-1:16:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:15:45):**  But if you go to a place where the context is set up right, you can set yourself up for  a lot more success just by not having those people around that are going to argue with  you, people that want to hear your message rather than trying to force feed it to them.  
**[1:16:03-1:16:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:16:03):**  And I think that guys have to come to the regenerative agriculture side, not out of  force, not because it's a stick and carrot approach, but because they want to, but because  they see the value in it and they see the ecological benefits, they see the sociological  
**[1:16:20-1:16:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:16:20):**  benefits.  That's what I think attracts people to regenerative agriculture.  Yeah, and having an open dialogue where it's hard to make change and it's hard to do  
**[1:16:33-1:16:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:16:33):**  something that might cause failure, you know, in oh gosh, maybe 2016, 2017, we put in our  first cover crop on some farm ground that we manage.  We've got 150 acres of dry land and our first cover crop coming from people who were preaching  
**[1:16:51-1:16:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:16:51):**  the benefits was a disaster.  You know, we didn't use the right species, the timing was off, you know, the management  was off.  
**[1:16:59-1:17:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:16:59):**  And so we had to go back to the drawing board and figure out how to, you know, what's our  next step for cover cropping?  You know, what did we learn from that mistake?  
**[1:17:09-1:17:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:17:09):**  And so of course you get phone calls, people drive by the field, what the hell's out in  your field right now?  It looks like a mess, you know?  
**[1:17:16-1:17:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:17:16):**  So yeah.  Must be a shitty farmer, can't even grow a good cover crop.  My husband would say it's bad for business.  
**[1:17:26-1:17:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:17:26):**  You can't have your field looking like that.  But no, I do, I see that stuff changing.  I see it shifting right now.  
**[1:17:32-1:17:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:17:32):**  I'll tell you what, Brian, I cannot even begin to put into words the massive amount of shift  we've seen in the last probably 18 months to two years.  You know, when a lot of us were talking about this four or five years ago, like I said,  
**[1:17:47-1:17:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:17:47):**  we didn't even know it was called regenerative.  Like that wasn't.  And everybody was looking at us like we were wearing tinfoil hats.  
**[1:17:54-1:18:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:17:54):**  Well, there were a few of you that did wear tinfoil hats.  I'll own that.  No, but you're exactly right.  
**[1:18:05-1:18:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:18:05):**  Like it is, but the research has to catch up.  There was a really crappy article put out today that basically said cover crops don't  work, right?  
**[1:18:16-1:18:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:18:16):**  You know, so we have to go out there and we have to address, okay, what is this message?  Where is the message accurate and where is the message inaccurate?  You know, and where's the research to support that?  
**[1:18:28-1:18:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:18:28):**  I do think producers, you know, if it comes out of research and extension, some of them  take that as gospel.  Well, the truth is research and extension is horribly underfunded.  
**[1:18:38-1:18:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:18:38):**  They're not, you know, they're not able to do systems approach multi-year studies that  can show the benefits of multiple.  And a lot of them.  
**[1:18:49-1:18:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:18:49):**  They're funded by.  Their funding a lot of times comes from big ag chemical companies that are trying to sell  you something.  
**[1:18:57-1:19:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:18:57):**  So, yeah, it's only natural that the extension is going to run a study on, okay, how do we  kill this weed?  Well, sponsored by, you know, Dow or Corteva.  
**[1:19:08-1:19:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:19:08):**  Well, strangely enough, the best way to manage that weed is to spray it with the chemical  that the company that sponsored the study makes.  Yeah, it's really interesting how that happens.  
**[1:19:22-1:19:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:19:22):**  You know, I think too, here's the thing, like, what is the economic threshold of not doing  anything?  Right.  
**[1:19:33-1:19:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:19:33):**  Like you know.  I'm thinking about old world bluestem right now and I don't know why.  For those that don't know, it's an invasive warm season grass.  
**[1:19:46-1:20:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:19:46):**  There's five different grasses that kind of fall into the old world bluestem family.  There's yellow, caucasian, ww spar, king ranch spar, and I forget the fifth one.  The funny thing about these old world bluestem grasses is back in, I think it was the 50s,  
**[1:20:05-1:20:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:20:05):**  50s or 60s, the USDA brought them over here and they bred these grasses in labs.  And they're like, oh yeah, hey, this is great stuff.  It grows anywhere.  
**[1:20:15-1:20:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:20:15):**  It spreads.  It's kill, it's drought resistant.  Okay, great.  
**[1:20:18-1:20:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:20:18):**  Sounds like a perfect grass.  Only problem is nothing wants to eat it.  There's like two weeks in September here where cows will actually go and eat it.  
**[1:20:26-1:20:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:20:26):**  The rest of the year, the other like 49 and a half weeks of the year, they just totally  ignore it.  So we create these problems.  
**[1:20:34-1:20:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:20:34):**  We breed these super grasses that are resistant to everything, allotropic, you know, they  poison the soil around them and it's kind of converting places into monoculture.  So it was probably four or five years ago, went to a talk on how to control old world  
**[1:20:53-1:21:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:20:53):**  bluestem and it was put on by extension.  And we're going through slide after slide after slide after slide.  And you know, they're talking about some non-chemical control methods like putting out blankets,  
**[1:21:07-1:21:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:21:07):**  like black plastic tarps for two years to try to kill it and use in fire and various  things.  But it was only like a three-year study and they kept going back to chemicals.  
**[1:21:20-1:21:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:21:20):**  And the two chemicals that were at the top of the charts for, you know, I'm going to  say control in quotes, was one called Arsenal and the other one was Roundup.  And Arsenal demonstrated probably 10 to 15% better control than Roundup did, especially  
**[1:21:38-1:21:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:21:38):**  on follow-up treatment.  But at the end of the talk, they weren't recommending Arsenal because the study was  funded by Monsanto who makes Roundup and wants to sell Roundup.  
**[1:21:52-1:21:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:21:52):**  So what do you think they were telling everybody to do?  They're telling everybody to spray their old world bluestem with Roundup even though it  was much less effective than Arsenal.  
**[1:21:59-1:22:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:21:59):**  Now I'm not advocating chemical use in any situation.  And I'll tell you like my anecdotal fight with old world bluestem, three years ago I  quit.  
**[1:22:13-1:22:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:22:13):**  We quit spraying it.  We'd been spraying it, trying to spray it, keep it under control and it wasn't working.  So we just quit.  
**[1:22:20-1:22:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:22:20):**  And there was a spot that was sprayed three years in a row to bare soil and we thought  we had it killed.  And now guess what's growing there?  
**[1:22:30-1:22:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:22:30):**  A few weeds and some old world bluestem.  So it's like we nuked this to bare dirt for three years to try to get rid of this plant.  And now that's all that's growing there.  
**[1:22:40-1:22:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:22:40):**  So what did we really accomplish?  I don't know.  I think that there's a lot of examples of how we got to where we're at based off of  
**[1:22:50-1:22:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:22:50):**  what you just said, Brian.  I really do.  I love that.  
**[1:22:54-1:23:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:22:54):**  I love that 1000 beating hearts film that they did with Will Harris over at Oak, White  Oak Pastures.  So, and he talks about that too.  
**[1:23:04-1:23:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:23:04):**  You know, it's hard, it's hard, but in a lot of ways we've been sold a bag of goods, you  know, that might not have taken us down the right path and unwinding that is going to  be difficult.  
**[1:23:21-1:23:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:23:21):**  I don't have all the answers.  I don't think anybody does.  I know.  
**[1:23:25-1:23:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:23:25):**  And, but that's where it makes it, it makes it so hard to figure all this out, you know.  And it's not good advice to say, you know, I've had, I've been to conferences and somebody  was like, stop your tillage 100% or stop 100% of your inputs or stop doing this, stop doing  
**[1:23:44-1:23:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:23:44):**  that.  Maybe that's actually not the best recommendation, but then how do you know if the recommendation  is coming from a sponsored talking head?  
**[1:23:54-1:24:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:23:54):**  You know, that's where we need to have independent.  We need to have, well, first of all, like I could go into my, that my, the way my technical  brain works, but there was a recent study put out, I think it was co-sponsored by Patagonia  
**[1:24:09-1:24:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:24:09):**  that said the number one barrier to the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices was  lack of trusted advisement.  Meaning that we can attend all the conferences we want to in the world, but if you, on your  
**[1:24:24-1:24:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:24:24):**  two hour drive home, if there's nobody in those zip codes between the conference and  home that can either corroborate or can help you adjust to the information that you just  learned and you go out there and you try to input something that you heard at a conference  
**[1:24:38-1:24:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:24:38):**  based off of a guy that lives in a different region, you might not find success and then  you might give up.  So how do we, how do we put back in, you know, systems where we have independent recommendations  
**[1:24:51-1:25:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:24:51):**  being given by people who don't make money off of quotas?  And yeah, what is this guy trying to sell me?  Why is he telling me to do this?  
**[1:25:02-1:25:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:25:02):**  What does, what does, what do they stand to gain if I adopt this practice or management  philosophy?  And I think that's, you know, that's why it's hard to get funding to talk about regenerative  
**[1:25:16-1:25:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:25:16):**  agriculture because, because Dow, Monsanto, Corteva, John Deere aren't going to get rich  selling a shit to do regenerative agriculture with.  You know, there's no big company that is in the sphere.  
**[1:25:31-1:25:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:25:31):**  There's no startup that's really in the sphere with a lot of money to throw around that's  got a product to sell you.  Because I think at the end of the day, regenerative practices are kind of almost the opposite  
**[1:25:43-1:25:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:25:43):**  of the corporate commoditization and the big centralization, globalization of agriculture.  It is, it is.  You know, at scale, I don't know what that looks like.  
**[1:25:54-1:26:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:25:54):**  I heard through the grapevine, another independent consultant.  And I say that about myself, you know, I work in communications and content, so that doesn't,  I'm not implying that I'm a, you know, agronomist or crop consultant, but one of my colleagues  
**[1:26:10-1:26:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:26:10):**  was telling me that she was approached recently by a major retailer and that the gist of the  conversation is that they were wanting to turn into services.  They wanted to make sure that they were offering services to producers because they understood  
**[1:26:29-1:26:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:26:29):**  that if things go the way that it might be predicted for the way that the climate looks,  or the way that maybe government programs look, that there's going to be a reduction  in the amount of inputs that will be needed to farm in the future.  
**[1:26:44-1:27:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:26:44):**  So how do they make those adjustments to be able to offer services and education, which  I actually, I found that to be very promising.  And to think that if this is actually going to change business models, that's the only  
**[1:27:00-1:27:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:27:00):**  way this, and I'm optimistic that we can do that favorably for the producer.  I don't know.  Time, we shall see.  
**[1:27:08-1:27:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:27:08):**  Time will tell if my optimistic rings true.  Well, I want to try to hang on to some of that optimism.  I think that's our only choice.  
**[1:27:20-1:27:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:27:20):**  We have to hang on to the optimism and we have to keep moving forward on the only path  that a lot of us see as the only way forward.  So kind of heading to wrap this up, I know we all have stuff to get out and get doing  
**[1:27:38-1:27:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:27:38):**  today.  Any thoughts you kind of want to end with?  Anything we left on the table?  
**[1:27:44-1:28:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:27:44):**  No, I mean, I think this has been a great conversation.  I appreciate you, CK and Brian, because what you guys are doing is you're putting information  out there and it has a lot of variety for people to digest.  
**[1:28:02-1:28:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:28:02):**  And so thank you for allowing me to come on here.  Thank you for allowing me to have a few rabbit holes with you and go down this.  But I just think it's going to take a lot of different thought processors and a lot  
**[1:28:17-1:28:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:28:17):**  of different brain power.  And like Brian, you mentioned earlier, what we're witnessing right now is a shift in energy.  There's a huge shift in energy happening globally.  
**[1:28:29-1:28:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:28:29):**  I read an article about, I think it was called The Great Resignation, where people, there's  employee shortages, but there's also people that are thinking to themselves, I am a part  of a mechanical corporate structure right now that doesn't supply my body, my family,  
**[1:28:49-1:29:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:28:49):**  my four walls with what I need to survive.  And so people are willing to change and do something drastically different.  So I think we're in the middle of that change is hard, change is messy.  
**[1:29:00-1:29:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:29:00):**  It's bloody, it's a glory.  It's filled with aha moments of bliss and aha moments of just like pure panic.  And I've been there over the last 18 months too, but I just think in closing, we're witnessing  
**[1:29:15-1:29:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:29:15):**  something that's never happened before.  We're witnessing a massive shift in thought processes.  And I hope that this massive shift goes into actual changes at the farm level so that when  
**[1:29:31-1:29:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:29:31):**  the history books are written, when my kids and my grandkids are talking about things  that they've witnessed in their life, they're like, well, my mom or my grandma or my dad  stood to do something different, to get out of the status quo.  
**[1:29:49-1:30:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:29:49):**  And so that's where my great hope lies is that we're doing these things right now so  that in the future, we've actually made change.  The result of COVID is that people said enough is enough.  
**[1:30:03-1:30:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:30:03):**  Let's get some stuff figured out and let's make some real positive changes.  I think that's good too.  I think our goal is kind of aligned with what your goal is too with this podcast and just  
**[1:30:18-1:30:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:30:18):**  cultivating conversations.  That's where we want to start.  And if that creates people with an impact of wanting to continue to talk about that  
**[1:30:27-1:30:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:30:27):**  and learn more about how they can just do small changes in their own life, that's kind  of the success we want to have with our goals.  Yeah.  
**[1:30:37-1:30:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:30:37):**  What is the quote?  I'm going to butcher it.  If you want to see small changes, change the way you do things.  
**[1:30:45-1:30:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:30:45):**  If you want to make big changes, change the way you think about them.  Yeah.  So where can we find you, Jess?  
**[1:30:54-1:31:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:30:54):**  Check me out on LinkedIn, Jessica Madd.  Also check me out on Great Plains Regeneration website.  It's greatplainsregion.org.  
**[1:31:05-1:31:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:31:05):**  And we'll have some events coming up in the next couple months.  And you can find me at Fuller Field School next week.  We're supporting Gail Fuller and his handle is just fullerfieldschool.com.  
**[1:31:20-1:31:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:31:20):**  And yeah, just keep on keeping on everybody.  We're doing some cool stuff.  This will probably come out after Gail's school, but Gail's a good guy.  
**[1:31:30-1:31:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:31:30):**  We need to get him on the podcast one of these days.  Yeah, you do.  Yeah.  
**[1:31:35-1:31:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:31:35):**  But so that's a...  We'll probably do two or three more of those Fuller Field Schools.  The goal and one thing that we're working on right now is turning that into a land leadership  
**[1:31:49-1:32:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:31:49):**  system to where we're doing some fully immersive field schools, not field days, actual field  schools.  And so that's kind of an exciting part of the future that we have with Great Plains  
**[1:32:02-1:32:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:32:02):**  Generation.  Well, good deal.  Good deal.  
**[1:32:07-1:32:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:32:07):**  Well, Jess, it's been great.  And like I said, I think we all have things we need to get on with and get on with our  day.  
**[1:32:15-1:32:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:32:15):**  Really want to thank you for joining us today and look forward to many more conversations  in the future.  It was my pleasure.  
**[1:32:22-1:32:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:32:22):**  Thank you, CK and Brian.  Thank you.  All right, guys, have a good day and we'll catch you later.  
**[1:32:29-1:32:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/38-Jessica-Gnad-Regeneration-2-0-e19tdiv#t=1:32:29):**  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.

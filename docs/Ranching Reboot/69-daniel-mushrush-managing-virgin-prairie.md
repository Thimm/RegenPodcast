Daniel Mushrush from Mushrush Red Angus is here to tell us about some of the why about  
**[0:01:12-0:01:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:01:12):**  why he wants to manage his cows with Vint's collars and what he hopes to be able to accomplish.  So Daniel, welcome to the show.  Yeah, we finally got it done.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:01:22):**  Yeah, yeah.  So let's start off, tell us, Daniel Mushrush, tell us a little bit about yourself and where  you're at.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:01:29):**  Yeah, I guess first thing if people hear me gasp and wheeze and cough, I do have COVID  at the moment.  So I'll try to edit some of those out.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:01:39):**  I apologize ahead of time for that.  But I guess above and beyond the immediate, kind of the bigger picture, Mushrush Ranches  is a multi-generation ranch, we're in the Flint Hills of Kansas, we're right in the  
**[0:01:55-0:02:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:01:55):**  middle of Chase County, if you know where that is.  You're just up the road from the Hoy family.  Yeah, we'd be neighbors, really, we'd be neighbors.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:02:04):**  So we kind of have a multi-prong story.  We've been in the area a long time in the present, I'm kind of the third generation  of the ranch in its current form.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:02:18):**  How did your family get to the Flint Hills?  We walked here after the Civil War.  So that's fun.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:02:24):**  There's a really neat story.  There's several brothers and it's really, the whole story is kind of a tale of whoa.  They showed up on a boat as young boys with their parents and their uncle.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:02:39):**  They arrived at Ellis Island.  They lost the uncle, never to be seen or heard from again.  They ended up in Wisconsin and after being there for a couple years, the parents got  
**[0:02:51-0:03:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:02:51):**  sick and died.  So the three brothers, one or two were all were underage.  Actually they did the whole trick of, they rode 18 on their shoe and then said, they  
**[0:03:04-0:03:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:03:04):**  were over 18 and they got into the army just because they had nothing to, no reason to  go.  Yeah.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:03:13):**  So one of those brothers died, the other two got a land, received land in Chase County  for fighting for a regiment in Wisconsin.  And so they walked to Chase County and set up shop and eventually wrote back and got  
**[0:03:32-0:03:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:03:32):**  their wives and had them come in.  And we've been kind of doing some history of those guys.  And even then it was kind of interesting because you can read it just clear as day to day that  
**[0:03:44-0:03:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:03:44):**  one of them was kind of responsible and held down the fort and kind of built the family  operation and kind of tried to keep it together.  And the other one would, he'd go up and fight Indians and shoot Buffalo.  
**[0:03:56-0:04:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:03:56):**  He was kind of the, he kind of had the wild hair, the two of them.  But from those guys, from Francis, the more responsible one, I guess he would have been  my great, great, great grandfather.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:04:11):**  He was on the west side of Chase County.  They slowly kind of put that place together.  And then in the kind of in the 50s around that time, my great grandfather, God bless  
**[0:04:23-0:04:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:04:23):**  his heart, was a hypochondriac and pretty much sold out and moved to town to die and  lived until he was, I think, 93 or 94 and died in the 90s.  And so we kind of got to start over again.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:04:42):**  And when we when we restarted there, my grandfather bought kind of some land that was kind of  over around Elmdale between Elmdale and Cottonwood Falls.  About what year was that?  
**[0:04:52-0:05:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:04:52):**  Oh, that'd been in the 50s.  He came home from the Korean War then and started and started kind of doing this.  Okay.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:05:00):**  I'm just trying to make sure I'm following along here.  Yep.  Yep.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:05:03):**  So so grandpa came and he actually worked at the bank for years.  So he he wasn't he had a little bit of ground, but he wasn't full time ranching at all.  If anything, you know, he kind of did the I mean, he sacrificed working in town.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:05:17):**  So so dad could have a shot at it.  And grandma was was really active day to day.  Dad came home from he graduated K State in 1980 and came back to the farm, which, of  
**[0:05:32-0:05:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:05:32):**  course, if anybody knows, maybe start first year.  Yeah, about the worst year you probably could have picked if you wanted to graduate from  college and come home and start farming the ranching.  
**[0:05:43-0:06:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:05:43):**  And so he and mom came back in 1980 and kind of scrabbled through those times.  And then I had a bunch of us kids and and I guess kind of fast forward to present day.  Now it's my mom and dad are here, do dated, you know, still daily work.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:06:04):**  My wife and I are employed full time.  And then I have two brothers, Cole and Chris, who are all back.  And so no outside help, still very much a family business.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:06:17):**  No outside money coming in.  We're, we're kind of making a go at it in the cattle industry.  Good stuff.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:06:24):**  On the genetic side, we everything we do is is kind of  through the through the red Angus vein, I guess, if you will, we don't have any row  crops.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:06:36):**  We were kind of diversified and that we have some stalkers, we have a commercial bread  heifer project.  Mainly those two things.  
**[0:06:44-0:07:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:06:44):**  They satisfy a couple different needs, I guess, whether it's filling extra grass or being  able to buy customer calves or even sell selling commercial heifers.  And then kind of the main the main component of the business is there's around 750 registered  
**[0:07:01-0:07:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:07:01):**  red Angus cows that are split spring and fall.  And they kind of keep us keep us pretty busy.  We were doing embryo work this morning.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:07:10):**  We'll be pulling cedars tonight.  But that's kind of the good and the good and bad about a two season deal like that is it  works really well on paper because you're always busy.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:07:22):**  And then the downside of having two herds of any sort of size and only a family operation  is you're always busy.  And so we're kind of working on that at the moment.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:07:33):**  But that's kind of, you know, that's a quick and dirty.  I guess that's that's kind of kind of where we're at today, I guess.  Okay, so what's your story?  
**[0:07:43-0:07:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:07:43):**  How did you how did you get back to the farm?  Yeah, um, or branch?  I'm sorry.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:07:49):**  Right.  Yeah.  I should go better.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:07:56):**  My story is, um, grew up went to K State.  No, hold that against you.  I mean, we didn't know I didn't know there was other colleges until I was several years  
**[0:08:08-0:08:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:08:08):**  removed on us.  It was it was where I needed to go.  And so went up there had a had a great time.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:08:19):**  I can't, I can't fight it.  I mean, I really I think I was lucky to be.  I was lucky to be in Manhattan at a really good time.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:08:28):**  And that even now when I'm when I'm removed, you know, longer now I want to admit 15 years  or so now I guess, you know, I'm starting to look back and the people that I was really  good friends with K State are starting to make a difference in the industry starting  
**[0:08:43-0:08:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:08:43):**  to see people do things and maybe even outside of the industry, doing things in other areas  that I was in a really good time to surround myself with a lot of people who forced me  to be better, I guess for lack of a better word.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:08:59):**  And so that was a great experience.  Obviously met my wife there, which was a cherry on top.  That's a good got done, got done with that.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:09:12):**  Worked briefly at Cargill.  I went into the cattle buying program.  One of the many benefits that I picked up at K State was I got fluent in Spanish.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:09:24):**  And so cattle buying kind of got sidetracked to operations in Dodge City.  And if you want to get right down to it, I prefer to keep them alive and kill them.  I mean, I know that's where they all end up.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:09:40):**  But that's just not where I wanted to be.  I'm with you on that.  I would much rather see them alive, fat and happy in the pasture.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:09:48):**  Yeah, it just wasn't where I wanted to be.  That being said, I wasn't quite ready to come home yet.  I just I was still young, filling my oats.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:09:58):**  And I went from there to I was actually a commodity broker for several years in Amarillo,  Texas.  And that was really invaluable.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:10:07):**  That was valuable.  Sorry.  That was that was a that was a really great experience in terms of not only now marketing  
**[0:10:15-0:10:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:10:15):**  risk doing some different things on the ranch, but just how to think about how to think about  agriculture as industry, how to, you know, real money decisions, you know, marginal decisions,  you know, lots of concepts flying at you at 100 different ways and some things that I  
**[0:10:35-0:10:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:10:35):**  still kind of live and die on that might frustrate even some people at some point.  But that was a good experience.  We had a kid while we were there.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:10:45):**  Our first born Sadie was born in Texas.  And at that point, it was that was time to come home.  You know, we liked Amarillo, but it wasn't where we wanted to raise a family.  
**[0:10:57-0:11:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:10:57):**  And so we moved back about 12 years ago, I guess.  And we've been we had three more kids after that.  And we've been building the cow herd and we haven't looked back.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:11:09):**  So that's kind of my background, I guess, is, is, yeah, not not a lot, you know, just  kind of grew up in the Flint Hills.  I guess, hopefully, like in any sort of ranching deal, I guess, hopefully enough white collar  
**[0:11:29-0:11:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:11:29):**  work that I am smart enough not to go broke, but enough blue collar experience that I'm  not, don't have a silver spoon in my mouth, and I can go out there and get dirty and make  it happen.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:11:38):**  That's a fun balance, isn't it?  It actually is.  It's actually one I kind of enjoy.  
**[0:11:45-0:12:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:11:45):**  But that's, yeah, that's, that's where we're at, I guess.  So let's talk about ranching in the Flint Hills a little bit.  I mean, most of what I think of when I hear ranching in the Flint Hills is burn it the  
**[0:12:02-0:12:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:12:02):**  first burn it about the 10th, the 15th of April, turn out seven to 10 days later, double  stock with yearlings for 90 to 100 days, and then get them out of there and go to Florida.  How are you different?  
**[0:12:17-0:12:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:12:17):**  I'm about different and all of that actually.  Is that the way most of the Flint Hills works?  Yeah.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:12:26):**  So, the thing that a lot of people confuse about the Flint Hills is, is they think, you  know, well, it's great grass, what must be great grass year round.  For everybody who's not familiar with this, this area, I guess I'll back it up.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:12:41):**  So if somebody doesn't know where the Flint Hills are, it's a narrow strip in Kansas,  kind of on the east side, runs from border to border.  There's some people in Oklahoma that think they have some too.  
**[0:12:54-0:13:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:12:54):**  Well, I guess for being diplomatic, we'll say that the Flint Hills go in Oklahoma as  well.  It's some of the original tall grass native prairie left in the country.  
**[0:13:06-0:13:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:13:06):**  Of the original tall grass, most of it was broken out.  Only 2% remain.  Of that 2%, around 90 plus percent of that is now for the Flint Hills.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:13:18):**  The only reason it wasn't broke out is because the ground was just too rocky.  It just didn't allow them to break it out at that time.  So it stayed in its Virgin Prairie state.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:13:27):**  Another big chunk of undisturbed native prairie is the Red Hills where I'm at.  That's right.  That's right.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:13:34):**  I've actually kind of learned a little bit about those with the GPGI deal the last couple  of years.  And the remainder, like the little tiny bit that's not in the Flint Hills or the Red  
**[0:13:44-0:14:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:13:44):**  Hills is up at the Smoky Hills.  And it wasn't farmed because a lot of it's not flat enough to be farmed.  And it's way, way too rocky to even try to think about pulling any kind of an implement  
**[0:14:00-0:14:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:14:00):**  through.  And even building fences is kind of an issue in that area with all the rocks in the soil,  right?  
**[0:14:07-0:14:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:14:07):**  Yep.  I always tell people that we have rock bits for T-posts.  And a lot of parts of the world don't think like they've never even heard of such a thing.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:14:18):**  But it's something that we are pretty familiar with.  You knock the spade off, you kind of have a smooth bore, you drill it out there and  you smash the post in and there you go.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:14:26):**  And you move on to the next rock and you rinse and repeat.  So yeah, it's a tough part of the world to do improvements, I guess sometimes.  But going back to the cattle side of it, what you said is really how it's been for a long  
**[0:14:41-0:14:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:14:41):**  time.  The grass is really good.  And a lot of people know that the, you know, hear stories about how good the grass is.  
**[0:14:49-0:15:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:14:49):**  The grass is really good for May, June and July.  And then it kind of, I always tell people that kind of works like wheat pasture.  While it's green, it looks really good.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:15:01):**  When that stuff turns off, it really starts falling apart on us.  And it just doesn't cure on the stem at all.  It just doesn't hold any value.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:15:10):**  So by the time we get to kind of the first of the year, second of the year, we're going  to be sub 5% protein on that grass.  Whereas you know, right now, gosh, we're probably 18.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:15:22):**  And a month ago, it was five.  Right.  Right.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:15:30):**  And so we go from, we go from, from 18 to five.  And from.  That's pretty quick, I mean, in terms of, you know, 100 days, it just doesn't, it doesn't  
**[0:15:43-0:15:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:15:43):**  give you a lot of time to, to, to get anything done.  So this, this part of the world became stalker country, kind of, you know, stop over originally  from the Texans bringing cattle up and then shipping them on.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:15:58):**  And there's, there's a whole robber baron history in Chase County that's kind of interesting.  But those big landowners kind of got a hold of this, of a lot of these pieces of ground  and a lot of these are, a lot of these are big even today.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:16:12):**  I mean, they're still, they're still big kind of expanses that were put together from those  times.  But where that 100 day grazing season works, because that grass is so good is there's a,  
**[0:16:27-0:16:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:16:27):**  maybe a missed notion that you must take some animals that are really, really good and put  them on, put them on that grass and then those really good cattle become exceptional cattle  in that short amount of time.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:16:41):**  I don't think that works.  And really, really what the bread and butter of the Flint Hills is to take bad cattle and  make them average.  
**[0:16:51-0:17:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:16:51):**  Okay.  And, and that's really when that's where the, you know, you'll see a lot of flyweight Mexican  types that are, you know, commingled, you know, brought in every color under the sun.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:17:04):**  I don't even want to know how many PI carriers are probably running around.  Cattle that if they would have gone straight to a feed yard would probably assuredly have  died.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:17:13):**  High risk types.  A lot of high risk cattle, but you can get those high risk cattle in here and the grass  will just straighten them out.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:17:23):**  And as if you've ever kind of had those, those sorts picked off on you at a sale barn before  and you know how insane it can make you and somebody sits in there all day and buys them  at 30, $40, a hundred at a discount.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:17:35):**  And you know, some of them they get us and we're all mad about, and there's some of them  we let them have, right?  There's some of them you're like, yeah, I mean, that's right.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:17:43):**  They take a lot of those cattle and they turn them out in the Flint Hills and they get okay.  And there's a margin to be had by taking bad and making it average in the cattle market.  So that's kind of what the Flint Hills do.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:17:59):**  So where do I fit in then being the registered guy with the full year round cows in the middle  of this country, I don't fit at all.  So you're kind of a typical ranching reboot podcast guest.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:18:16):**  That's right.  The neighbors at all.  We don't fit in.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:18:19):**  We just don't fit in very well.  So why are we doing it in the first place?  I guess there's that, you know, well, it worked for us because nobody else was doing it, I  
**[0:18:32-0:18:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:18:32):**  guess is kind of a good way to when dad started it.  Because there was a niche to be had there.  I think there in a broader sense, what we're doing, there is a niche and there's still,  
**[0:18:45-0:18:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:18:45):**  we can talk about that later.  But so all of what we just talked about, and not even so much the May months, you know,  May, June, July, this time of year, this really doesn't define, in my opinion, what our operation  
**[0:18:58-0:19:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:18:58):**  does.  Because I could take any animal, any animal of any size of any age, and put it on our  ranch right now.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:19:07):**  And it would, I'd look like I knew what I was doing.  It's making it through the winter.  The months that define our program really start about Thanksgiving and go to about March,  
**[0:19:20-0:19:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:19:20):**  in my opinion, really, probably more like October.  You know, there are a handful of commercial cows here, there.  And a lot of those will be, you know, guys will start supplementing about middle of October.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:19:36):**  I like to be 45 days after that.  A lot of people will want to be supplementing, you know, right up until about May 1.  I try to quit about a month before that.  
**[0:19:46-0:20:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:19:46):**  And so a lot of these cow costs, because we are supplementing energy and protein at the  same time, if we weren't careful with the sort of cow we had, we would be broke.  In fact, go ahead.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:20:00):**  What are you supplementing with?  What's your winter feed program, if you don't mind sharing?  I'm an opportunist.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:20:06):**  Okay.  So it doesn't look, it doesn't look the same year to year.  Is it mainly a cost criteria or you like, you know, I don't want to do this no grain  
**[0:20:18-0:20:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:20:18):**  program.  I only want to do alfalfa or...  I usually don't do a lot of grain because of cost, but it's not that I have a, I don't  
**[0:20:28-0:20:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:20:28):**  have any moral qualms.  I'm not a, you know, I'm really good friends with a lot of Argentines and I actually am  on a WhatsApp group with them that's called grass lovers and it's actually the English  
**[0:20:39-0:20:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:20:39):**  grass lovers and they always tell me that they're taking my grass lovers license away  from me because I'll say something about, you know, well, why don't you just do this?  You know, and I'm like, you lost your license, buddy.  
**[0:20:49-0:21:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:20:49):**  Then they give it back and I say something else, but, and that's kind of where I feel  a lot of these conversations that are, you know, these, you know, regenerative or whatever  it is, I'm in the system, but at the same time, there's a lot of times I feel like I  
**[0:21:05-0:21:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:21:05):**  maybe embrace the science before I embrace the dogma and sometimes when I don't quite  embrace the dogma, I don't quite get let into the club.  But...  
**[0:21:17-0:21:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:21:17):**  I think that's kind of an interesting point.  You know, I was thinking about, you mentioned regenerative and I don't think there's a lot  of gatekeeping in the regenerative ag community.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:21:30):**  Like you were talking about maybe in your, in your grass, Argentine grass lovers club,  which, which sounds cool, I might have to hit you up for an invite to that group because  that just sounds like a cool group to be in.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:21:39):**  They're a fun group of people.  Oh crap, I forgot what I was going to say.  Gatekeeping.  
**[0:21:48-0:22:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:21:48):**  Gatekeeping and, and, and trying to keep people out or saying, well, you're not regenerative  because you do this.  Well, okay.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:22:00):**  We can't, we can't exclude people.  We got to meet.  We got to be meeting them where they are.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:22:05):**  I, my, my worry about what I see in, like I said, I'm still a member, I guess, a practicing  member, I guess, but where I, what I get tripped up with and I get worried about is sometimes  there's so much further fervor for what we're doing, that in absence of actual hard data,  
**[0:22:26-0:22:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:22:26):**  we will kind of sub out, like I said, dogma, you know, well, you know, if it shouldn't,  like, you know, it's supposed to be this way.  It should be this way, you know, and I think there's, you know, the empirical data will  
**[0:22:39-0:22:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:22:39):**  get there and it probably would be more chances for empirical data.  People would actually measure more on their own operations.  And I think we're probably lacking in the year 2022.  
**[0:22:50-0:23:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:22:50):**  But that's what I get a little worried about, I guess, on that.  I see, you know, people follow dogma because it's an easy way to distill a very complex  subject or complex concept down to just a few simple words that can be remembered.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:23:10):**  But sometimes that meaning, you know, that, that, what should be a very simple, elegant  thing, like my favorite is shake the hand that feeds you, I guess you could call that  part of my dogma.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:23:21):**  You know, sometimes they have to be pretty carefully crafted.  So you can't take and twist those words and people, you know, start thinking they mean  other things than they do.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:23:32):**  And I don't have a specific example of that, but that kind of goes along with the gatekeeping.  You know, we need to stay, be inclusive and not get tied up into a lot of dogma, but be  willing to keep educating and learning.  
**[0:23:48-0:23:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:23:48):**  Yep.  I think that's fair.  I think that's fair.  
**[0:23:53-0:23:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:23:53):**  But anyway, where were we?  Oh, yeah.  So what are we doing on winter feed?  
**[0:23:57-0:24:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:23:57):**  That's the first thing I do on winter supplementation.  And I try to keep everything simple.  And I try to touch the cows as little as I can.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:24:09):**  Because there's only a handful of us, like we mentioned, and we have too much going on  as it is.  When you say touch, are you meaning just bring them into the corrals and do things?  
**[0:24:18-0:24:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:24:18):**  I mean, human interaction with a single cow.  I mean, you know, I try to individual attention, individual attention, one of the things that  we value the most on our ranch is time.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:24:29):**  Because it's one of the things we have the least of, and you can't get any more.  And we can't I mean, the reason we're bringing siblings back in because nobody else will  work the hours for the pay that we're that we're providing in the list of lousy benefits.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:24:44):**  I mean, you know, we're, we're not going to get to hire anybody at what are what we're  offering.  But because of that our own time is valuable to us.  
**[0:24:53-0:25:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:24:53):**  And so like the through through Christmas through the first of the year, if I can, I'm  a big believer of biorette, simple product, put it in the mineral.  You know, the good thing about this Plent Hills is pretty easy to kind of leave a stockpile  
**[0:25:09-0:25:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:25:09):**  of fall grazing, if you will let that grass grow ahead of you.  One of the best things I like to do is get on the grass late.  And that grass is already I'm already behind it and so I'm chasing it all year it grows  
**[0:25:20-0:25:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:25:20):**  ahead of me gets rank.  Well then I put the biorette out we eat it back down.  Pretty simple.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:25:25):**  That works until we're short on energy.  About the first of the year we run out of energy.  And then we'll have to go to hay.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:25:33):**  Like I'll make a put up a little hay this year, because I'm scared to death on what  the costs are going to be.  Well, yeah.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:25:43):**  You know, a couple years ago, we had a real weird event here and none of the corn plants  pollinated.  It just got really hot and dry the week they did.  
**[0:25:51-0:26:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:25:51):**  So there's a bunch of standing standing corn plants.  So I put up three or four years of corn silage that year.  And it was cornless silage.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:26:00):**  But that's why I say I'm a bit of an opportunist.  I mean, whatever, whatever the deal is at the time.  That's what I'll that's what I'll feed, I guess.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:26:13):**  I don't know where to hide this year.  That's my worry.  The other thing we're doing that's maybe makes people scratch their heads, but it's working  
**[0:26:22-0:26:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:26:22):**  really well.  Three years ago, we started transitioning a bunch of bottom land ground back into perennial  forage.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:26:32):**  Okay.  Like this is right on Highway 50.  That was farmed and farmed out?  
**[0:26:37-0:26:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:26:37):**  Yeah, this was this was this was farmed for for years and years.  And if anybody's curious, it's right on Highway 50 if they've driven by.  So the good and bad is if this blew up in our face, everybody was going to know.  
**[0:26:50-0:27:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:26:50):**  Now that I I'd make the argument that it's that it is successful.  Anybody can drive by and see it for themselves because it's 400 acres right on one of the  most traveled roads in the state of Kansas, just right there.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:27:06):**  Next time I go up 50, I'll blow the Clement's turn and I'll come up there because it's just  a few more miles.  They'd be like, yeah, it'd be it'd be just right up the way.  
**[0:27:15-0:27:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:27:15):**  And so why?  Why cool season?  You know, we get that question a lot, like on the regenerative side or some of the carbon  
**[0:27:21-0:27:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:27:21):**  capture side of things we're doing, you know, why not Eastern Gamma or some of those, you  know, deep rooted natives?  You know, I already have plenty of deep rooted natives.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:27:30):**  You don't have cool season protein.  That's exactly that's exactly why is, you know, we rent and own around 15,000 acres  of native acres currently.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:27:41):**  And with the addition of this, I think I'm up to like 600 of cool season.  So I just I still don't have enough.  But with it, what what is on it is is I'll do a comment in the fall.  
**[0:27:54-0:28:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:27:54):**  It's always wet cows, young, young fall bred cows.  It's the only way of all cow work here.  But it really made a cool thing.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:28:04):**  We've always had a fall herd.  But why did we have it?  It was because our customers demanded an 18 month old bull.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:28:10):**  It was a customer service issue.  And that's a lot of the things that we do when we look at a business decision.  Being in the registered business, in a way we're direct to consumer.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:28:23):**  A customer told me that a couple of years ago, and it really, I never thought of it  that way.  I can't.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:28:29):**  He does kind of what you're doing, you know, he sells beef.  He actually has a bunch of pastured eggs.  He does a lot of the shake the hand that feeds you, which I think is awesome.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:28:45):**  He was really involved in that.  He buys his bulls from us.  And I told him I had a couple questions about it, how he was handling that and how he dealt  
**[0:28:55-0:29:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:28:55):**  with, you know, just learning about his business.  And he said, well, you're already in it.  I said, well, what do you mean?  
**[0:29:01-0:29:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:29:01):**  He said, well, you're direct to consumer.  He said, your consumer is the guy who's buying your bulls.  You're direct consumer.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:29:06):**  And you've been in direct to consumer ag for longer than anybody.  And it's a good thought exercise, I guess, when he told me that and how you think about  that.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:29:21):**  But it kind of helped connect some dots.  And one of them was this was we always had a fall herd in Flint Hills, which was on paper  stupid.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:29:32):**  You had more feed costs, obviously, the calves, you'd put a bunch of feed into them and they'd,  you know, you'd wean 400 pound calves off of 900 pound cows at the end of the year,  because everybody was just in bad shape, and treatments and everything.  
**[0:29:47-0:29:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:29:47):**  It just it was a square peg and around hole.  But we did it because the customer demanded an 18 month old bull.  A lot of our bulls, sorry about that.  
**[0:29:58-0:30:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:29:58):**  A lot of our bulls go to hard parts of the country.  And it's because of the genetics and the delivery.  But you know, it's not uncommon for bulls to go to New Mexico where it's 100 acres to  
**[0:30:11-0:30:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:30:11):**  a pair, four, five or six cows a section type stuff.  Is that what you're calling harder country like New Mexico, Mountain West?  Yeah, there's a combination.  
**[0:30:22-0:30:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:30:22):**  There's that there's kind of the cap rock up in there.  And then, you know, I also put into that category and our bulls go there a lot of times is that  central and south Missouri where the Kentucky 31 just hotter than a pistol.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:30:33):**  And you know, and yeah, it has some times that it's good, but you know, nobody I don't  think is going to say that, you know, South Central Missouri in August on hot Kentucky  31 is a very good place to be a cow.  
**[0:30:47-0:30:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:30:47):**  And so those areas that have those prolonged where an animal is going to have to gut it  out and work.  That's where those were those animals kind of where those those cattle go.  
**[0:30:59-0:31:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:30:59):**  But oh, geez, I got on a tangent again.  I'm so sorry.  We're talking about winter feeding.  
**[0:31:06-0:31:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:31:06):**  Winter feeding.  So that's what what and this is the first year I've done it and I'm super excited about  it.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:31:14):**  We have enough fescue now into production that I have a set of fall cows that I've been  able to you know, they they went on to fescue a stockpile on November one.  They went all the way around till a little bit after Valentine's Day and I ran out of  
**[0:31:32-0:31:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:31:32):**  stockpile just because I don't have enough.  At that point, we did have to feed them kind of hay and a little bit of distillers, which  was not fun by the end of it.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:31:45):**  But then we were able to kind of early turn out because we didn't burn because we didn't  need to gain.  And so we turned out and then kind of went back into a supplementing protein.  
**[0:31:53-0:32:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:31:53):**  But those cattle got a little thin in April, May, but that was okay.  It started raining again.  And I have not weaned those calves yet.  
**[0:32:01-0:32:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:32:01):**  And I won't wean them until kind of the middle of July.  And so what we used to do was we would have those fall cows would get just obesity fat  when they went to this Flint Hills grass dry.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:32:13):**  Why did we put them out on the grasses?  It was still the cheapest place that we can put the cow.  You know, we couldn't, we couldn't put her out there and feed her anything less.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:32:20):**  I mean, it was, we could have probably put her in a better body condition by feeding  her in a dry lot, but it would cost more money.  And so she went out and just got pig fat.  
**[0:32:31-0:32:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:32:31):**  My hope is we can transfer a little bit of that onto the calf.  You know, if we can keep 300 pounds off the cow but put 200 pounds of it back into the  calf weaned July, we'll actually just leave those calves and those pastures, pull those  
**[0:32:44-0:32:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:32:44):**  cows back to their calving pastures.  And I'm going to have a bunch of fall calves that'll be 13 months old before I ever have  to put a bite of feed into them.  
**[0:32:53-0:33:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:32:53):**  Yeah, yeah.  And especially, you know, the heifers are good for me because it's just a, it's, it's  the old Burke Teicher trick of, you know, cheap heifer development, just do them for  
**[0:33:03-0:33:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:33:03):**  as cheap as you can run them all through the system, see how it falls.  And I've, we've done that for a lot of years and I'm a big believer in that.  And so it fits that model really well.  
**[0:33:13-0:33:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:33:13):**  The bulls, we're going to be able to, I think build a pretty good product just because those  bulls have just been out on native, you know, got the, right now they kind of have their  own creep feeder and babysitter built into one, I guess with mom because they're, you  
**[0:33:27-0:33:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:33:27):**  know, they don't need that milk at this point, but it kind of goes back to where, where can  I do it cheaper and get a better return?  I mean, they're on, they're on grass.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:33:37):**  I mean, I can't do it for less than what I'm doing it.  And then I'll leave them on there and then we won't start feeding them until, you know,  kind of later into the winter months and kind of, kind of get them kind of sale ready, but  
**[0:33:50-0:34:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:33:50):**  they'll be, they'll just be a better, you know, they'll be harder boned.  They'll be just more developed, the rumen will be more developed.  There'll just be a better product and that'll make us look better one on selling the bulls  
**[0:34:01-0:34:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:34:01):**  and two, we won't have as many problems.  And so I'm pretty excited about that.  So that's what we do on the feed.  
**[0:34:10-0:34:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:34:10):**  We do also have a grow yard that we have that we'll still take some yearlings in and they  just kind of get the little 33 meg, 30 meg, you know, standard Flint Hills, you know,  two pounds of distiller and the absolute cheapest junk hay you can find and everything gains  
**[0:34:28-0:34:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:34:28):**  a quarter pound a day if they can possibly eat enough of it.  You know, we do a little bit of that ourselves too, just because of where we're at.  I, you know, I can't, I'm still stubborn as anybody, I guess, in the Flint Hills is we're  
**[0:34:43-0:34:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:34:43):**  going to have yearlings because we live here.  Why not?  I mean, we just can't help it.  
**[0:34:47-0:35:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:34:47):**  Every time I go to the Flint Hills, I hear a story from the Hoy's or one of their other  friends that I just kind of go, okay, so that's how y'all do it over here.  It's not how we do it at home.  
**[0:35:01-0:35:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:35:01):**  This community is a tough nut to crack.  I love it.  It's full of quirky people and characters and it has been forever and it's to our detriment  
**[0:35:13-0:35:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:35:13):**  sometimes but also to our success.  You know, I'd argue that it's still the reason there's no trees in the Flint Hills and we've  put ourselves in a good position from a biological standpoint because when everybody else kind  
**[0:35:26-0:35:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:35:26):**  of in the country quit burning because K-State told them it was bad and the city started  leaning on them.  You know, there was still a bunch of guys in the Flint Hills that kind of went out with  
**[0:35:36-0:35:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:35:36):**  both fingers in the air and a six-pack of beer and would get on the open range roads  and burn 50, 60, 70,000 acres and a lot of those fires are still happening today, honestly,  but it's a quirky place.  
**[0:35:51-0:36:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:35:51):**  We can talk a little bit about burning culture in the Flint Hills and why it's a good thing.  Some of the stories that I've heard, I can definitely believe that they happen over there,  right?  
**[0:36:07-0:36:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:36:07):**  But I can also kind of see some of it here in my area happening and go, no, that just  wouldn't work here because of the way land is broken up and different landowners that  are historically opposed to fire and have been for 60 years because we don't have as  
**[0:36:26-0:36:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:36:26):**  widespread of a burning culture as y'all do.  But on the other hand, I feel like we're quite a bit more organized on the burns that we  do.  
**[0:36:35-0:36:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:36:35):**  We're not just a couple of guys that grab a case of beer and a fire stick or a drip  torch and go blast down county roads having a good time.  We have a plan.  
**[0:36:43-0:37:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:36:43):**  We have a prescription.  We're all involved, I'd say at this point, we're morphing a little bit that I'm on some  that are really pretty well organized and you kind of know what you're doing and then  
**[0:37:01-0:37:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:37:01):**  there's still some of the old timers that you're just trying to keep up with.  We've got a couple of those too.  You kind of stick around for the brief and kind of listen where he wants you to go light  
**[0:37:14-0:37:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:37:14):**  fire, then he'll just go take his torch and do it and you better keep up.  Yeah, we've met.  We know that guy.  
**[0:37:22-0:37:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:37:22):**  I told somebody else, I said, I used to think I get all of a sudden when I started kind  of having a little more of like a managerial role in burning, it went from being one of  my favorite times of the year to absolutely one of my least favorite things to do.  
**[0:37:38-0:37:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:37:38):**  I've kind of gone the other way.  I really enjoy the planning.  I enjoy sitting down here staring at Google Earth for two or three nights in a row looking  
**[0:37:52-0:38:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:37:52):**  at wind maps and looking at the map of what we're going to burn and figuring out how to  do it safely and contingency plans if it gets away.  Write up a big briefing document, have a safety brief that morning.  
**[0:38:05-0:38:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:38:05):**  If I've done my job for the two days beforehand, I brief my crew and I just go sit on a hill  and listen to the radio and watch everybody do what they're supposed to do and just watch  this beautiful fire come together.  
**[0:38:17-0:38:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:38:17):**  It works like that about 15% of the time but it's pretty cool what it does.  I enjoy the management and planning aspects of doing prescribed fire in a complex environment.  I also still love getting on, you know, grabbing that drip torch and walking a canyon and making  
**[0:38:39-0:38:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:38:39):**  a whole bunch of cedars get really, really warm.  That's the ones I like too.  I would say maybe we, it's not that, I mean, there's a lot of really capable people in  
**[0:38:57-0:39:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:38:57):**  this part of the world that know how to deal with the fires and know how to put them out,  know how to, where to pinch them in and do those things.  That might be to our detriment at times that, you know, because you kind of get to where  
**[0:39:10-0:39:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:39:10):**  you know you're wanting to be and you're like, you know what would really help carry that  fire?  A 20 mile an hour wind.  
**[0:39:17-0:39:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:39:17):**  And so, you know, you start kind of pushing it, you know, yeah, this would burn at that  humidity but, you know, it would really make that thing crackle and sizzle if it was really  low, you know.  
**[0:39:27-0:39:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:39:27):**  Made it till it was like 4% humidity at 95 degrees with a 14.5 mile an hour wind right  on the hairy edge.  That's right, that's right.  
**[0:39:39-0:39:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:39:39):**  Yeah.  And those are days that get interesting and have a tendency to get long.  Yeah, yeah, those are the, and we still, and I would argue this is the right thing and  
**[0:39:49-0:39:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:39:49):**  we're blessed to have the opportunity to meet a safe fire is a big fire.  You know, the longer you string the lines, the fewer interactions you need to have with  it.  
**[0:39:59-0:40:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:39:59):**  You keep the people out of it just, and it gets it over with.  And so, you know, we're still, you know, I mean, there's several that we're doing that  are, you know, 10 to 15 mile long lights.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:40:14):**  And those are, those get it over with, I guess, but they can, it just, they make for tense  moments.  That kind of thing, we tend to do things differently here.  
**[0:40:27-0:40:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:40:27):**  We'll go out and prep it, mow a fire, sometimes, you know, make a bare dirt strip, blade, whatever  we need to do around just the area we want to burn.  And that's all we put fire on.  
**[0:40:37-0:40:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:40:37):**  When you do that, you start, you know, in the downwind corner on a downwind side and  do a ring fire, light your backfire, then come up the flanks and do the head.  And it's always my goal, no matter how many miles of fire line we have to do, it is always  
**[0:40:50-0:40:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:40:50):**  my goal.  I want to have the thing circled in by about two o'clock because at two o'clock, you still  have fairly good weather.  
**[0:40:58-0:41:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:40:58):**  Your weather, like your fire weather tradition on a typical burn day from two to four or  five o'clock, that's your high danger.  So if you get your circle closed up at two, you know, if that's your goal to get it closed  
**[0:41:13-0:41:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:41:13):**  up as soon as possible, that lets you knock units off the line to go start doing your  patrols, your downwind and your flank patrols before your peak danger hour when you have  the lowest humidity of the day and the highest temperature of the day, which is going to  
**[0:41:27-0:41:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:41:27):**  occur sometime between four and six, depending on what time of year.  And usually you make it to that point where you feel the warmth just knock out of the  day.  
**[0:41:40-0:41:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:41:40):**  Yup.  And the wind turned cool.  As soon as you feel that on a fire line, I'll make one more lap and if it hasn't escaped,  
**[0:41:47-0:41:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:41:47):**  I'll send everybody home.  Yeah.  Because at that point you're done because the humidity is coming up, temperature is  
**[0:41:52-0:42:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:41:52):**  going down, your fire danger is dropping rapidly.  What's the typical size of a fire out there?  Oh gosh, I mean, you're saying like 15-20,000 acres and I would very, very rarely will we  
**[0:42:04-0:42:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:42:04):**  do something that big.  That's a once every three or four years.  We'll do a lot of them.  
**[0:42:10-0:42:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:42:10):**  We'll do several in the 5,000 range.  A lot of them are more in the two-three thousand range just because it's...  But they're good manageable ones.  
**[0:42:17-0:42:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:42:17):**  That's what a lot of people, we've talked to like EPA or KDHE types and KDHE gets it  pretty good.  And EPA will if you talk to them, but you know, like 80 acres and they want you to burn  
**[0:42:31-0:42:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:42:31):**  an 80 and then like a 160 and like those are awful.  Yeah, they want you to do like, well, you can't burn whole thing.  You got to do this 80, this 80, this 80, this 80.  
**[0:42:39-0:42:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:42:39):**  Right.  I understand.  That doesn't...  
**[0:42:42-0:42:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:42:42):**  And that's why I say a safe fire is a big fire.  And you get into those, you know, that extra zero putting them into the thousands.  Those really are a safer fire than burning that 80 and then go burn in that quarter and  
**[0:42:53-0:43:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:42:53):**  then burn in that quarter and then burn in that 80.  Those are just, you got people in the fire all the time and you just can't get out of  the way and let that thing go.  
**[0:43:02-0:43:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:43:02):**  I'm thinking of one we did, oh, I think it was three or four years ago over on the Nichols  Ranch Southeast of me.  It was 5,300 acres.  
**[0:43:14-0:43:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:43:14):**  It was so big from one side to the other, our radios wouldn't reach.  So we did have, we kind of had to put somebody in the middle.  So one line boss could talk to the other line boss and we can make sure we're coordinating.  
**[0:43:25-0:43:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:43:25):**  So I got put in charge of one side.  The other guy was in charge of the other side.  And I'd measured the fire line the night before.  
**[0:43:34-0:43:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:43:34):**  It was like 20 miles, I think to get her like 20 some miles to get around this thing.  And we didn't get started until 1030.  And the last words of the briefing, right before we lit the torches, I said, speed is  
**[0:43:49-0:43:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:43:49):**  life.  Let's get this done.  Keep moving.  
**[0:43:53-0:43:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:43:53):**  And we got around it.  We had the circle closed up in under three hours.  Maybe it was right at three hours.  
**[0:43:59-0:44:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:43:59):**  Yeah.  It's just hang the drip torch out the window, the side by side, turn both valves on all  the way and just 10 miles an hour down the fire line until it ran out and stop and refill.  
**[0:44:10-0:44:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:44:10):**  That's the way to do it.  That's the way to do it.  It was pretty intense.  
**[0:44:14-0:44:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:44:14):**  And that one stayed 100% inside.  Well, no, it didn't stay inside the fire lines.  That one got out.  
**[0:44:20-0:44:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:44:20):**  But that wasn't my fault.  It got out.  Never is.  
**[0:44:28-0:44:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:44:28):**  I've taken the blame for a couple like, there's two of them that I'll own that was just a  failure of planning on my part or failure of vision or failure of preparation.  There's a couple you got to own.  
**[0:44:42-0:44:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:44:42):**  There's some that really nobody could have seen happening.  And sometimes you'll have one get away from it when you got all the units there and everything's  going right.  
**[0:44:53-0:45:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:44:53):**  And a rabbit runs.  We had a dirt devil fly through one or a windstorm deal, fire devil, I guess at that point.  My brother was on the front and I was driving, I don't know, second or third truck.  
**[0:45:09-0:45:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:45:09):**  And we were getting it beat down pretty good.  And that thing blew through there.  And my brother looked back at it and goes, neat.  
**[0:45:15-0:45:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:45:15):**  But his word, and you see that big old flame, a big old tower of fire blow through that  deal.  And then it went into the grass and it kept going like, oh.  
**[0:45:26-0:45:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:45:26):**  I had one of those happen on me a couple of years ago.  We were up by my buddy's resort lake that he owns.  There's a bunch of houses, there's like 60 houses around this resort lake.  
**[0:45:37-0:45:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:45:37):**  And we're burning the part of the property that was just right west of it.  Of course, we're doing it with a west wind because there wasn't any we could really do  it with.  
**[0:45:46-0:45:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:45:46):**  And we were just lighting up the last, I think 400 acre unit that was all kind of connected.  And the wind switched a little bit and we had one of those fire and smoke tornadoes  come up.  
**[0:45:59-0:46:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:45:59):**  And it passed right to the north of where we're all sitting there eating pizza and was  headed right for the resort lake with 60 houses and all this tall grass around it.  Oh no, but it dropped the fire by the time it got over there.  
**[0:46:14-0:46:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:46:14):**  It was just smoke and ash and went whipping right across.  But yeah, I've seen those.  And it's kind of strange because you see them fairly often.  
**[0:46:24-0:46:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:46:24):**  Like I'll see a couple of years.  I mean, not every time you go on a burn, but I mean, it's fairly often.  But getting that on camera, getting a picture of video that is just almost impossible.  
**[0:46:37-0:46:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:46:37):**  I think is when you see them, you just stare like that.  My brother just, he knew it wasn't a good thing, but just stared at it because it's  just so crazy and loud and bizarre and big old funnel full of fire moving that fast.  
**[0:46:53-0:47:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:46:53):**  Funnel cloud full of fire cruising past.  Yeah, and you just kind of look at it and go, wow, look at that.  Glad that's not heading my way.  
**[0:47:00-0:47:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:47:00):**  Yeah, and then it can lay waste to a lot of work you just got done doing in a hurry.  So while we're talking about burning, now, this isn't my viewpoint.  Because like I said, I'm not there.  
**[0:47:19-0:47:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:47:19):**  This is just what I've heard is that the burning program you guys have had in the Flint Hills,  and I say you guys not a personal attack at all, for so many years of burning kind of  in that same basic timeframe at kind of the middle of April, turning out double stock  
**[0:47:37-0:47:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:47:37):**  and yearlings, is that shifting away from the native forage to a different forage composition?  Or is that allowing some invasive species to express themselves that aren't vulnerable  to fire at that time?  
**[0:47:51-0:48:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:47:51):**  I think the answer is yes.  And here's where this thing gets a little hard.  Why are they burning in April?  
**[0:48:04-0:48:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:48:04):**  Well, it's because of what we talked about everybody's stalkers.  That's what you do in the Flint Hills.  And that's what you do.  
**[0:48:11-0:48:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:48:11):**  So it wasn't a problem.  And I don't know in terms of a native base, I don't think it really got into like the  four main grasses, for example, I don't think it really hurt them much.  
**[0:48:23-0:48:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:48:23):**  I think they're all fine.  Obviously, the big worries in the room are sericea lespedeza, which we can't kill a fire  and that freaks out anybody in the Flint Hills.  
**[0:48:36-0:48:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:48:36):**  Though the one that's going to be bigger than that, it's all of a sudden starting to show  up as old world bluestem.  And old world bluestems are a mess, a mess mess to have here in the Flint Hills.  
**[0:48:47-0:48:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:48:47):**  What are you talking about?  That's my favorite grass.  Yeah.  
**[0:48:50-0:49:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:48:50):**  Well, in sericea lespedeza is the favorite legume in a lot of places in Missouri too.  One man's trash is another man's treasure, right?  I was kidding about old world bluestem.  
**[0:49:01-0:49:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:49:01):**  I know.  But you know, there's still places that you can buy the seed at the hardware store and  go put it in.  
**[0:49:06-0:49:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:49:06):**  I mean, it's still a, but it's a...  I wish the state technical committee would just ban it.  I do too.  
**[0:49:14-0:49:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:49:14):**  Yeah, I do too.  There's a lot of things I wish we could do there.  So it is a problem.  
**[0:49:24-0:49:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:49:24):**  What I worry about is if we start moving the different times on burns, will we have as  many acres burned?  Because if you look at it, we're still in a deficit, even as much acres as we burn in  
**[0:49:36-0:49:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:49:36):**  the Flint Hills.  If you look at it in actual terms of like brush woody encroachment, we're still losing  the battle and there's still enough acres that aren't getting burnt enough.  
**[0:49:46-0:49:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:49:46):**  If we intentionally start chopping it up, would that be negative?  Isn't that crazy that you guys burn almost 2 million acres a year in the Flint Hills  and you're still...  
**[0:49:59-0:50:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:49:59):**  We're still not doing it enough.  Yeah.  We're still losing that encroachment fight.  
**[0:50:06-0:50:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:50:06):**  We're just hanging on tooth and nail to maintain a core here in the red Hills.  And it's...  Yeah.  
**[0:50:12-0:50:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:50:12):**  Well, I think what we look at is when you actually look at those data points, we look  good.  But if you look at it like on a...  
**[0:50:19-0:50:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:50:19):**  If you just take a snapshot of it, you look, oh, the Flint Hills are pretty good.  But if you look at it marginally where we're at, we're just 30 years behind Manhattan or  any other place.  
**[0:50:31-0:50:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:50:31):**  We're losing it the same.  We're just on a different point of that curve and we're waiting to explode.  But we're still...  
**[0:50:37-0:50:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:50:37):**  The path is pretty well defined where we're at now if nothing changes.  And that's a scary...  That's not good.  
**[0:50:46-0:51:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:50:46):**  But to go to your point, I'm actually going to try some summer burns this year.  I think there are some things they can do for some woody types.  My worry, and I don't know how to make this all work together, is what we had talked about  
**[0:51:00-0:51:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:51:00):**  earlier.  What's my favorite fall feed?  Rank grass and bayourette mineral.  
**[0:51:05-0:51:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:51:05):**  That is the absolute cheapest thing I can do for a cow.  If I summer burn, I remove all my rank grass.  And if you've got moisture, you'll have a good flush.  
**[0:51:20-0:51:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:51:20):**  You will, but you're supposed to be pretty easy.  You're supposed to be pretty light on that grass too, aren't you?  You've got to be really light on that late summer flush after burning.  
**[0:51:31-0:51:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:51:31):**  Ask me how I know.  That's what I've heard.  And so that's my worry.  
**[0:51:39-0:51:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:51:39):**  There's a lot of stalker grass, I would argue, that it would not hurt at all even to ship  those cattle off and then burn that pasture.  Or let it regrow burn.  
**[0:51:48-0:52:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:51:48):**  I think you're going to give up a little gain on a certain pasture year to year, but I think  you can move it around.  I've gotten so dependent on scavenging that rank grass in my operation, it's going to  
**[0:52:02-0:52:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:52:02):**  cost me a lot of money to summer burn.  Now it might be worth it because in terms of saving pasture itself or saving chemical  or whatever it's going to be in terms of trying to get brush, I might not have a choice.  
**[0:52:15-0:52:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:52:15):**  But I can't present off-season burns as a money saver in my operation.  And that's the-  I would agree with that from what I know of ranching economics in the Flint Hills.  
**[0:52:26-0:52:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:52:26):**  And that's unfortunate, but we've been able to, to this point, nobody believed me.  And I think it's because we had kind of a closed herd, didn't bring cattle in.  We didn't have sericea on our ranch and then all of a sudden last year, it was like, son  
**[0:52:41-0:52:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:52:41):**  of a gun, where did this come from?  And it was everywhere.  And so, not everywhere, I mean isolated, but it was on two different sides of the river.  
**[0:52:49-0:52:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:52:49):**  I get showed up in multiple locations at once.  And so now we got it.  And same thing, I have like a little patch of like a 15 foot by 15 foot of old world  
**[0:52:59-0:53:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:52:59):**  bluestem that I'm working on on a place that has- don't know how it got there.  And so I'm not too sure that- and that's where we'd be trying to do with like a summer burn  is trying to crunch on some old world bluestem pretty hard.  
**[0:53:16-0:53:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:53:16):**  Even though it's going to cost us money, I'm not too sure that the decision might be made  for us.  I'm not sure we have a choice.  
**[0:53:24-0:53:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:53:24):**  But yeah, there have been some that have burned like in November up here and I don't like  that.  I think that's too late.  
**[0:53:32-0:53:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:53:32):**  Too late.  There's no regrowth and then you just have- I don't like that.  Somewhere around that late July, early August, I think there's a window there on a wet year  
**[0:53:42-0:53:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:53:42):**  that it could work.  And I'd argue actually a lot of the April burns are too early.  I think if we did those more like last week of April, first week of May, we'd have better  
**[0:53:54-0:54:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:53:54):**  results than those anyway.  I've seen July 15th burns here in the Red Hills work great.  August 1st, August 15th and August 31st.  
**[0:54:08-0:54:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:54:08):**  Like we've covered that 45 day window here and I think that if we had moisture, there'd  be guys that would be willing to push, you know, push into August and maybe even a little  bit to September.  
**[0:54:21-0:54:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:54:21):**  I don't know what it's like there.  So here, if I've got good spring and winter moisture starting about the 21st of April,  I'll start to get cheat.  
**[0:54:33-0:54:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:54:33):**  Like I'll start to get some of my lower C3s coming up and that's a good high protein grass  or at least it is for me.  And about now, when the wheat starts to turn, all my cool season grass is shut off but I've  
**[0:54:47-0:55:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:54:47):**  had warm season grass for two weeks and another two weeks, it's really going to be kicking  ass especially if we get some more rain and I'll get almost all my grass production  before July 15th.  
**[0:55:00-0:55:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:55:00):**  Now, the question and then from like the end of July, then everything goes into phase three  and we're kind of coasting and we kind of fall into this nutritional pit where all my  warm season grasses are curing.  
**[0:55:16-0:55:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:55:16):**  I don't have any cool season because it's too hot.  There's no forbs because it's too hot but then we're waiting for that fall green up,  that fall flush of cool season grass.  
**[0:55:27-0:55:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:55:27):**  And I've seen years where we've had a warm and wet enough winter where I could carry  good cool season grass all year, all the way through the winter.  That's maybe like one out of seven.  
**[0:55:37-0:55:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:55:37):**  So I'm not ever going to bank on that happening again.  And kind of like we talked about earlier, grazing management.  A big part to grazing management is not just figuring out how you're going to graze this  
**[0:55:51-0:56:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:55:51):**  year.  It's how do I get back to here with this number of livestock?  How do I manage my forage budget successfully through the year?  
**[0:56:00-0:56:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:56:00):**  You can't plan your winter grazing now.  I start planning my winter grazing now.  I just have a gross idea how much forage I'm going to take out during the summer so I know  
**[0:56:12-0:56:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:56:12):**  how much I'm going to leave for pasture stockpile this winter.  Is your cool season, is it like a native cool season?  Is it in your prairie?  
**[0:56:27-0:56:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:56:27):**  Have you been able to get some of that coming up?  Is it more like our deal?  Do you have improved pastures that you're really cranking down and managing hard like  
**[0:56:37-0:56:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:56:37):**  we're doing?  So an improved pasture would be something that was farmed that was planted back to grass  that you can still plant some grasses in.  
**[0:56:46-0:56:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:56:46):**  I don't have any of that.  Dad took over the ranch back in the mid-80s.  He didn't want to farm and there wasn't farm machinery here and he didn't have the  
**[0:56:54-0:57:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:56:54):**  money to go buy it.  But there was about five or six hundred acres of farm ground.  He just went and got the no-till drill from the conservation district, or maybe not even  
**[0:57:03-0:57:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:57:03):**  no-till drill at the time, just got the grass drill and went and drilled in grass seed.  What he didn't do until about 12 or 15 years later was put forbs in with it.  And I think it was when he put the forbs in with it that things actually really started  
**[0:57:18-0:57:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:57:18):**  to turn around.  I remember all when I was a kid, I call one of the areas farm fields because it was old  farm fields and I called the other half of it north Indian and south Indian.  
**[0:57:32-0:57:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:57:32):**  There's some scattered around in other places, but between north and south Indian and the  farm fields, that's probably 75% of it.  I can remember for years, it was just short grass.  
**[0:57:45-0:58:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:57:45):**  It was just buffalo grass.  It was just real short sod, not a whole lot coming up down there.  After I came back from the Navy in 2006, about 10 years after he'd planted the forbs down  
**[0:58:01-0:58:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:58:01):**  there, we started changing up grazing pressure a little bit.  All of a sudden, we started getting good grass down there.  I think forbs are key, but I guess to go back and answer your question, no, I don't have  
**[0:58:12-0:58:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:58:12):**  any improved grass.  Everything I have is native.  Something I've said several times is, yeah, there's native range and there's a lot of it  
**[0:58:22-0:58:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:58:22):**  in the world.  We talked about how little of it there is.  Let's tweak that terminology a little bit.  
**[0:58:31-0:58:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:58:31):**  We can take a field, a piece of ground, and we can plant it back to the natives.  Native grass is native forbs.  We can call that native range.  
**[0:58:43-0:58:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:58:43):**  We can all agree on that.  But I started using another term, old-growth grassland.  The old-growth grassland is the stuff that's never been plowed.  
**[0:58:54-0:59:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:58:54):**  I know you've got a bunch of it because you can't plow something that's 85% rocks.  I've got a bunch of it because you can't plow something that's on a 30-degree slope.  The old-growth grasslands, I'm sure there are some species in there that weren't here.  
**[0:59:15-0:59:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:59:15):**  Some of the bromes are fine.  They're not taking over the world.  They're not taking over the world and they're just a nice bump for cool season protein.  
**[0:59:24-0:59:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:59:24):**  Old-world bluestem, I agree, is a bad problem.  I've got a little bit more than a 12 by 12 patch.  I'm thinking a lot of people are about to.  
**[0:59:35-0:59:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:59:35):**  I think it's more pervasive.  I think as soon as people learn how to ID it, they're going to find out they all have  a bigger problem than what they thought.  
**[0:59:42-0:59:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:59:42):**  Yeah, it's kind of like Cerise.  Once you see it, you see it and you see it everywhere.  It's like you freak out.  
**[0:59:48-1:00:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=0:59:48):**  Old-world, man, that's a tough one to crack.  I've been down the chemical road with it.  I've tried Arsenal.  
**[1:00:00-1:00:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:00:00):**  I've tried Roundup.  Both of them work.  If you just want to nuke it, you kill it.  
**[1:00:07-1:00:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:00:07):**  You keep spraying it and you keep killing it and it'll be better.  You won't have old-world bluestem.  You stop spraying it and it'll come back.  
**[1:00:19-1:00:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:00:19):**  That's been my experience almost exclusively.  You could spray it, but it's just going to come back.  Grazed it hard.  
**[1:00:28-1:00:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:00:28):**  We grazed it 200,000 pounds stock density for one day.  Didn't hurt it.  We grazed it.  
**[1:00:36-1:00:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:00:36):**  I put cows on it at 100,000 pounds stock density on a day when we had two inches of rain.  It didn't hurt it.  Really?  
**[1:00:45-1:00:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:00:45):**  I'd have thought that might have got those crowns there high enough.  It breaks them up, but it doesn't kill it.  It just keeps spreading.  
**[1:00:52-1:01:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:00:52):**  Now the high with the rain also grew a lot of big bluestem in that area.  A lot of disturbance hadn't grown big bluestem, but two years later it's back to being choked  out by old-world.  
**[1:01:14-1:01:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:01:14):**  There's enough of it in the world that you'll never keep it off your ranch.  I'll never keep it off mine.  It's all up and down the road ditches because the county plants it.  
**[1:01:28-1:01:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:01:28):**  There's a lot of old-world bluestem hay that was transported around that put seed load  up and down the ditches.  It was a very popular thing to plant for erosion control in the 80s and 90s.  
**[1:01:38-1:01:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:01:38):**  A lot of guys planted it for erosion control in the 80s and 90s.  That's great.  It held those slopes and now it's going to hold down the rest of the pasture just as  
**[1:01:45-1:01:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:01:45):**  well.  I have a hard time thinking about trying to spray it to kill it, but I haven't found  anything else that's effective control.  
**[1:01:58-1:02:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:01:58):**  I think we can agree cattle really don't like to eat it.  When they do eat it, they don't really do very good on it.  On the other hand, maybe as it does become more of a component in the pasture, our cows  
**[1:02:14-1:02:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:02:14):**  will get more adapted to eat it and we'll learn how to eat it and use it.  That's my hope.  Anecdotally, my cows, I got about 30 from Josh and Gwen about a year and a half ago.  
**[1:02:33-1:02:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:02:33):**  A bunch of their red ones.  I bought a pile at a Woodward sale barn and I bought another pot load out of Lampasas,  Texas sale barn.  
**[1:02:42-1:02:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:02:42):**  I put together sale barn cows and some nice ones from Josh.  They don't know how to eat it.  They'd walk right by it.  
**[1:02:54-1:03:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:02:54):**  Okay, fine.  Not everybody likes pizza either.  I moved them last year.  
**[1:03:01-1:03:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:03:01):**  I moved them back across the road, put them in another part of the ranch and I brought  in some customer cattle down on that south end where I do have the old world bluestem  problem.  
**[1:03:12-1:03:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:03:12):**  The first customer's cows last summer, they just walked right by the old world.  They didn't look at it.  Okay, fine.  
**[1:03:18-1:03:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:03:18):**  Not everybody likes pizza.  Moved them out because they were a fall calving operation.  Took about three months off and I brought in another bunch of dry cows that started  
**[1:03:28-1:03:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:03:28):**  calving first in March.  They came off a ranch about an hour south of me down in Oklahoma.  He's got pastures that are literally 100% old world bluestem that these cows have been  
**[1:03:40-1:03:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:03:40):**  in and some of these cows he's had for four or five years.  Guess what they know how to eat?  They like pizza.  
**[1:03:48-1:03:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:03:48):**  They eat old world bluestem and they eat it down.  They eat it pretty hard.  I'm going to play with them a little bit this year.  
**[1:03:57-1:04:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:03:57):**  Might smash them into a spot without old world and see how they do with it because they're  eating it better than the last group of cows we tried it with.  Maybe we can get our cows trained to eat it.  
**[1:04:09-1:04:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:04:09):**  Maybe not.  That's the direction I'm going to go with old world.  I guess I'm still more scorched earth.  
**[1:04:17-1:04:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:04:17):**  I'm going to try to get.  I'm still going for complete eradication even if I know it isn't going to happen.  I feel like I have to because it's like you said our term is an old growth.  
**[1:04:31-1:04:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:04:31):**  I think it's what you called it.  But you know virgin we got the virgin prairie is what we call it here.  I guess I always look at it as I owe it to the prairie to at least try to keep some of  
**[1:04:41-1:04:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:04:41):**  these things beat back a little bit.  That's why we'd be looking at.  I was reading some work.  
**[1:04:47-1:05:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:04:47):**  I think maybe Casey Olson did a couple things like consecutive summer burns.  Like two or three consecutive fairly high intensity summer burns.  If you can get a high intensity summer burn but trying to damage those crowns that way.  
**[1:05:01-1:05:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:05:01):**  What's he calling a high intensity summer burn?  Well one that goes at a crawl not a slow crawl I think.  The higher intensity summer burn if you will.  
**[1:05:14-1:05:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:05:14):**  But something the crown and I'm getting out of my wheelhouse here.  So don't if somebody listens to this and corrects me that's fine.  I think the crowns are higher than native is what the deal is.  
**[1:05:28-1:05:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:05:28):**  And so I think it's higher off the ground.  Yeah higher up out of the ground.  I think that makes it more vulnerable to a summer burn than like a little blue stem or  
**[1:05:36-1:05:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:05:36):**  a big or a Indian or any of those.  And so I think it gets snapped back by that.  You won't kill it but you'll hurt it.  
**[1:05:45-1:05:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:05:45):**  And so the point is well you hurt it pretty bad.  Kind of come back the next year you hurt it a little more and then you just kind of hurt  it a little more and you just kind of try to beat it into submission that way.  
**[1:05:54-1:06:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:05:54):**  I think a guy could probably put some pain on it with like a July 15th August 1st burn  and then turn out on it three weeks later and just keep them on it and see what they  do.  
**[1:06:11-1:06:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:06:11):**  I wonder that might do something.  I mean you might at least keep it in phase two until it goes dormant and keep it from  going to seed.  
**[1:06:17-1:06:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:06:17):**  Keep it from seeding.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[1:06:20-1:06:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:06:20):**  Fair enough about old world blue stem.  I hate that.  There's a lot of people in fescue country right now going what?  
**[1:06:29-1:06:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:06:29):**  Something else I'm glad I don't have and if I infect fescue.  That's right.  I've told a lot of other people though after we planted this bottom to fescue and everybody's  
**[1:06:39-1:06:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:06:39):**  like what are you doing?  And I've thought you know the only people that don't love fescue are the people who  have only ranched with fescue and nothing else.  
**[1:06:49-1:07:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:06:49):**  You know they're like why would you ever do anything with fescue?  And it's like are you kidding me two acre stocking rate like graze it twice a year maybe  hay what I couldn't get ahead of like every time it rains three inches like I put the  
**[1:07:01-1:07:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:07:01):**  cattle out there because like it doesn't matter.  Yeah and if I do happen to kill it I just plant more.  It's not like this other stuff I have to treat with kid gloves.  
**[1:07:11-1:07:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:07:11):**  I mean I love fescue.  I love it.  Yeah and that's kind of that's something I was kind of wanting to say earlier when I  
**[1:07:18-1:07:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:07:18):**  talk about the farm ground what you used to have is just had this conversation the other  night like I might not mind having that now.  You know it might be really nice to have 600 acres of cool season covers that I know were  
**[1:07:33-1:07:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:07:33):**  in front of me that I know I can go down there and graze in the winter and have good for  my cows.  But you know getting from A to B if I would have been farming it this whole time I probably  
**[1:07:48-1:07:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:07:48):**  would have never got where I'm at.  That's right.  That's right.  
**[1:07:52-1:08:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:07:52):**  At least we're not farming.  Somebody listening to us in a tractor planting corn just turned it off.  Yeah I'm sure.  
**[1:08:02-1:08:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:08:02):**  I've got a lot of farmer friends I make fun of.  They sure think I'm insane.  They think I'm doing it wrong too.  
**[1:08:10-1:08:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:08:10):**  So with $9 corn or whatever I guess that the jury is out on the decision is still they  look to be winning it.  I don't know if they're winning or not.  
**[1:08:19-1:08:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:08:19):**  The inputs on that deal are horrible.  That's why I don't farm.  I don't understand the balance sheet of it.  
**[1:08:29-1:08:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:08:29):**  My education at K-State was actually not animal science but it was ag business actually and  for whatever reason I guess that made sense to me.  I can't do accounting for anything but I can balance sheets and cash flows and some of  
**[1:08:42-1:08:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:08:42):**  those make sense and the depreciation on steel is just an iron and tires and gas is just  too much.  I just can't do it.  
**[1:08:55-1:09:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:08:55):**  It really doesn't make sense with $5 diesel.  McCauley Kincaid says it best.  He says I cannot control what I make.  
**[1:09:06-1:09:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:09:06):**  I can't set my sales price.  I can only control what I spent.  He's right.  
**[1:09:13-1:09:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:09:13):**  That's a very limited lever that we have.  When you're locked into the green iron cure as my dad likes to call it for all the world's  problems or yellow iron cure if you're on the construction side, hey do you know what  
**[1:09:28-1:09:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:09:28):**  the difference is between a farmer and a construction worker?  Farmers don't pretend they're construction workers or equipment operators.  Farmers don't pretend they're equipment operators.  
**[1:09:48-1:09:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:09:48):**  If you're locked into that, you've got those equipment payments.  You've got that depreciation.  You've got that banker with a 5% note breathing down your neck and you've got to go get those  
**[1:09:58-1:10:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:09:58):**  crop insurance contracts so the banker can ensure that he's going to get his payment.  I heard it best.  A guy told me one time he said he'd buy another combine when he saw one lay down in the spring  
**[1:10:09-1:10:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:10:09):**  and have another.  You know what?  I like that one.  
**[1:10:16-1:10:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:10:16):**  I'm going to steal that.  It's pretty good.  Never seen a combine over having a baby swather in the field.  
**[1:10:31-1:10:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:10:31):**  It sounds like you manage quite a bit differently from most of your neighbors, which I'm assuming  are going to be typical Flint Hills operations.  What kind of differences are you seeing in the forage and in the soil from the difference  
**[1:10:47-1:11:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:10:47):**  in management?  I can't speak to their soils and some of those things because I don't measure theirs.  That's where it goes back to my worry about dogmas and stuff.  
**[1:11:04-1:11:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:11:04):**  Am I doing better than them?  I don't know.  I don't have proof of that.  
**[1:11:10-1:11:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:11:10):**  Am I improving my own system doing what I'm doing?  Yes, I am.  I've got the year on year soil samples, the forages that we're able to build.  
**[1:11:21-1:11:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:11:21):**  One thing I really lean into is technology on all these things.  Our ability to and data management.  I'm comfortable with data management, I think because of the cow side of things.  
**[1:11:34-1:11:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:11:34):**  When we're doing birth weight and weaning weight and yearling weight and ultrasound  and DNA and all these other observations on a cow.  It's pretty easy to make those leaps from the animal side and make those into the land  
**[1:11:50-1:12:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:11:50):**  side.  I think it usually goes slower than what people think and I think that's maybe oversold at  the cover crop seed sales level sometimes and some of the management.  
**[1:12:06-1:12:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:12:06):**  We've increased in the last 10 years.  I think we're up about 3% organic matter on some of those places we're really looking  at which is pretty good.  
**[1:12:17-1:12:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:12:17):**  I'd argue.  3% is an improvement.  I'm pretty happy with that.  
**[1:12:26-1:12:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:12:26):**  We actually just did our first Haney test.  It's kind of like a balance sheet I guess.  All I can say is on year one, we were better off than where I thought we would be but I  
**[1:12:39-1:12:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:12:39):**  can't give you any sort of tracks year over year because it's a snapshot in time.  But we had more going on in our soil than I thought we would.  In fact, I sent them on to Doug Spencer who works with NRCS if you know Doug and I said  
**[1:12:58-1:13:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:12:58):**  I don't want to be surprised but I think it's working.  It's actually looks like we're doing the right things.  We parlayed some of that.  
**[1:13:09-1:13:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:13:09):**  I don't know how much we want to talk to but I know you and I are doing some similar things  on some carbon storage and some of those.  One of the things that I think we have to do as we lean into technologies and do these  
**[1:13:23-1:13:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:13:23):**  is also get paid for it.  Ecosystem services and benefits.  Yeah.  
**[1:13:33-1:13:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:13:33):**  Increased revenue streams and like I said ultimately what's going to drive whether it's  carbon storage for better grazing or whether it's just name anything that you can talk  to on anybody about regenerative and it'll get the people who like to talk about ecology  
**[1:13:52-1:14:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:13:52):**  and only ecology especially NGOs and some of those makes them nervous but money is going  to make a lot of these things go.  You can do that either of one of two ways.  
**[1:14:05-1:14:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:14:05):**  You can go broke by not doing them and that's kind of that negative incentive or as I look  at different things that we do on our ranch and we can go into as many as we want but  I look for opportunities where it's a win-win for everybody.  
**[1:14:21-1:14:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:14:21):**  So whether that's me selling a semi-load of bread heifers or a bowl or a load of a certain  bowl to a semen project or whether it's working with virtual fence with our national preserve  neighbor or whether it's doing carbon storage it's what is the shortest distance that we  
**[1:14:40-1:14:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:14:40):**  can make it a win-win for everybody and the dirty truth is a lot of times the answer is  money.  When it's profitable for all parties that's what makes it go and also part of that is  
**[1:14:56-1:15:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:14:56):**  measuring these things I guess but that's where we're kind of where we see these things  going but yes we're getting better.  Yes we're tracking it.  
**[1:15:07-1:15:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:15:07):**  Yes we'll have a better idea in the future.  Yes it takes longer than I think maybe what it's sold to a lot of people.  I do wonder as I've been looking into some of these things I think I'm probably in a  
**[1:15:21-1:15:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:15:21):**  even moving three percent in 10 years so I've done some things that are probably considered  sacrilegious at times like this spring.  We had a rye cover crop and I had two decisions I could have plowed that into the ground and  
**[1:15:35-1:15:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:15:35):**  really had really good soil going into summer or I could have also silage cut it and put  it in a bag because I'm scared to death of where feed costs are going to be this fall  and I bagged it.  
**[1:15:46-1:16:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:15:46):**  I did.  I look at these things as this good soil is a bank and you put that money in you put those  reserves into that and every now and then you're going to have a time you got to make  
**[1:16:00-1:16:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:16:00):**  a withdrawal and that's this year on some of these feet prices we're making a withdrawal  on them.  Now granted we'll put manure back on and we'll try to remedy that as best as we can but will  
**[1:16:17-1:16:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:16:17):**  that hurt me a quarter of a point on organic matter maybe it will maybe it won't I don't  know and that's where I told you that maybe I'm not as pure into some of this thinking  of some people because I still kind of think about it as a business first and then the  
**[1:16:32-1:16:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:16:32):**  regenerative stuff is the best way we run the business not the other way around and  ultimately why is that was because we still have loans we were still a fairly young business  and we still I still do have to answer to those bankers at the end of the day and so  
**[1:16:46-1:17:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:16:46):**  I can't just I can't just not for a year you know take a year off because it doesn't work  that way.  I can't take a year off either I wish I could yeah it'd be nice being so dry just be like  
**[1:17:01-1:17:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:17:01):**  you know what screw it it's dry I don't want to do this this year I'm going to Florida  that wouldn't it be great yeah or we should have all just sold out in 2014 and if I had  a crystal ball what I shouldn't have done is doubled up like the the winner of 2019  
**[1:17:15-1:17:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:17:15):**  I thought it was going to be my year I mean we loaded up we had the right feed and we  had a lot of cattle and then then COVID happened and that didn't that didn't work out so well  going going for the bunch of cattle there but 2020 wasn't a bad year to raise cows was  
**[1:17:31-1:17:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:17:31):**  it was good rainy year yeah well it was wasn't a good year to have a whole bunch of them  on feed because we had a bunch we had a bunch of cattle on we had a bunch of stalkers on  and then that was when the plant fire happened yeah and I'm also pretty slow to learn and  
**[1:17:45-1:18:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:17:45):**  so when the plant fire happened and it bottomed it out we put them all on feed I thought you  know what you crooks we're not going to take that watch me win and so we had a bunch of  cattle that were supposed to come out like April 15th and yeah it yeah we probably should  
**[1:18:01-1:18:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:18:01):**  just sold them after the fire and found a place to hide but we didn't do that but but  yeah some learned I think that well learn lesson is a story now yeah you can't beat  the Packers no no that's you can't and that's and that's part of you know some years we  
**[1:18:23-1:18:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:18:23):**  feed some years we don't and that I think that goes one of the lessons I learned when  I was a commodity broker is one of the one of the things I still kind of think about  a lot is we had a saying that the market will remain irrational longer than you can remain  
**[1:18:36-1:18:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:18:36):**  solvent and so as individual players in this market it really doesn't matter what you or  I think at the end of the day the markets kind of going to do what it's going to do  and I mean we can all try to like help it one way or the other but at some point we  
**[1:18:53-1:19:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:18:53):**  you know essentially we take what's given to us or you know it's going to be what it  is and you can kind of you can kind of you make it work I guess yeah yeah you know talking  about markets and in market power been on my mind a lot of course you know the last  
**[1:19:13-1:19:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:19:13):**  couple episodes with Mike Calicrate Brett Kinsey Don Shufflebean we've been talking  about you know access to markets and and market power but where do you draw the line and who  enforces that yes if you give that weapon to government there's a here's a tent I don't  
**[1:19:32-1:19:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:19:32):**  know I and by the way I like to shuffle by an interview so this is I guess as a I am  a fan boy and now on the show itself so that's kind of weird but I am a listener of ranching  but I like I I like I don't like having everybody sound the same I I like the idea of getting  
**[1:19:55-1:20:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:19:55):**  some I think you need to get a packer on here honestly okay I I would I throw down most  of my news as a as a like too old to claim to be a millennial but not exactly a like  a gen x I'm kind of stuck in the middle like I'm kind of I lean your way 36 to 44 yeah  
**[1:20:17-1:20:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:20:17):**  yeah I'm there too it's like weird lost half generation in there that I'm kind of like  I don't know what TikTok is but I don't really care for being spoon-fed cable news and so  like I'm a podcast guy so I get all my information from podcasts so this is this is kind of nice  
**[1:20:35-1:20:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:20:35):**  but so what what kind of meat pack like a plant manager or somebody from no I think  you need to get a big three on here no I think you need to get a JBS guy on here I'd really  I would really I that's what I want okay well let's let's let's do that let's throw it up  
**[1:20:54-1:21:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:20:54):**  all all for I don't know I don't know who to tell you to get but that but I I don't  I don't think you know I don't ever get on a podcast to be comfortable in terms of as  a listener you know I I want to I want to learn and I don't mind you know listening  
**[1:21:10-1:21:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:21:10):**  to to one you know somebody that's way on one side of an argument and somebody way on  the other side but um but no I I I think you need to really go deep on that and I don't  like I said they they don't know me they they're not gonna I've got a form letter I've got  
**[1:21:31-1:21:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:21:31):**  a form letter I'll send out let let's see if any of the 14 people that actually listen  to the podcast besides you have a suggestion or have a contact maybe at Cargill, JBS, Marfrig  or Tyson I wouldn't yeah let's do it that'd be that'd be interesting I have no idea what  
**[1:21:48-1:22:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:21:48):**  kind of questions I'm asked but I usually don't have any idea what kind of questions  to ask anyway. There my my worry about the whole marketing thing and and this goes back  to it's kind of what I meant there you know with the with my comment about the market  
**[1:22:05-1:22:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:22:05):**  can do irrational things is at the end of the day I don't think the market cares what  I think but what I 100% what I do want as a seed stock provider is what you know and  that like I'll tell you like I do stock grower council on KLA why do I do that I want to  
**[1:22:24-1:22:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:22:24):**  be involved because I want to make sure that my customers are successful because I can't  be in business selling bulls unless the guys who buy my bulls are successful and so a lot  of those cattle go into those traditional marketing avenues you know there's there's  
**[1:22:43-1:23:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:22:43):**  not there's a lot of guys that do it you know they're doing what you're doing but they're  not all and so you know they're going to Cargill they're going to Tyson they're going to those  places and so they can't just go away I don't think they can just go away.  
**[1:23:00-1:23:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:23:00):**  I think they the term that would be used in Congress is too big to fail.  Which I think is I have a I have a libertarian leaning like you I know from listening to  the show that's problematic in whatever business that we're talking about I don't like too  
**[1:23:19-1:23:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:23:19):**  big to fail whether it's a bank or a packer or car builder or anybody but I'm not too  sure and this is where I'll probably get in trouble do we have a packer problem or do  we have a feed yard problem and when I say that is the packers only one half of that  
**[1:23:40-1:23:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:23:40):**  deal they're taking the deal that is given to them and when we get a lot of these corporate  feeders that are that are making these deals that are you know kind of off there's the  transparency deal I think is it should be fairly low hanging fruit.  
**[1:23:59-1:24:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:23:59):**  You'd think.  And that's my worry about it is I the way I look at it is you know it's a free market  you're allowed to take you know do what you want with your money I get that argument but  
**[1:24:09-1:24:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:24:09):**  on the same side of that you're not allowed to be a market externality either and I think  we're getting to the market sizes on some of these things that you know once you're  an actual externality on the market that's where regulation has its place where you can't  
**[1:24:27-1:24:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:24:27):**  you can't just kind of grenade somebody else not because of a you know it's above and beyond  and it's going to be you know where the debates are is not you know what is a fair market  what's a free market and what's an externality I think is there'll be all sorts of fights  
**[1:24:43-1:25:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:24:43):**  about this but you you can't just throw your weight around to that extent that you can  just crowd it out.  Well evidently you can and that's the problem but I you know I'll put it this way if I would  
**[1:25:02-1:25:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:25:02):**  have if I had a self-inflicted wound after self-inflicted wound as mush rush ranches  and there are so few red angus bulls for sale or bulls in general for sale that every time  I had a bad management decision and I killed 20 cows and so I had five less bulls for sale  
**[1:25:20-1:25:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:25:20):**  and then I did something else and I killed more bulls and every time I did that the price  of bulls just went up and up and up it wouldn't really it wouldn't really send me the market  signal that I should be a better cattle manager right and I think that's where the packers  
**[1:25:36-1:25:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:25:36):**  are at is every time they burn something down they're rewarded for it and so why do better  and I know you know they'll say market share and all this and they and they really do I  mean for my brief one year working there I mean I don't doubt that they work together  
**[1:25:56-1:26:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:25:56):**  when they you know that's a little strong phrase they they would prefer to steal market  share from each other I guess I'll put it that way and I don't think there's any sort  of you know JBS says I'm gonna run it down this week and then you do it next week and  
**[1:26:09-1:26:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:26:09):**  we're all fine I I think they'd just be fine if they all ran each you know all the ones  broke and then they were just a sole monopoly but I something still in the market mechanism  is obviously broke and and that's my worry is like I said is we got to get we got to  
**[1:26:29-1:26:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:26:29):**  get the right type of cattle rewarded I don't and I kind of I think it's maybe a straw man  argument that I hear a lot of times that you know well if we go back to to you know sort  of a cash market well all the cattle will be the price the same that's not true at the  
**[1:26:46-1:27:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:26:46):**  sale barn level or you know if you get on a video sale seven weights still have a huge  you know twenty thirty dollars a hundred in price and we have technology tools here and  I think through technology is where we'll get is where these cattle will be priced better  
**[1:27:08-1:27:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:27:08):**  but I'm on this issue I'm tightly held conviction but how's the saying go strong convictions  loosely held all I know now is I don't like where we're at now and I think is it puts  my customers at a at a at a disadvantage to sell their calf crops you know my my five  
**[1:27:29-1:27:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:27:29):**  hundred head I feed out a year I'll be honest I just might quit and and it's to the point  that I don't need to do that for pride and I'll just quit and that's I think what they  want anyway and that's fine and dandy but I still have to have a good market for my  
**[1:27:45-1:28:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:27:45):**  customers to sell their calves and I don't know if that's where we're at now and unfortunately  yeah we're probably going to be there in a couple years because so many cows have been  slaughtered because of drought and low margins and everything else and is that really where  
**[1:28:01-1:28:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:28:01):**  we're at as an industry is we just wait for a really bad continental drought to come by  once a decade and take out so much production that we have a couple good years and it you  know it feels cheap that doesn't feel like a very sustainable business plan to me and  
**[1:28:17-1:28:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:28:17):**  there has to be a better way and it seems like where we're at with the drought and cattle  cycle that it should just go up for the next 18 to 24 months yeah like up up up like we  might see another 2014 style peak as long as as long as the geopolitical stuff stays  
**[1:28:39-1:28:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:28:39):**  in balance well yeah but you know and but that brings up another point you know like  these these geopolitical risks and covid kind of showed this the food shortage you know  you're a navy guy and and the examples I've used is actually kind of navy related that  
**[1:28:58-1:29:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:28:58):**  efficiency sometimes maybe isn't the best answer that we need when food security is  involved and you know the it's the cheapest way for the navy to run the carrier groups  would be to lash them side by side you know you just dock two aircraft carriers together  
**[1:29:15-1:29:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:29:15):**  that saved the taxpayer billions of dollars a year that'd be a cheap way to run aircraft  carriers but we spread them all over why because there's some redundancies you don't want them  all in one place because bad things can happen you know it's incredibly efficient to have  
**[1:29:33-1:29:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:29:33):**  you know the southwest kansas corridor and shoot you could almost throw a rock and dodge  city and throw from one six thousand head a day to another six thousand head a day yep  and there's there's efficiencies there and and if you've ever been in one of those plants  
**[1:29:45-1:30:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:29:45):**  it's it's unbelievable and fairly important that we have that but where who who pays for  the lack of redundancy when the wheels come off and that's the worry is it's not the industry  itself they're able to us and the consumers yeah and and ultimately the taxpayers are  
**[1:30:09-1:30:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:30:09):**  probably going to get handed a big bill which again disproportionately kind of lands on  livestock producers and landowners yeah and so it's a it's a it's a uh we're gonna pay  to we're gonna pay taxes for the next 20 years to bail ourselves out this year that's how  
**[1:30:26-1:30:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:30:26):**  it works and so you know i i don't know i i uh i've i've listened to all of them and  i know you have a couple podcasts you haven't published yet that probably have some guys  talking solely about cattle marketing and i guess i'll put it this way i'm well last  
**[1:30:43-1:31:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:30:43):**  week was corbett wall but you haven't heard that yet no that's i knew you had him you  told me that and then when we moved ours so i i don't i'm sure corbett wall has an opinion  yeah on on uh what needs to be done here but uh i don't uh you know i i've uh i've ruffled  
**[1:31:04-1:31:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:31:04):**  from i've ruffled feathers at kla i think i i think we can say that i know i did um  and that's fine um you know that's kind of going back to the shuffle buying podcast i  mean people you gotta go gotta show up gotta get involved i i still do i still do prescribe  
**[1:31:23-1:31:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:31:23):**  to that line of thinking pretty hard um yeah when you said you you worked with kla i like  i tried to suppress an inward groan and then i thought about that shufflebean line like  you should we gotta work with people you gotta show up everybody should and you know i'll  
**[1:31:39-1:31:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:31:39):**  tell you this um there's some there's some times that that things will go on there that'll  frustrate me but there's also some really good things that they do um and even if you  don't agree with them on say cattle marketing um you know property taxes in the state of  
**[1:31:58-1:32:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:31:58):**  kansas you look around and you got a pretty good deal and if you don't think you got a  pretty good deal go ask somebody at ranches in nebraska what their property taxes are  yeah and and you know i mean there's some you know that doesn't all just happen by accident  
**[1:32:14-1:32:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:32:14):**  like that's not because that was you know that wasn't thought of by the kansas city  legislatures and so you know so there's some i don't i'd tell anybody to get involved i  really would um now don't think you're gonna walk in and win everything because that's  
**[1:32:28-1:32:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:32:28):**  just not how life works when you're an adult in fact i'd argue if you're a self-employed  adult in the livestock industry it's gonna be like normal like you're probably gonna  lose 25 now you win 25 of the time 20 of the time and you'll probably spin your bearings  
**[1:32:44-1:33:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:32:44):**  80 but it's sounds about right but it's you know you've got to be involved i think um  but as far as the cattle marketing i i the transparency deal seems like an easy win to  me i i don't especially some sort of an anonymous contract library it seems i i don't know i  
**[1:33:05-1:33:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:33:05):**  don't know what that would hurt um you know and like the ideas that get into your you  know and everybody knows i sell red angus bulls for maybe i'm i'm i'm used to it here  i'm already conditioned to it you know mushrush red angus has a bull sale in march and with  
**[1:33:21-1:33:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:33:21):**  facebook anymore before i even know what the average is stock exchange and somebody else  dv auction will put the averages on facebook and everybody knows what i sold bulls for  before i even know what they sold for and so i'm kind of used to having my underwear  
**[1:33:37-1:33:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:33:37):**  out in public i guess you know kind of everybody everybody kind of knows and like a contract  library wouldn't even be that pervasive it'd be anonymous yet so you just see what red  angus bulls in the state of kansas brought well but one argument i've heard against that  
**[1:33:55-1:34:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:33:55):**  is they said well they'll be able to go through that anonymous contract library with all the  numbers and figure out what's going where and who's buying what like who like who's  gonna have are you gonna have the time to sit down and do that am i am i gonna care  
**[1:34:15-1:34:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:34:15):**  no what's that i guess that's my yeah who who cares i you know they're the only ones  that care to keep them in the dark the rest of us want them out in the open well and from  from my days of doing that in the contract the stock everybody kind of knows that stuff  
**[1:34:34-1:34:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:34:34):**  anyway i'll be honest with you like it's you don't have it you don't have it really you  know contract for contract but you know who's in a buying position and who's in a short  position and and you know you know what even well with with electronic trades it gets a  
**[1:34:52-1:35:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:34:52):**  little harder now but i mean even in the pit days you know who's doing give up business  trying to get stuff i mean the industry kind of knows where these things are anyway even  if they're not published so i don't i don't know i don't know what that would hurt um  
**[1:35:08-1:35:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:35:08):**  i do like the mandated cash trades i do see the argument that it could hurt somebody like  me who is one selling red-headed cattle and selling a couple of them a year i mean i could  see me being forced to take the back the back seat on some different things and and that's  
**[1:35:26-1:35:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:35:26):**  a whole other can of worms we could go down but um yeah and back to that mandated trade  okay it sounds like a great concept but in whose hands are you going to place that weapon  yeah are you going to give that weapon to government are you going to trust that they're  
**[1:35:46-1:36:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:35:46):**  going to wield that weapon responsibly for that's until the end of time and the people  who are really on board with that and there was a brief period of time i kind of thought  that was the answer until i learned a little more about it um yeah the people who are screaming  
**[1:36:03-1:36:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:36:03):**  about packers and stalkers right now seem to want to give that to packers and stalkers  and it just i don't know i don't know i i think i like i said it goes back to i i'm  of the opinion we need to have some corporate feeders who are still more the old school  
**[1:36:23-1:36:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:36:23):**  who are just some yard managers who are maybe a little more old school and a little bit  more mean and just want to run a little more money out of each animal you know i don't  know they're they're they've got a lot of throughput and they want to lock in a margin  
**[1:36:38-1:36:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:36:38):**  and get the next margin going and they kind of look at it as a dollars in dollars out  lock a margin in but fight for every dollar guys just just be mean about it just kind  of push and and i think it would help the rest of the uh rest of the industry out so  
**[1:36:56-1:37:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:36:56):**  i don't know i i'm not too sure that our blame isn't misplaced and that's a that's not a  great thing to say but um i think us as cattlemen i think every cattleman's got to share some  of the blame because you know you've been here 12 years you've been doing it 12 years  
**[1:37:13-1:37:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:37:13):**  i've been i've been in the business since 2006 and let's be real i've been doing it  full time on my own about as long as you have there's a lot of guys that have been doing  it longer than you and me guys guys that i've talked to that are just now in the last couple  
**[1:37:27-1:37:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:37:27):**  of years since since the tyson fire and you know all the black swans of covid how how  many black swan events covid has been i think we're up to what four now three four yeah  yeah yeah you know there's been a lot of guys that have lived through that and there's even  
**[1:37:41-1:38:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:37:41):**  a few guys still around that remember quote the good old days before the check-off and  it's really it there's just not very many of us there's not very many people that have  been standing up since the beginning saying this is wrong we can't let things happen like  
**[1:38:02-1:38:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:38:02):**  this you know there's a few of them like mike calicrate and mike's a good guy i appreciate  his mind i do not agree with him 100 on everything and i think if we did that'd be dangerous but  he he's been here and he's one of the few voices that i can think of off top my head  
**[1:38:22-1:38:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:38:22):**  that ever since this this crap started in the early 80s he's been outspoken almost since  day one you know i'm sure bill bullard up at arkaf is another one and i'm sure there's  there's there's several others we've got to carry some of the blame as cattle and as cattle  
**[1:38:37-1:38:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:38:37):**  producers as as backgrounders as feeders as seed stock operators as cow calf producers  you know we've been silent too long we rolled over and let this happen you know what do  we do yeah that's the tricky part you know i i've had a lot of conversations i mean you  
**[1:38:58-1:39:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:38:58):**  say you're self-admitted podcast fan you've heard them i mean i've had the conversations  with a lot of folks and i wish i had an answer i don't i say it doesn't sound like anybody  settled on the silver bullet yet though and i i don't think they're there there isn't  
**[1:39:15-1:39:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:39:15):**  i mean it's too big to fail so the situation that we're we've got with the meat packers  being 80 to 85% consolidated they're being virtually no cash trade on fat cattle in most  of the country they're being a depressed feeder market a manipulated feeder market because  
**[1:39:33-1:39:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:39:33):**  you know it kind of bases back to the cow market or back to the fat market and there's  no competition and prices keep falling inputs keep going up i mean yeah we we've rolled  over and taken it for too long we got to do something about it but how do we fight it  
**[1:39:51-1:40:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:39:51):**  how do you fight a system that's basically too big to fail that repeatedly the government  refuses to get involved refuses to enforce the law refuses to investigate what do we  do i think i think the answer is to not play the game i think the answer is is to build  
**[1:40:11-1:40:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:40:11):**  our own pathways to market outside the packer and feeder system and you know as a grass  as as a producer that's trying to be 100% grass fed it's not easy and no matter how  much we try you know fisher grassley 50 14 the compromise bill uh transparency none of  
**[1:40:37-1:40:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:40:37):**  it matters at the end of the day i don't think any of it's going to really change that much  about the way the packers do business it might look better and feel better in the short term  but later down the line it's going to sting worse just stop playing the game that doesn't  
**[1:40:53-1:41:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:40:53):**  mean they're going to go away overnight even if cory booker and elizabeth warren get their  way they're not going to ban kfos overnight like they're not going away as gross as some  of them are they're going to be on the planet for a long time right i mean even the pig  
**[1:41:09-1:41:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:41:09):**  pig barns and chicken barns they're going to be here but they don't have to get any  bigger they don't have to get any bigger than they already are they can stay the same size  of problem and as time goes on and more people populate the earth we build alternative pathways  
**[1:41:26-1:41:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:41:26):**  to market their power gradually decreases and goes away right kodak you remember kodak  right used to make great cameras when we were kids where's kodak now they failed to adapt  to to changing market conditions they failed to adapt to a new technology that came up  
**[1:41:47-1:42:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:41:47):**  not saying there's a new technology coming up in cows or in grazing which i mean there  is some and hopefully we get into that here in a minute but there's not a there's not  a technological leap that's really going to transform the industry like that i don't think  
**[1:42:03-1:42:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:42:03):**  i think it's just going to have to be it's going to be a drift a slow drift but the faster  the better i wonder how they can keep going with labor and and uh i mean you know there  are already so many staffing problems at these plants and that's i mean i guess well well  
**[1:42:26-1:42:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:42:26):**  the argument is just pay them a fair wage right if you paid your employees a fair wage  they'd show up to work yeah yep you could make a lot of money working at a packing house  right now if you've seen some of their starting hours they're they're wanting to pay people  
**[1:42:40-1:43:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:42:40):**  i bet you anybody wanted to go work a gut table in dodge city right now probably make  a lot of money but not nobody right well that's the thing is i mean is and not uh i mean even  the migrant labor anymore is is kind of going you know doing what what migrations do i mean  
**[1:43:00-1:43:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:43:00):**  as you assimilate move on and it's just it's a it's a changing it's a changing job market  and they're not able to get people hired it just and you can you can have a robot if somebody  explained it to me you can have a robot kill a pig or a chicken because they're all the  
**[1:43:17-1:43:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:43:17):**  same size right and maybe they'll get there on some of these livestock but or you know  somebody's cattle but it's not there yet i think if don shiffle being the american angus  association had their way they'd all be identical cattle within 10 pounds well they're working  
**[1:43:34-1:43:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:43:34):**  on it with beef on dairy i guess but that's a that's a whole other tangent i could go  down but it sounds like another episode actually that's there's probably a two-hour episode  and i would have a lot of people mad at me if we talked about beef on terry write that  
**[1:43:49-1:44:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:43:49):**  down not uh no no sour grapes is the guy with red angus at all on that one that's fair that's  fair but uh but um yeah i you know like i said my my worry is though is whatever happens  and this will sound like i'm half measures and a little bit i am i don't want the change  
**[1:44:12-1:44:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:44:12):**  to be so radical and sudden that my bulk customers go broke that's my that's what gives me you  know if i was just you know joe schmoe guy with a with a stalker business or whatever  i'd probably be like you know what burn the whole thing down but i have too many people  
**[1:44:31-1:44:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:44:31):**  that are that are customers that sell into the market as it is and i got to keep them  in business now we got to change it we got to tweak it so they're making more money but  i don't know i don't know if there's something you know i don't know yeah i don't know we're  
**[1:44:48-1:45:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:44:48):**  not going to solve it here i don't think today nope probably not the oh our hour and 45 minutes  yeah so we've been dancing around something and um i know we spoke a few days ago and  it's it's kind of a fairly new system so if you just want to give us a kind of an overview  
**[1:45:11-1:45:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:45:11):**  of events and what you're hoping to accomplish with it yeah what what is it what is vince  so vince is something that i have wanted for a long time um it is it's so what it is is  it's virtual fencing so think of it as controlling animals it's precision agriculture for livestock  
**[1:45:33-1:45:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:45:33):**  grazing that's the best way i guess i can put it so our cows are wearing uh cheap it's  not actually gps it's it's am radio and then has some other things involved but um there  are a series of beeps and then a shock and we have video evidence of all of our family  
**[1:45:50-1:46:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:45:50):**  holding it and testing it out and it isn't going to it's less than even like a hot shot  or a or a solar fencer but it makes you drop the collar it's it's good times to give it  to your daughter and your wife in video um did you make them wear it and run to the far  
**[1:46:07-1:46:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:46:07):**  end of the yard we we uh we did have a piece of the yard done and then wanted to see like  how far the line was and how accurate it was it's it's good times i'd recommend it on itself  get get the system for for shocking your family okay good times um but what it allows you  
**[1:46:27-1:46:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:46:27):**  to do is um control grazing we already talked about how rocky it is how difficult it is  to manage here so instead of when we've we've been doing rotational grazing since the the  big drought kind of you know 10 years ago what does that look like in the flint hills  
**[1:46:45-1:47:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:46:45):**  where you you kind of use the pastures you already have it for you know i mean even pushing  in posts is awful like i can't go just i can't step pigtails in where i want to put them  it just doesn't that doesn't work um so you know we have this pasture that was was a uh  
**[1:47:05-1:47:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:47:05):**  a quarter this pasture that was a section this pasture that was a 900 or whatever it  is and so what you do is you just kind of rotate through the pastures as you have them  but that doesn't do much for the landscape and as i've told somebody our ranch if you  
**[1:47:19-1:47:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:47:19):**  look at it like on a google earth it actually kind of looks like the map of africa so it's  kind of big up on top it funnels down to that 400 acre fescue deal at the bottom and then  there's a couple a couple borders that are kind of creaks in here but by and large you  
**[1:47:35-1:47:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:47:35):**  get up to the top of it and it's just linear borders that crisscross through the open landscape  okay why are we managing this is a bigger you know kind of a more 30 000 40 80 000 foot  question that i like to i like to get into this is kind of where i like to think why  
**[1:47:56-1:48:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:47:56):**  are we managing those areas we are because that's where the fence is you know it doesn't  make sense to manage along those those uh those existing fences they don't really make  you know they make sense because two guys 100 years ago decided that's where that fence  
**[1:48:15-1:48:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:48:15):**  needed to be and that's where it's been ever since yeah it makes a lot more sense to me  to try to manage a drainage or a watershed than it does a square that was arbitrarily  drawn on a map without looking at the topographic lines or where you know we know that like  
**[1:48:33-1:48:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:48:33):**  in in our part of the world like we already mentioned there's areas of incredible thin  soil well then there's a lot of areas in those bottoms that have a lot deeper soil can grow  a lot more grass well if you're a cow would you like to graze the palatable deep grass  
**[1:48:48-1:49:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:48:48):**  it's 10 feet from the water site or would you like to go stand up on the side of the  rocky hill i'll go stand on side of the rocky hill where it's right and so you know and  so we we have utilization issues even if even if you crunch down into you know quote unquote  
**[1:49:03-1:49:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:49:03):**  crunch down into quarter sections which you know is a pain in the ass to fill a lot of  grazing you know you what are you talking about you know it's not even real managed  grazing well it's what we've got so it allows us to use like i said precision ag for grazing  
**[1:49:18-1:49:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:49:18):**  animals so with especially with it's called the raps data raps analysis platform that's  right well you talked about gpgi i figured you're on the raps train too that's right  i'm on the raps train and this if for everybody else who's already against big government  
**[1:49:39-1:49:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:49:39):**  guess what they already know they're how would you how would you feel if the government has  been taking a picture of your ranch every 16 days for the last 30 years measuring your  forage on your ranch they already have they already have but now we have the data that  
**[1:49:58-1:50:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:49:58):**  we can actually dig into it and find it and so you can either be as a libertarian a little  bit upset by that which is understandable but now that the genie is out of the bag you  can either bury your hand in the head in the sand or you can use that data i'm looking  
**[1:50:13-1:50:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:50:13):**  at it and go holy crap we need to change some things we're going to change some things and  so when and that was when i i didn't talk about it or when we i talked mainly about  forage samples you would ask if we had seen improvements the raps data shows that we've  
**[1:50:27-1:50:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:50:27):**  actually seen a lot of improvements on our area in our ranch on dry matter output i mean  we have real numbers that show it we've added about 400 pounds an acre output and so so  we combine these different technologies and we can apply the grazing pressure where we  
**[1:50:44-1:51:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:50:44):**  can we can back off of it where we can't so that's that's half of this equation that that  we're doing here is and that's the fun half i think for for me as a as a manager is really  dialing in my grazing to apply grazing almost as a prescription where it needs to be um  
**[1:51:05-1:51:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:51:05):**  okay okay so you're a data nerd i'm a data nerd everybody else lists things tune out  for about 30 seconds so how excited are you about looking at grazing heat maps versus  wraps forage production i think you look at them at the same time i i think grazing why  
**[1:51:23-1:51:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:51:23):**  so no grazing heat maps excite me a lot more that's a way more exciting thing to look at  but i think you use the wraps to build your heat map and then confirm your heat map on  the back side of it so i think they i i still think that you you're probably going to look  
**[1:51:38-1:51:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:51:38):**  at a lot more and probably make your probably draw your kml files a lot more accurately  with your apps and get you know as this thing goes i think we're we don't even know what  we don't know yet in terms of where we're going to pinch everything down i i think that's  
**[1:51:54-1:52:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:51:54):**  pretty sure um but yeah the idea of actual heat maps as opposed because it's like everything  else that's a reward like when you're actually you know eating that grass or you have that  like that's your money like you don't you don't get any benefit per say in just growing  
**[1:52:11-1:52:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:52:11):**  the grass right especially in the flint hills you're just going to set it on fire if you  don't use it you got to eat that grass and in order to gain a benefit of it um and so  to be able to to do that and a lot of this is driven too i mean i'm not sure we're going  
**[1:52:26-1:52:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:52:26):**  to go buy a bunch more flint hills grass because it's bringing too much can't afford it and  so what can we do to increase the efficiencies on our own ranch that we can increase animal  units and not have to do all the capital outlays of actually buying more ground and dealing  
**[1:52:43-1:53:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:52:43):**  with that whole thing um and so that's the exciting part now that's one exciting part  from maybe the bigger watershed i think excitement is what is the project that we're involved  with and this is i think pretty neat so we border um if anybody's ever been in chase  
**[1:53:06-1:53:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:53:06):**  county and been on the the tall grass nature preserve or the tall grass preserve it's it's  kind of off of 177 we border them on the west side okay it's kind of a uh it's a joint it's  a it's a national park that's owned mainly by the nature conservancy so kind of a third  
**[1:53:26-1:53:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:53:26):**  party ngo owns most of the grass um the government owns kind of the main site and then kind of  facilitates the rest of it being a part so i'll be the first to admit that there's been  years and past and people that worked at the park in the past we probably acted like a  
**[1:53:45-1:54:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:53:45):**  bunch of chase county ends with um meaning we get pretty combative this is a better way  in my opinion so they have a list of concerns and their list of concerns looks like you  know uh wildlife habitat riparian zones and maybe we can graze grass because the grass  
**[1:54:08-1:54:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:54:08):**  needs to be grazed as a rancher i'll have a list of demands it's demands a list of things  i'd like to see you know first i have to have the grass graze because that's how i pay the  bank and you know if i improve my riparian zones what makes sense because you know it'll  
**[1:54:25-1:54:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:54:25):**  ultimately be more grazing and less erosion and better water quality and so there's some  things there and then wildlife habitat is probably least on that list of three is probably  the lowest one but i mean it's not going to hurt me to have more prey chickens for example  
**[1:54:38-1:54:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:54:38):**  i don't think chickens ever hurt anybody right and so we could look at this in two ways um  i could look at tnc's list and say well your list is out of order you dummies you don't  know how you're doing this and they could do the same to me or we could look at this  
**[1:54:55-1:55:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:54:55):**  project and say hey you know what we each have the same list you know we we all care  about the same things yeah we have the order in a different way but what is a tool we can  use we start managing landscapes as opposed to managing you know just physical structure  
**[1:55:13-1:55:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:55:13):**  in terms of a pasture you know how can we manage landscapes the best and vents is a  product is a product that's going to let us do that so we collar cows on our place and  then um and then on they go on the on the park side as well with collared cattle and  
**[1:55:32-1:55:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:55:32):**  yearlings don't work with this yet um the training period takes too long and and mexican  yearlings that come into the flint hills are just too dumb and wild it just doesn't work  um so we sent a bunch of dumb tame registered cows is what we did so we can control so we  
**[1:55:49-1:56:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:55:49):**  were doing riparian studies on their side and just as importantly on our side so we're  we're doing riparian zone studies we're doing uh manage habitat for wildlife and through  the increase in grazing efficiencies we managed to keep the grazing units the same so what  
**[1:56:10-1:56:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:56:10):**  that does is what I mentioned too is like how I sell bulls I want to manage outcomes  where everybody wins and so how do we do that we have virtual fencing that's how we do that  so the tnc we manage a landscape with them and we have more prairie chickens we have  
**[1:56:27-1:56:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:56:27):**  more just you know kind of real adaptable I don't say movable because they won't they'll  move but it'll it'll be slow I mean there's there's there's some things we can do with  wildlife that that are that we can't do with hot rope and we can't do a permanent fence  
**[1:56:46-1:57:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:56:46):**  is the last thing we don't need more permanent fence because that's how all these woody invasives  come in to the flint hills and and so this is a this is really kind of a big um as I've  told more than one person I don't know if I can tell you that the outcome is decided  
**[1:57:04-1:57:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:57:04):**  on this yet whether the the affordability of events or long-term us working with a third  party that with a different set of goals but at the end of this five years ultimately what  I want in terms of my ranch or chase county or the state of Kansas or grasslands and Argentina  
**[1:57:26-1:57:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:57:26):**  with some of my buddies whoever it is I want all the opportunities for a rancher to make  money and how do we do that if how do we how do we do that more efficiently how do we do  that maybe in a different way this could be a possible avenue and this is a different  
**[1:57:46-1:58:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:57:46):**  way of doing things and this is also a different way and like I said tnc is happy because we're  gonna we're gonna make more prairie chickens you know we're gonna protect some streams  you know those cattle standing in streams that doesn't do me any more good than any  
**[1:58:02-1:58:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:58:02):**  of the animals that might be living in that stream you know that's just all they're gonna  do is get foot rot and they're not out grazing yep I've told more people kind of tongue-in-cheek  you know I don't have black ones they don't need to stand in the water at three in the  
**[1:58:14-1:58:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:58:14):**  afternoon they can go out and eat yeah they don't stand in the shade they don't stand  in the water they're out working mostly they don't stick it in the shade because I cut  all the trees down but that's right and we're working on that too but you know even this  
**[1:58:26-1:58:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:58:26):**  vents project that works well so and so like the the GPGI tree removal types we know a  lot of these programs for people that aren't familiar with them you that's great plains  grassland initiative yes and just for a second we we're gonna mention it I'm gonna put a  
**[1:58:47-1:59:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:58:47):**  link in the show notes and I'm also gonna put a link to RAP's rangeland analysis program  so y'all listeners can go check those out and maybe we'll circle back and do do some  episodes on I've I've been trying I've emailed direct twitwell twice he should do a show  
**[1:59:03-1:59:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:59:03):**  I wish you'd turn my email Dean Crable we should do one too come on talk about it I  think Dean just sent me a friend request on Facebook this morning there you go that'll  probably be the easy perfect perfect and so part of those oh it's not it looks as trees  
**[1:59:25-1:59:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:59:25):**  as a pest so you don't just cut down the tree then you're done there's a monitoring there's  a certain time years afterwards that you have to make sure there's no regrowth so you can  go through there with expensive chemical and do all that or you can use vents set exclusion  
**[1:59:39-1:59:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:59:39):**  zones grow some grass around those sites and then kill those saplings with fire and so  that's what I look for in technologies is things is I look at all these different things  that we do as systems so I have a genetic component of our ranch it's a system and our  
**[1:59:55-2:00:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=1:59:55):**  grazing as a system what works is things that kind of interlock these systems and virtual  fencing is something that lets us do multiple multiple issues or address multiple issues  simultaneously you know I I think you want to talk about probably a good use of government  
**[2:00:17-2:00:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=2:00:17):**  money if you want to get in like NRCS I think they should be funding this because what you  know they right now they'll pay to have a grazing plan they should fund to put the towers  everywhere absolutely landowners pay for the callers just build out the infrastructure  
**[2:00:34-2:00:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=2:00:34):**  build the expensive let us carry the cost absolutely should I think it'd be a great  idea because you know and in terms of like grazing plans or any of these other things  that you can do through equip or or state cost share any of these what other program  
**[2:00:51-2:01:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=2:00:51):**  would they ever have that they could see you implement it at a high high high degree and  have real world data collection they would never have to come out and do a read you know  just send them over the file at the end of the year and show them what you did on your  
**[2:01:04-2:01:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=2:01:04):**  grazing plan yeah and your grazing plan would be phenomenal it'd be head and shoulders above  anything you've done to date and with the grazing heat map that's generated off the  digital caller data and GPS timestamps you can prove you didn't over graze something  
**[2:01:20-2:01:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=2:01:20):**  you can prove that you rested something long enough yeah and and so that's where you know  that's a little bit of a tangent but that's that's what we're doing and that's honestly  this has been kind of a big project for us it's it's exciting one of my brothers just  
**[2:01:36-2:01:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=2:01:36):**  came back in January I mean this was a big enough project that we added a sibling to  the ranch for this and as anybody knows with a small family business when you add another  family member it's a big deal because you don't have you don't have a plan B I mean  
**[2:01:52-2:02:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=2:01:52):**  you have to make something work when their last name is your name right and so that's  that's something that we're kind of ho-hog on right now and and we don't know like we  just got the towers built here a week ago we've got everything out they're turned on  
**[2:02:10-2:02:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=2:02:10):**  we're playing with them honestly I don't even know what I don't know yet yeah I do know  we circle back later and I'm gonna I do know that like those cows are four miles away from  the ranch but the day I wean those fall calves they're gonna be standing at my house I'm  
**[2:02:29-2:02:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=2:02:29):**  gonna I'm gonna and if I have to get a rodeo out of it we're going to just for fun but  we have a set of collared cows in the middle of another set of cows that will be weaning  the calves and I'm gonna see just from a management standpoint if I can't take one set of cows  
**[2:02:43-2:03:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=2:02:43):**  move them to another side of a pasture and then over the course of a day or two move  another set of cows through their pasture through two sets of gates and bring them up  to the set of pens four miles that's cool it's awesome it's it's really great I try  
**[2:03:01-2:03:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=2:03:01):**  not to sit here and think too much about how I would use them because I don't have any  yet yeah but it's it's uh it's the future I I'm well you know I think in 50 years every  animal in the in the country will probably it won't even be a collar probably an ear  
**[2:03:18-2:03:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=2:03:18):**  tag or something that that does all this um but we have to adapt I think everybody knows  you know long-term prospects of making money in the livestock industry is it's a break-even  business and so if you aren't trying to be a little bit better and get a little bit more  
**[2:03:37-2:03:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=2:03:37):**  out of what you're doing you're not going to be successful yeah and that's and that's  why we're doing that you know it's almost a benefit of doing it that it's so cool because  if it was a headache we're still gonna have to do it because we don't want to go broke  
**[2:03:51-2:04:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=2:03:51):**  um but this one is unlike some of the other things we do that are a pain in the butt this  one is something I've wanted conceptually for a long time and and now we've got it and  um like I said the possibility of the the way we're working with tnc I think opening  
**[2:04:08-2:04:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=2:04:08):**  up new models um I think you know because everybody can talk about you know these third  party types coming in um like I said the tnc is can be an easy target for people believe  it or not as a rancher you share a lot more goals with tnc than you do say a deer hunter  
**[2:04:28-2:04:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=2:04:28):**  from texas I would I would die on that hill with you sir and and so I mean these guys  are a set of people if you really do care about your ranch you can find some common  goals and work with some of these some of these sort of groups I don't be turned off  
**[2:04:45-2:04:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=2:04:45):**  by the coexist sticker on the back of their Subaru they're really good that's right you  know because at the end of the day too they're they're people have more money than you do  oh yeah I mean they will beat you if you don't join them I I really do think that's you know  
**[2:04:58-2:05:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=2:04:58):**  that's that is the case and so um you know you're not going to work with a deer hunter  he's going to grow up brush and kick all the cows off yeah and and so you know to his own  detriment I'd argue but that's neither here nor there I mean that's they're they're managing  
**[2:05:13-2:05:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=2:05:13):**  for a different outcome I'll I'll piss off the all the deer hunters that may or may not  listen to the show I mean I totally get what you're saying I see it happen here all the  time and well come out and they'll buy a piece of property out here where the deer good and  
**[2:05:29-2:05:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=2:05:29):**  land is cheap because you know they're from the city and they have small shitty deer in  Louisiana Texas whatever fine the problem is is they watch you know they'll watch like  a couple hours of you know deer hunter tv from a show in Georgia and they'll get this  
**[2:05:48-2:06:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=2:05:48):**  idea that if they let the trees grow up it'll attract deer okay that's true to a certain  point you know that's one of those dogmatic things that gets dumbed down and then taken  back out of context and misinterpreted so are trees good for deer some trees are good  
**[2:06:07-2:06:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=2:06:07):**  for deer which trees are good for deer well the ones that provide a food source acorns  oaks walnuts things like that where they can get some food off of it cedar trees elms catalpas  Kentucky coffee bean trees Osage orange you don't eat that shit that's not good deer habitat  
**[2:06:26-2:06:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=2:06:26):**  yeah yep well another thing that gets me is they'll like the hunters will say oh don't  cut down a cedars it's good deer cover well it's good deer cover they'll hide behind them  so you can't see them right if you think that blind goes both ways you think that brown  
**[2:06:43-2:06:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=2:06:43):**  deer is going to go go stand in front of that green cedar tree you're dumber and you look  that brown deer is laid down in my three foot tall brown grass and you won't see him yeah  he's not going over there yeah so that's you know and we're seeing that more and more here  
**[2:06:58-2:07:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=2:06:58):**  too and it's it's a you know it's a problem it's in fact I'd say it's probably a bigger  problem than the sericea lespedeza and the in the old world bluestem is maybe who's buying  some of the ground in the first place and that's that's not very politically correct  
**[2:07:14-2:07:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=2:07:14):**  of me to say it but and that ties back to to RAPS and some of the things that we you  know we understand from RAPS and GPGI and what I'm talking about is we're losing the  great plains yes now recently we're losing the great plains we're losing our native prairies  
**[2:07:32-2:07:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=2:07:32):**  faster to brush encroachment than we ever lost them to conversion to arable farmland  and that that's scary and those and it's not being done in those situations by accident  and that's the maddening part to me is they are managing an outcome just as I am but our  
**[2:07:52-2:08:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=2:07:52):**  outcomes are so opposed to what they are to each other that I don't see I don't see how  we bridge that gap you know and it's not it's not like you know it is not like okay you  want to buy your own piece of ground and you're going to let it grow up the brush and trees  
**[2:08:11-2:08:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=2:08:11):**  and then like they respect my wishes to stop at this at the fence either no you know it  just it it doesn't work and so I I I don't know I I would like to see the state of Kansas  maybe change this because a lot of this too is we're encouraging some of these guys to  
**[2:08:29-2:08:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=2:08:29):**  come in here just by the way we write our tags but then again you got to put on that  gold hat with an orcupine on it and go small government what yeah I know it I know it but  you know if you are a big government guy and you want to make some money though to me you  
**[2:08:45-2:09:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=2:08:45):**  would model your your hunting permits after some of the big game states so you know Alaska,  Montana, Colorado they do a pretty good job using hunting as a revenue source I'd say  better than Kansas you can't go as an out-of-state landowner get a guaranteed draw with a hunt  
**[2:09:05-2:09:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=2:09:05):**  on your own land tenant tag just because you own a little piece there you don't get that  guaranteed tag at that discounted rate and if your brother-in-law wants to buy a horse  and throw it out there he doesn't get that tag at a tenant guaranteed rate either at  
**[2:09:20-2:09:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=2:09:20):**  those states and you shouldn't get an agricultural exemption exactly right so there's some things  we're going to have to change in the state of Kansas I think to to change with the times  unfortunately but that's neither here nor there I suppose but yeah I'm with you on that  
**[2:09:37-2:09:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=2:09:37):**  so but it's been a great afternoon you're ready to go get back to work yeah I gotta  go pull cedars here in a bit so whole cedars c-i-d-r-s which is related to breeding cedars  as in eastern red cedar trees that's right that's right I'll be pulling cedars this winter  
**[2:09:56-2:10:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=2:09:56):**  with the c-e-d-a-r-s I guess but you know we we because we are registered we breed we  breed everything ai at least once and so now the good thing is with the fescue I'm putting  all these young pairs down there and then we have a facility there so it's less of a  
**[2:10:15-2:10:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=2:10:15):**  less of a rodeo than it used to be so we're going to go walk them through the facility  down there have a nice bud box and and it shouldn't be too much but it's it's like everything  else I mean don't you want to catch every cow four times before you turn her out one  
**[2:10:30-2:10:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=2:10:30):**  last time for the summer oh yeah we just need to run them back through the pens just one  more time one more trip through the chute that's it's you know I actually I like it  it's I told somebody else to me it's maybe one of the most optimistic things we do because  
**[2:10:47-2:11:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=2:10:47):**  if you weren't optimistic for the future why the heck would you ai your cows because it's  so much it's so much work involved but in the actual I don't mind doing it but it doesn't  mean that it's it doesn't mean that I need to go get to it here so all right fair enough  
**[2:11:05-2:11:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=2:11:05):**  I'll let you get to it I really appreciate your time today Daniel it's been a lot of  fun it went fast it was really enjoyable and I won't listen to this one but I at some point  I want to turn the tables I have a lot of questions on on like what goes into one of  
**[2:11:20-2:11:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/69-Daniel-Mushrush-Managing-Virgin-Prairie-e1k23j8#t=2:11:20):**  these things you're not one of you work on this now I don't want to talk about it on  air but you're not the first you're not the first person that's asked me some of these  questions that that day's coming that day's coming where I gave you that's another idea

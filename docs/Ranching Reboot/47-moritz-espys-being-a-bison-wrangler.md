**[0:01:40-0:01:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:01:40):**  Sorry.  All right.  Hey, Mort.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:01:43):**  Okay.  Hi, Mort.  Let me get everything muted.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:01:48):**  Good to see you.  How you been?  I've been really good.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:01:52):**  Been really good.  Winter hasn't been too terrible.  Had a couple of cold snaps.  
**[0:01:57-0:02:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:01:57):**  It's dry down here.  Yeah.  Better up there?  
**[0:02:02-0:02:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:02:02):**  We've had a little cold.  It was warm during...  I killed a snake in December.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:02:06):**  Wow.  Really?  So, yeah, it was warm in December and then we got cold over Christmas and then over the  
**[0:02:12-0:02:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:02:12):**  new year and then it's 50 degrees again today.  That's crazy.  In South Dakota, right?  
**[0:02:18-0:02:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:02:18):**  Yep.  Yeah.  That's what I'm talking about.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:02:22):**  What part of South Dakota are you in for our listeners?  Our listeners?  The ranch is in Southwest or South...  
**[0:02:33-0:02:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:02:33):**  Yeah, Southwest South Dakota.  We're very close to Rapid City.  We're about 35 miles south of Rapid City towards Nebraska.  
**[0:02:43-0:03:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:02:43):**  We're right on the edge of the Black Hills.  You can see Mount Rushmore from the ranch, but it's only about that big.  So we are where it converts from Plains to Badlands.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:03:00):**  So we have a diverse mix of very different types of grazing.  Pretty big operation too, right?  Can you go through how big the ranch is?  
**[0:03:16-0:03:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:03:16):**  We're about 28,000 acres.  We're all contiguous and we use a holistic management.  We do plan grazing, high intensity, low duration.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:03:30):**  Our stock densities are a lot lower than a lot of guys, but we've been doing that for  about 30 years.  I've been on the ranch for dang near 20 now.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:03:41):**  So yeah, that's what we do.  It's 100% bison.  We've got some therapy donkeys that roam the ranch, about eight of those.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:03:51):**  But other than that, it's all bison.  The donkeys don't hang out with the bison?  Not very much.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:03:58):**  Not very often.  Sometimes they do.  Depends on their mood.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:04:02):**  Yeah.  Donkeys are mercurial, right?  That's right.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:04:08):**  So how many head of bison do you see you guys run up there?  Currently, we're running about 1500 head of adults.  And then we'll have pretty close to about 800 head of calves in the spring.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:04:24):**  So just a little tiny herd, you know, just feed them out of the backyard.  1500 head to somebody with cows, to the amount of cows that there are in the world, 1500  head is nothing.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:04:40):**  How does that compare to bison?  How big is the bison herd in the United States?  I guess North America?  
**[0:04:47-0:05:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:04:47):**  So North American bison herd, they say is right around a half a million.  So and the majority of that is in private ownership.  According to the last MBA numbers, you know, the average bison producer in the United States,  
**[0:05:03-0:05:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:05:03):**  I think had 18 head.  And then if you take Ted Turner out of that equation, I think the number falls to like  12 or something like that.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:05:15):**  So you know, we are an anomaly, you know, we're an anomaly across the industry.  But as far as Western United States goes, you know, especially South Dakota, South Dakota  has, you know, the most bison in the lower, you know, most bison producers per state.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:05:36):**  And then, you know, we're holding them, we're holding the most bison in South Dakota.  I think most producers are in Texas.  I was gonna say Texas and South Dakota seems to be always where my bison folks are at.  
**[0:05:54-0:06:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:05:54):**  So that's confirming right there.  So yeah, number of producers is in Texas, but number of bison is in South Dakota.  I like the statistic you said that like the average herd size is around 18.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:06:08):**  But if you take out Ted Turner, it goes really small.  I think I saw a statistic within the last month or so that the average cattle owner  has like 42 head.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:06:21):**  So just for comparison, right.  But you know, if you think about it, you know, there's a lot of cattle on the on the east  side of the Mississippi, and a lot of them are in small little herds and you know, on  
**[0:06:35-0:06:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:06:35):**  small acreages.  Oh, yeah.  And then I'm sure that's what drives that number down.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:06:41):**  Right.  Normally probably in Texas people want just to have, you know, a couple of bison around.  That's, yeah, I think they get into them.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:06:51):**  I think they get into them to train their horses on cutting horses and then, oh, and  then they grow up and then they fall in love with them.  They keep them.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:06:58):**  So, you know,  a bison is pretty handy.  A bison can get around a horse pretty easy, can it?  
**[0:07:05-0:07:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:07:05):**  Yeah, well, you know, the cutting horse folks like them because they're got a little more  energy and a little more stamina to them.  So yeah, but as far as getting around a horse, I think it's all depends on the rider.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:07:23):**  So they can flat move in a straight line.  They can.  They are quick.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:07:28):**  They move more like a horse, you know, because there's a lot of the body weight is right  up on the shoulders.  And you know, like on a cow, you know, like the flexion point on a cow is, you know, just  
**[0:07:49-0:07:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:07:49):**  behind the shoulder, you know.  Like their neck, right?  Almost.  
**[0:07:53-0:07:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:07:53):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  You got to get right up dang near on the shoulder before they flex.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:07:58):**  But anyways, a cow's, a bison's eyes are offset to the side just a little bit more.  And so their flexion point moves back on their body.  So they're, they're going to turn more and then they've got more body weight up on that  
**[0:08:10-0:08:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:08:10):**  front quarters.  And so they turn more like a horse.  And you know, and then in a herd, you know, they kind of behave more like a like, like  
**[0:08:21-0:08:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:08:21):**  sheep, you know, because if one turns around, they all turn around.  You don't know where they're going.  They're just going there full speed.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:08:28):**  They're just going.  Yep.  That's right.  
**[0:08:31-0:08:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:08:31):**  I thought you were going to say they're like sheep, they want to die.  No.  Well, yeah, sometimes they just, they just do.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:08:38):**  It just seems like no matter what you do, whenever something's worth money, they just  want to die.  Yeah.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:08:45):**  They're not worth anything.  They'll live forever.  Especially when feed's high and they're not worth anything.  
**[0:08:52-0:09:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:08:52):**  Yeah.  Especially that, especially that.  So since the bison market is so small, like I wanted to ask about how do you market bison  
**[0:09:02-0:09:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:09:02):**  and how, what is the bison market look like?  How do you make money on them?  Well, it's agriculture and it's niche agriculture and the internet and a couple of companies,  
**[0:09:19-0:09:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:09:19):**  one company in particular, a Judd Seaman at Quality Auctions.  He's really, he's really been pushing online auctions hard and been doing a lot of it.  Now before online auctions and video auctions, he really caught on in the bison industry.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:09:37):**  You just had to market them yourself over the phone or take them to a local or not local,  but a regional show or member association auction.  There was a couple of larger, like Missouri's a big one.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:09:58):**  Saskatchewan's got one up there, Cramer's and North Dakota's got one where you can just  use to be able to open consign.  They're still open.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:10:07):**  You can take them there live and sell them that way.  But we don't have a weekly market like you would with cattle.  You can't liquidate them next week.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:10:17):**  It takes some planning and that's just selling on the open.  But most people when they market their bison is from producer to consumer.  So direct sales through farmer's markets, direct sales through field harvest, selling  
**[0:10:38-0:10:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:10:38):**  halves and quarters.  There's a whole lot of people selling animals that way.  And like us, we were primarily a cow calf operation for many, many years and we weaned  
**[0:10:52-0:11:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:10:52):**  our calves, sent them on to either somebody who would run them as yearlings on grass or  put them in a feedlot and punch them through to slaughter wheat and they would sell them  on a rail.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:11:07):**  And then we also dabbled in all the mistakes you make in any agriculture.  Well, prices aren't that good.  Let's put them on feed and retain ownership and take them all the way and just prolong  
**[0:11:20-0:11:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:11:20):**  the pain there.  Or like right now we're partnering with a strategic partner who has a website that's  devoted to grass fed holistically managed meat sources.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:11:38):**  He's doing elk, bison, some beef now, some pork.  And so we have a partnership there.  And so the majority of our animals goes through that website.  
**[0:11:49-0:12:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:11:49):**  So we're keeping them and we're running them on grass and then pulling them off as two  year olds and killing them as two year olds.  And they're coming in at 1,000 to 1,200 pounds and we're going that way.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:12:05):**  I mean, that's pretty similar to grass fed situations then, right?  Or finished.  Yeah.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:12:11):**  What is the slaughter like though?  Yeah.  The slaughter, do you have to have a totally different type of facility to put them through  
**[0:12:21-0:12:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:12:21):**  like a knockbox and stuff or is it the same?  Oh, it was very similar.  You know, a lot of the bison facilities got an extra rail over the top.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:12:31):**  Oh, that's all it is.  Yeah.  I was thinking extra tall and extra secure.

**[0:12:52-0:13:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:12:52):**  How far do you have to go to your processor?  A long ways.  The largest, let's see, I'll do the top five guys.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:13:07):**  So the top five guys, there's two in Colorado, one out in Brush, Colorado, one just outside  of Fort Collins.  And then there's a guy in, where'd the UFO land in New Mexico?  
**[0:13:25-0:13:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:13:25):**  Roswell.  Roswell.  Roswell.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:13:28):**  And there's one in Idaho, and there's one in Wisconsin, and one in New Rochford, North  Dakota out in the middle of it.  It's not next to the interstate, it's north of the interstate aways off in North Dakota.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:13:43):**  And then Rapid City, South Dakota, there's a pretty good plant here.  So yeah, part of my Buffalo go 773 miles and the other ones go 250 miles and some of them  go 35 miles.  
**[0:13:56-0:14:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:13:56):**  So it just depends on who's killing and who has the slots and which animals were doing.  So, complicated question.  I'm thinking back to a number you threw at me sometime over the last year when we were  
**[0:14:14-0:14:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:14:14):**  talking about how long would it take to kill all the bison if we killed them as fast as  we kill cattle every week?  So yeah, the amount of bison that are killed all year long would be killed before 10 o'clock  
**[0:14:33-0:14:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:14:33):**  on the first day of business if we killed them like we did cattle.  So we only-  The yearly harvest, not getting rid of all of them.  
**[0:14:41-0:14:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:14:41):**  Yeah, the yearly harvest.  So I think last year, I think we were up to like 36 to 40,000 head of Buffalo under inspection  killed.  
**[0:14:52-0:15:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:14:52):**  And so yeah, you think about they do three, four or five times that a day in the United  States on the beef side.  So pretty small market, just say 40,000 head killed under inspection.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:15:07):**  That's not a lot.  No, that's when we do 600,000 cattle a week, every week, every good 40,000 bison a year.  A year.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:15:21):**  Yep.  So it's a pretty small number.  And everybody that's in the business is like family because there's just-  
**[0:15:30-0:15:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:15:30):**  The small network.  Yeah.  Small network.  
**[0:15:35-0:15:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:15:35):**  So.  So we haven't said the name of the ranch yet.  Have we done that for a reason?  
**[0:15:41-0:15:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:15:41):**  I don't think we even got into it.  I got a sliver in my finger.  We went into it.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:15:45):**  Yeah.  We just rolled right into it.  That's our style.  
**[0:15:48-0:16:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:15:48):**  Nope.  I'm more for you guys that don't know me, I'm Moritz Espy.  I'm the manager at 777 Ranch in Hermosa, Fairburn, Rapid City, South Dakota.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:16:01):**  28,000 acres.  We're all bison.  It's owned by the Hillenbrands.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:16:05):**  I work for Mimi Hillenbrand.  One of the best bosses I've ever had because I just haven't left yet.  So-  
**[0:16:14-0:16:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:16:14):**  I've heard described as a bad ass raptor driving hippie chick.  Yep.  Bad ass raptor driving hippie chick.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:16:22):**  That's about right.  I love her.  Her email sign off, it says chasing bison on the planes.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:16:28):**  Her signature.  I'm like, yes, that's right there.  Yep.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:16:33):**  Yep.  She's pretty cool.  She's at her other place in South America right now.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:16:39):**  So- Patagonia, right?  Yep.  Down there where it's beautiful.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:16:42):**  It's just beautiful down there.  Yeah.  Being Patagonia for their summer and then South Dakota for their summer.  
**[0:16:50-0:16:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:16:50):**  I could dig that.  Yeah.  I could dig that.  
**[0:16:55-0:17:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:16:55):**  So wasn't Dances with Wolves filmed on part of that ranch when it was under previous ownership,  of course?  No, it was the same owners.  
**[0:17:06-0:17:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:17:06):**  Dwayne Lammers was the manager at that time.  That was in the early 90s.  Okay.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:17:11):**  It was under the same ownership and yeah, the kill scenes were filmed there.  So when Cody the Buffalo was running across at the kid holding the reins of the horse,  he was holding the horses and he jumps out and he shoots him and he falls and he slides  
**[0:17:28-0:17:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:17:28):**  to him.  And then the bison where they're getting hit with the arrows and they slip and they slide  and the dirt comes up.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:17:40):**  That was done in the corrals and out in the pasture.  So kind of interesting there.  If you watch, you'll notice they all fall the same direction because what they did is  
**[0:17:54-0:18:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:17:54):**  they pasted the arrows, put the arrow on them, stuck it to them.  And so they had an arrow sticking out their side and they took a bunch of plywood in the  alleyway and made a corner.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:18:07):**  They put a bunch of plywood down and made like a little dance floor and they greased  it and covered it with dirt and they would let one out and it would run down the alleyway  and run around the corner with its arrow sticking out of it and down he went.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:18:25):**  And that's how they filmed that.  And that's how they made them all fall down.  Interesting.  
**[0:18:30-0:18:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:18:30):**  I hope none of them got hurt.  No, I don't know.  It was in the 90s.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:18:35):**  Who knows?  I don't know.  But no, if it was a union project, there was PETA people or somebody watching all the time.  
**[0:18:48-0:19:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:18:48):**  So they don't let you get it.  We've done commercials and movies and we just did last year that Netflix special, Our Planet  was out.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:19:01):**  Oh, wow.  So we were part of that.  And so on those bigger jobs, there's always somebody there making sure the animals are  
**[0:19:08-0:19:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:19:08):**  taken care of.  But usually that's our decision.  Yeah, they've been run too much or it's too hot or this is completely enough.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:19:16):**  You guys are just annoying the shit out of us with all your stupid requests and we're  going to quit for the day.  My funniest story is when those people come, you're called a wrangler.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:19:28):**  You're an animal wrangler.  Oh, yeah.  And this is what they do.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:19:35):**  Wranglers come in.  Wranglers, come in.  We need to talk to you.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:19:40):**  And so that's how they wrangle the wranglers.  And of course, you can kind of imagine the crew that we have together.  I'm sure he met a couple of them.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:19:49):**  You've met Justin and Cody, haven't you?  Yeah, I met the, if they're the same guys that were there when I visited about, I think  it was about a year ago.  
**[0:19:56-0:19:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:19:56):**  Yep.  Yep.  Same guys.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:19:59):**  So yeah, you do that to them.  You know, they probably weren't impressed.  There's other effective ways to communicate that you need to go there.  
**[0:20:10-0:20:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:20:10):**  So yeah.  And another funny story.  Is this G-rated?  
**[0:20:16-0:20:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:20:16):**  No.  No.  Okay.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:20:19):**  So we were doing a deal and Justin was there and somebody told him to pick up something  and move it.  And of course, you know, he did it the first time to be nice because he's a country kid  
**[0:20:31-0:20:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:20:31):**  and is well mannered.  And the second time he kind of got irritated.  And then the third time they got a little more gruff with him.  
**[0:20:38-0:20:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:20:38):**  And he says, you know, you can just move your own shit.  And anyways, the guy comes over and he talks to me and he says, you know what that guy  told me?  
**[0:20:47-0:20:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:20:47):**  And I said, well, what'd he tell you?  And I said, well, maybe you should move your own shit.  That was too funny, but you know, you got to stick together.  
**[0:20:57-0:21:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:20:57):**  So anyways, it's always a good time.  We're different.  We're raising Buffalo and we're trying to, you know, do things holistically and follow  
**[0:21:07-0:21:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:21:07):**  our grazing plan and save the environment and stop climate change.  So that's what we're doing.  Just with Buffalo.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:21:15):**  We're just doing it different.  We can't be normal.  We can't just run.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:21:21):**  It's all kind of folk.  What does regenerative grazing with bison look like?  Do you have the place broken up into paddocks or you're rotating them frequently or you  
**[0:21:31-0:21:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:21:31):**  heard them around?  What, what does that look like on the triple seven?  Yeah, we're running 27 cramps or 32.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:21:40):**  I think 32 paddocks right now.  I lose track of how many I have sometimes.  It's fine.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:21:46):**  Anyways.  Yeah.  You know, several paddocks and we're rotating them through.  
**[0:21:51-0:22:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:21:51):**  We are, our threshold is 60 days of rest, but our target is, is closer to 120 days.  And I think we've been averaging, I think this year during the drought, our average  rest was like 112 days.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:22:05):**  So we're hitting it twice in the growing season and twice in the non-growing season.  About every three, four days.  Yeah.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:22:14):**  So how are you moving them?  Well, sometimes you just, well, with, with plan grazing, you know, if you do it right,  you just open the gate and they move themselves.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:22:27):**  So you know, we use four wheelers, Cody, four wheelers and dogs.  Cody or Justin or the whole team depends on which pasture it is and how it lays out and  how it flows.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:22:42):**  But most times it's just Cody by himself, just moving animals around and, and it takes,  you know, one, two guys to pick up and move mineral.  So that's about it.  
**[0:22:53-0:23:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:22:53):**  Change floats.  It takes longer to change floats and, and check fence than it does to move the animals.  Right.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:23:00):**  That's great.  Cause they're wanting to move.  I can agree with that.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:23:05):**  So when I visited, one of the things we went and looked at was some of your water infrastructure.  Have you made some changes since then?  And I want to, I don't want to talk about like the challenges that you've had watering  
**[0:23:17-0:23:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:23:17):**  that many animals at a time with the, with the water that you have available.  No, we haven't made any changes.  We've got a plan.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:23:27):**  We've got to, I've been working with us for several years with the NRCS because I didn't  want to pay an engineer to do it.  And I wanted my tax dollars to do it.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:23:37):**  So we've, we've got a plan put together.  We just either need to start implementing that plan and going through that way.  So, so we'll, we've got a good plan in place, but right now we're still just using what  
**[0:23:53-0:24:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:23:53):**  we can with what we got, where we're at, which you saw, which was moving tanks, portable  tanks, semi trailers, large storage chicken drinkers and, and making it work.  So is that eating up a lot of man hours or is that effective?  
**[0:24:11-0:24:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:24:11):**  Yeah, it's, it's just enough to get by.  It's you know, right now our water is our weakest link in the chain.  So it's our limiting factor.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:24:24):**  You want to talk a little bit about how that like, what kind of water system you're on,  how much you can get and how you got around it to water that many, many animals.  So way back when in the eighties, when times were tough, there was a water association  
**[0:24:44-0:24:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:24:44):**  come through.  It was a large community project.  And so we've got rural water that comes from a deep well in the Hills and serves, I don't  
**[0:24:53-0:25:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:24:53):**  know, a hundred and some people, including us.  Well, when that was designed, it was using the knowledge of the day, which was three  gallons a minute and set, stop grazing.  
**[0:25:10-0:25:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:25:10):**  And so that's the way the system was designed.  So a lot of mice, but taps, you know, I've got a three quarter inch Woodford, Iowa, whatever  you guys call them, the orange ones, frost hydrants.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:25:25):**  And a lot of those just flow three gallons a minute.  Some of them can flow up to 15.  Just depends on where they're at on an auxiliary line, but the whole system was set up for  
**[0:25:37-0:25:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:25:37):**  each hydrant to have three gallons a minute.  So with high density, low duration grazing, LARP or whatever you want to call it, holistic  plan grazing, you've got a large amount of animals in one pasture for a short amount  
**[0:25:55-0:26:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:25:55):**  of time.  Well, the system was designed for a larger pasture with fewer animals for longer time.  So what I've done is I've got trailer pups that used to haul sand or cement, they're  
**[0:26:12-0:26:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:26:12):**  pneumatic trailers.  I don't know how else.  Like aluminum with a V bottom.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:26:17):**  With a V bottom.  And then I've got some water tankers that I've bought and some old milk trailers and  oil trailers and things like that.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:26:25):**  And so I move those around and I pre-fill those.  And then the three quarter inch hydrant fills those tanks.  And then off of that comes a two inch suction hose, hard suction hose, goes to a two inch  
**[0:26:41-0:26:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:26:41):**  float.  And that's what keeps the water level up.  Because there's a great deal of psychology with animals drinking water.  
**[0:26:51-0:26:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:26:51):**  If that tank gets a little too low, their consumption goes through the roof.  Oh really?  I never knew that.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:26:59):**  He's got data, CK.  I never knew that.  That makes sense though.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:27:02):**  I would like to think it's a scarcity issue then.  So on like a 94 degree day, for example.  I've got these water meters now that are cell phone based.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:27:16):**  Every five seconds it sends a signal up.  And then the company holds onto that data for a day and then compiles it and gives it  to your computer.  
**[0:27:26-0:27:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:27:26):**  And so if you can keep that tank full at 94 degrees daily temperature, you can keep them  around 23, 24 gallons an animal, a unit, a thousand pound unit.  But then if you let it fall below that, they'll jump up to closer to 30 gallons.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:27:48):**  And when you're short of water anyways, you just can't.  And all it is is a psychology trick.  I was going to say a psychological factor, right?  
**[0:27:57-0:28:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:27:57):**  Yeah.  They're sensing shortage and filling themselves up to compensate.  Physiological response, right?  
**[0:28:04-0:28:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:28:04):**  Yeah.  And so it's, and if you're short of water anyways or restricted, that's just going to  compound problems because now you've added another five, six gallons unit, which is a  
**[0:28:20-0:28:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:28:20):**  lot.  Yeah.  You got 1500 of them.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:28:23):**  That's a lot.  You know what?  This reminds me of the panic toilet paper buying during COVID.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:28:29):**  That's what's happening.  Oh man.  Don't bring those days back.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:28:36):**  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  I am brand loyal.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:28:39):**  I'm brand loyal.  Yeah.  You want to give them a plug?  
**[0:28:47-0:28:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:28:47):**  Maybe you'll get sponsored.  Hit me with a stick.  But anyways, I live out in the country, right?  
**[0:28:52-0:29:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:28:52):**  So when you go to the grocery store, you got a carload.  Well Amazon.  Your house is like eight miles off the blacktop down the ranch roads.  
**[0:29:02-0:29:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:29:02):**  I know, but I hate going to town.  We all do.  Yes.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:29:06):**  So I order like toilet paper and you know, some canned goods through prime, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:29:16):**  Well, I ordered it in the big boxes and put it down in the basement.  Well I ordered a big box and then when my reminder come up, it was right in the middle  of that panic and you couldn't get toilet paper.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:29:29):**  And I was down on the end side of my inventory naturally.  And then when I did finally get some toilet paper, this old broad was looking at me cross-eyed.  I said, well, this is how much I usually buy at one time anyways.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:29:45):**  So just leave me alone.  I live 40 miles out in the country.  Yeah.  
**[0:29:50-0:29:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:29:50):**  Eating a lot of chili.  Leave me alone.  You're funny.  
**[0:29:53-0:30:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:29:53):**  You know that toilet paper.  Nice and chilly.  And you know, you put a roll down in the cubby hole to pick up and then it gets all chewed  
**[0:30:02-0:30:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:30:02):**  up and everything else.  So you know, you're wasting quite a bit.  So you got to get that out of the ring of oil and grease off of there before you use  
**[0:30:11-0:30:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:30:11):**  it.  I put mine in a gallon Ziploc bag and throw it in the center console.  I'm not that smart.  
**[0:30:18-0:30:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:30:18):**  Not that smart.  Every vehicle has a role in a Ziploc bag.  That's right.  
**[0:30:26-0:30:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:30:26):**  Somewhere.  Usually it's in the center console of my pickup or under the seat in the gator.  There you go.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:30:32):**  You got girls in your life.  You got toilet paper everywhere.  Or blue towels.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:30:37):**  The blue ones.  Those are good.  So yeah.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:30:44):**  How's things down in Kansas?  It's dry.  I think today is about 60 days since we've had much moisture.  
**[0:30:53-0:31:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:30:53):**  We've had two little snows, but they've been like dry powder an inch, maybe two inches  tops.  But you know, that's not even a 10th of an inch of rain.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:31:07):**  So it's dry.  It's been warm.  That's been nice.  
**[0:31:12-0:31:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:31:12):**  It was 65 today.  It's kind of a nice day to be out sorting cows and working cows.  Yeah.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:31:18):**  Did you get any of that high wind and fire next season?  We were in the middle of it.  Back in the middle of December.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:31:29):**  We had winds of over 75 miles an hour out at the ranch.  Weren't any fires close to us this time, but you know, there were fires southwest, west  and north.  
**[0:31:41-0:31:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:31:41):**  There's a pretty good size one up in northern Kansas, north central Kansas that burned.  At first they were saying like 400,000 acres, but they've dropped that all the way back  down to I think like 125,000.  
**[0:31:56-0:32:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:31:56):**  But it's just like, it was 80, the wind was 80 miles an hour when that fire was going  up there.  Yeah.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:32:04):**  No.  Run.  That's about it.  
**[0:32:08-0:32:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:32:08):**  Gortz, didn't you just have a fire happen on your grasses branch?  Did you?  Yeah, we had, oh geez, we had, well, we just had our fire department.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:32:20):**  I'm on the board of directors for our district.  So fire is pretty close to my heart.  So I'm like, that's why I'm that way.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:32:27):**  I'm not a fire bug or nothing.  I'm just on the board of directors, you know.  For like controlled burns or for emergency?  
**[0:32:35-0:32:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:32:35):**  Tell you what, in west South Dakota, we do not have anything called a controlled burn.  Oh really?  Okay.  
**[0:32:41-0:32:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:32:41):**  There's no such thing around here.  So you guys have no fire culture?  No, no, we, it is a political no-no on the, on the plains.  
**[0:32:53-0:33:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:32:53):**  It's the, the government entities have done, ruined that for the private guys.  So like the forestry management in California, probably equivalent.  So, so anyways, yeah, we had, we had an early fire.  
**[0:33:10-0:33:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:33:10):**  We've had really weird season fires.  Actually a couple of years ago, we had a fire the day before Thanksgiving come through and  burned up part of the ranch.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:33:18):**  It started by a railroad.  And then in the spring, we had some, some, uh, recreators out on the, on the forest service,  uh, public grounds, started fire one of those windy days and it ran, ran on to the ranch.  
**[0:33:33-0:33:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:33:33):**  It didn't do very much on us, but it did affect our neighbors pretty greatly.  I think, I think we burned up, I don't know, 160 acres or something like that.  So we just adjusted our grazing plan there and just gave it a little more rest and, and  
**[0:33:48-0:34:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:33:48):**  we had to cross three pastures to get back to it, back into the rotation.  So, so what changes in forage have you seen on that, on that little spot that was burned  by wildfire or have you noticed any changes in, in forage like composition or density?  
**[0:34:04-0:34:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:34:04):**  You want the God awful truth?  Yeah.  I haven't been there since we fixed the fence.  
**[0:34:12-0:34:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:34:12):**  Okay.  You've got 28,000 acres to worry about.  Cody was over there and he said, it looks good.  
**[0:34:22-0:34:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:34:22):**  So I'm going to take it for it.  So is it like biochar?  Like, I think that's the comment I always make.  
**[0:34:27-0:34:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:34:27):**  It's like, oh, burns are good.  It's like biochar.  So you just probably get really good succession.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:34:32):**  I think, I think it probably came back better than it was.  Cause it was, it was one of them corners that's, uh, away from water and kind of get them hard  to get them there and get them to utilize it.  
**[0:34:47-0:35:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:34:47):**  So we, we probably had too much litter, maybe a little oxidation in that area.  And then, you know, fire did, didn't hurt us at all going through there.  So I'll be over there now.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:35:00):**  Well, I'll, I'll now that you've called me on it, I'll make a follow up with us over  there.  I bet you next time they go through that pasture, they'll get it out of that corner.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:35:14):**  Yeah, yeah.  So, so yeah.  So yeah, I have not been over there.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:35:22):**  We, we, it was a part of the old, older fence.  It was a, probably a mid generation fence.  It was wood.  
**[0:35:30-0:35:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:35:30):**  And so we replaced the burnt H's and things like that and drove in steel.  So we won't have to worry about it again.  So that was the last time I was over there.  
**[0:35:40-0:35:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:35:40):**  That's how I feel about it.  Like if I got a wood post that burns out, I'm going to put a steel fence post back in  because if that steel post or that steel H brace burns out, I got way more problems than  
**[0:35:50-0:35:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:35:50):**  my fence burning up.  Yep.  Yep.  
**[0:35:53-0:36:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:35:53):**  So it's kind of nice.  There's spots.  There's a couple spots on the ranch, like where lightning had started a spot fire, you  
**[0:36:02-0:36:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:36:02):**  know, and it burned, you know, a couple hundred yards squared in a random circle, whatever.  I can go back to those even years later and see right where they are.  Really?  
**[0:36:16-0:36:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:36:16):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  Cause the cattle just use it just a little bit differently than everything around it.

**[0:36:35-0:36:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:36:35):**  Getting close to meaning it again, because I've got, I'm getting, you know, in pasture  corners and areas where cattle don't go very often, I'm getting a lot of old rank decadent  grass that's starting to oxidize and, and get that, that real ugly gray, black, you  
**[0:36:52-0:37:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:36:52):**  know, gray, black colors in the, in the understory.  So time to put some fire on that.  For pigs.  
**[0:37:02-0:37:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:37:02):**  Oh, pigs in the Hills are a sore subject, Mr. Espy.  Oh, okay.  Well, it's a political non-starter.  
**[0:37:13-0:37:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:37:13):**  Yeah.  Kind of like us doing intentional control birds on the ranch.  Yeah.  
**[0:37:21-0:37:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:37:21):**  Same thing.  So I, I don't know when it was.  It's probably around, it was around 20 years ago.  
**[0:37:28-0:37:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:37:28):**  I'm not for sure.  I was in the Navy.  Somehow some pigs got into the area and went feral.  
**[0:37:38-0:37:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:37:38):**  And anybody that's from Texas or Oklahoma knows what happens when that happens.  They multiply rapidly.  You can hunt them in Texas.  
**[0:37:51-0:37:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:37:51):**  You can hunt them in Oklahoma.  That's great.  Kansas said, we're not going to let you hunt them unless they're on your land destroying  
**[0:37:57-0:38:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:37:57):**  stuff.  And if you're going to do it in four minutes for hogs, we're going to kill them.  So KDHE, no, or is it animal health, whatever the Kansas animal health agency is.  
**[0:38:09-0:38:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:38:09):**  I forget what it is off the top of my head.  Got with USDA wildlife services, came up with a bunch of money to start trapping and shooting  these hogs.  
**[0:38:21-0:38:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:38:21):**  And over four years, they flew the helicopter here in Barbara County.  The first, second, third years, they got a whole bunch, like hundreds in a day or two.  And then the last year, I think they flew for three days and got 21 hogs.  
**[0:38:41-0:38:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:38:41):**  And then after that, they've been like, it's just been monitoring and occasionally trapping  a trapping one that they find out loose.  We think we might have got them almost exterminated in the area.  
**[0:38:55-0:39:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:38:55):**  So yeah, we don't want to talk about letting hogs run around uncontained.  Well the reason I said pigs is, you remember when the COVID first hit and they shut down  the pig plant in Sioux Falls.  
**[0:39:11-0:39:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:39:11):**  I think they do 5,000 head in a day or whatever they do there.  I don't know how many thousand head dogs they did, but there was a glut of hogs in South  Dakota and you could get them for next to nothing.  
**[0:39:24-0:39:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:39:24):**  I mean, bout the freight was all it was.  And so Justin was a farmer, reformed pig farmer from Indiana.  He worked on a farm that had pigs.  
**[0:39:37-0:39:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:39:37):**  He was more of a, Justin's from Indiana, but he had experience with pigs.  We won't hold that against him.  No, no.  
**[0:39:46-0:40:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:39:46):**  And then I had four H pigs when I was eight.  And so we decided to, we went and got 12 pigs and we turned them loose in Justin's yard  and we had some electric fence for sheep.  
**[0:40:01-0:40:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:40:01):**  Some of them, that netting from Callaway or Gallagher.  Gallagher.  Gallagher.  
**[0:40:10-0:40:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:40:10):**  Yeah.  Gallagher.  They can't get through it really easily.  
**[0:40:13-0:40:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:40:13):**  Right.  Yeah.  So we set that up and we converted the old welding trailer into a water trailer and we  
**[0:40:21-0:40:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:40:21):**  had 12 pigs going around Justin's yard in a 40 by 40 square.  And he was moving them like every two or three days.  And then we had the pigs in there for the summer.  
**[0:40:35-0:40:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:40:35):**  And then they turned into bacon miraculously and sausage and pork chops.  We let it rest all winter, let it rest most of the spring.  And then we turned the Buffalo in there and you wouldn't believe, you know, what kind  
**[0:40:51-0:41:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:40:51):**  of action you got where they were just, and you know, some of it might've been the water.  And then, you know, we were able to concentrate that all that biomass right there and it just  gorgeous, you know?  
**[0:41:06-0:41:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:41:06):**  So it's funny what you can do with gardening of animals and disturbing that soil, making  it look like crap for a couple of days and then giving it enough recovery and rest and  letting it come back.  
**[0:41:23-0:41:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:41:23):**  So outside the box, we're not going to do it because boy, it's labor intensive.  And then they're so cute when they're little and then they're just so mean when they're  big and we're not set up to load them onto the horse trailer or nothing.  
**[0:41:41-0:41:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:41:41):**  And they've got way more, we let them go way too long.  I think mine was 400 and some pounds by the time we got butchers.  Oh, geez.  
**[0:41:49-0:41:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:41:49):**  You know, was the bacon good though?  Oh, it was good.  But you know what it's like holding a piece of plywood, trying to get them onto a trailer.  
**[0:41:59-0:42:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:41:59):**  They make the ugliest sounds.  In the middle of a thousand acre pasture, you know, like a, oh, geez.  So yeah, no way.  
**[0:42:15-0:42:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:42:15):**  No way.  I don't know if I'd do it again.  But it would have to be hundreds and hundreds and then you'd have to hire some guys, make  
**[0:42:22-0:42:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:42:22):**  a true enterprise out of it.  But it was a fun little experiment.  And you know, those pigs only had one bad day in their life.  
**[0:42:31-0:42:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:42:31):**  And that was it.  So scale, is this something that people don't always can't always wrap their heads around?  Oh, we'll just get some pigs or just get some chickens like 7000 acres here.  
**[0:42:43-0:42:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:42:43):**  Do you understand how big that is?  And how many pigs I would have to have to actually make a difference to do it?  Yeah, I know.  
**[0:42:52-0:43:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:42:52):**  Just get some goats like, okay, I'll just go get 500 goats.  Yeah, that'll work.  I want to go and a herder.  
**[0:43:00-0:43:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:43:00):**  Yeah, and a camper and and and and a couple of dogs.  Sounds like suspiciously like a black hat coming out there.  Yeah, it does.  
**[0:43:12-0:43:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:43:12):**  But you know, goats, goats are where it's at.  You know, I think the sheep and goat guys are making more money than we are.  Yeah.  
**[0:43:21-0:43:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:43:21):**  Yeah.  On a per unit basis.  It's just insane.  
**[0:43:25-0:43:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:43:25):**  And then if, if you can get the direct marketing down and get in the right market area, you've  got to make, you know, so  Yes, you can direct sell sheep and goats to some ethnic groups, and they will drive out  
**[0:43:39-0:43:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:43:39):**  to your pasture and butcher it themselves or take it home live.  Like  Yeah, well,  
**[0:43:49-0:43:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:43:49):**  we're gonna be getting into that probably, hopefully this year and coming episodes talking  to some sheep and goat guys and learning their secrets.  Nice.  
**[0:43:58-0:44:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:43:58):**  If they'll tell us,  they'll tell us I want to get there's one guy who talked about, oh, he probably will  come on actually, now that I'm thinking about it.  
**[0:44:05-0:44:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:44:05):**  He used to go to the black market in Chicago underground, underground subway and sell a  load of sheep for cash.  I'm not getting  
**[0:44:16-0:44:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:44:16):**  you would just sell them live to the ethnic market in frickin Chicago.  Crazy.  And they probably only had one bad day in their whole life.  
**[0:44:30-0:44:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:44:30):**  So I want to hear now I want to hear some of the story of Moritz.  Where did Moritz come from?  And how did he get to be the manager of the triple seven?  
**[0:44:38-0:44:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:44:38):**  Oh, 100% completely by accident.  That's ways those things happen, though.  Yeah, failed upwards.  
**[0:44:49-0:44:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:44:49):**  I was gonna backtrack, I was gonna try to find it my screen for my zoom, but I think  that's on a different one.  I have a big sign that has a goat with a no goats on it.  
**[0:44:59-0:45:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:44:59):**  And that's what I use for my el board zoom calls.  But I was my family's background, whole extended family has touched agriculture somehow.  My folks are from southeastern Montana, my grand folks.  
**[0:45:22-0:45:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:45:22):**  One side's been there for over 100 years and the other side's been there for almost 100.  And everybody's either in agriculture or least not too far removed.  And my mom and dad's place was big enough to raise a family but not really have two  
**[0:45:43-0:45:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:45:43):**  families working on it.  They currently lease it out and provide them a pretty good life.  I went to school in Rapid City, South Dakota on a scholarship.  
**[0:45:56-0:46:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:45:56):**  And I started doing some day labor work at 777 Ranch in college for some extra money.  And then I graduated school, I went to work for the FSA for a little bit.  And then I went to US Bank Systems as an ag lender, and I got my three and a half years  
**[0:46:19-0:46:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:46:19):**  experience in there.  And I was always sitting in there looking out the window, and I liked what I do.  I liked the customers that I had.  
**[0:46:30-0:46:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:46:30):**  And this was during mad cow times, so things weren't all that great.  But I enjoyed what I did and I enjoyed helping people.  And actually, now 20 years later, I was at a funeral back home and met my very first  
**[0:46:49-0:46:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:46:49):** ... I didn't meet him.  I saw him and had a good visit with him.  My very first customer as an ag lender.  
**[0:46:59-0:47:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:46:59):**  And when you're an ag lender, all the other people above you clean their files out of  their junk and they're losers, and they give them to you.  And that was the first file that I opened.  
**[0:47:11-0:47:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:47:11):**  And I met him and I went to bat for him in the back room of the conference room with  the loan committee, and he wanted to make some drastic changes.  And this was in 2000, early 2000s, and it was going against tradition.  
**[0:47:31-0:47:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:47:31):**  And I saw the numbers and thought it could work.  And I went to bat for him and 20 years later, he's added property, he's raised a family,  he's bringing kids back to the ranch.  
**[0:47:44-0:47:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:47:44):**  And that's the story that I want to take away from ag lending.  I don't want to take away any of those other stories.  That's the story that I want to focus on.  
**[0:47:54-0:48:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:47:54):**  And then Mimi was taking over ownership and management of the ranch, and she needed somebody  to come work for her.  And I was actually down there doing some day labor and working on a commercial on my vacation  
**[0:48:08-0:48:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:48:08):**  days at the bank.  And I said, Mimi, if you ever got a job opening here, give me a call.  I might come down and help you out.  
**[0:48:20-0:48:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:48:20):**  And so she called that bluff and I was like, you know, I'm going to do it.  And there ain't nothing worse than telling your dad, who's been a rancher all his life,  and you say, dad, I'm going to quit the bank, not going to wear a tie anymore, and I'm going  
**[0:48:41-0:49:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:48:41):**  to get rid of my stable job and my 401k and I'm going to go work for a ranch behind man.  Did he disown you or threatened to?  You know, he was, you could kind of see that, you know, he was, I think he was more shocked  
**[0:49:00-0:49:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:49:00):**  than anything, but you know, he was supportive.  He says, well, you got to go do it.  You know, I was in my mid twenties.  
**[0:49:07-0:49:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:49:07):**  What did I have to lose?  I mean, if it didn't work out, I'm sure he probably would have opened up the couch and  laid on the heavy glares and a few told you so's, and then I probably could have got back  
**[0:49:21-0:49:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:49:21):**  on my feet and did something else.  But, you know, I had my resume built.  I could, I could always just go work for Wells Fargo or somebody else at that time.  
**[0:49:30-0:49:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:49:30):**  You know, so, you know, I mean, there was a way out.  It was just, but I don't think anybody thought it was going to stick.  And by God, it stuck because once you drink the Kool-Aid out of the, you know, you, you,  
**[0:49:43-0:49:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:49:43):**  you finally finish Alice Avery's book and then, you know, you get through that and then  you, then you're chasing Buffalo.  I mean, you're in, you're in, there's no turnaround.  
**[0:49:52-0:50:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:49:52):**  So I think what also helps you made the comment already is you have an amazing boss.  And I think that is something that's very crucial is it sounds like she's been pretty  crucial to you staying on, right?  
**[0:50:07-0:50:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:50:07):**  Yeah, we've, we've, we've developed a relationship over, over the years because, you know, people  that know me personally, you know, I was, I like to have a good time and drive fast.  I don't know what else to put it, but you know, fast horses and, and walk slowly and  
**[0:50:27-0:50:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:50:27):**  yeah, that's what I like to do.  And, and, you know, she let me grow, let me make some mistakes.  Let me fail forward.

So we've made mistakes on the ranch, but you know, we were, we were we were feeding a hundred  
**[0:50:53-0:51:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:50:53):**  percent.  Well, not a hundred percent.  We were feeding close to probably 75, 80% of our calf crop in the corrals on a, on a  
**[0:51:02-0:51:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:51:02):**  feed ration and taking them clear to slaughter.  And so we were carrying overheads there and then we were feeding hay and cake to the herd  and we were running pretty close to 2,800 head, maybe close to 3000 head.  
**[0:51:19-0:51:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:51:19):**  And yeah, those were big numbers and they were fun to, fun to put up.  But it was a lot of work.  It was, it was feeding animals in the corrals every day, you know, truckload leaving about  
**[0:51:30-0:51:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:51:30):**  every week.  You know, just too many.  Was that too many bison for the ranch?  
**[0:51:39-0:51:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:51:39):**  Not with, not with supplemental feed.  That's that's where, that's why we're feeding so much hay and cake.  So you know, we were, we were, we had them on feed, you know, for five and a half months.  
**[0:51:53-0:52:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:51:53):**  So you know, the 20th October, you just started filling the feed wagon with ground hay and  cake going out and feeding every day.  And  
**[0:52:06-0:52:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:52:06):**  You're not doing that anymore, are you?  No, no.  So so yeah, now we're, now we're down to, you know, about 1500.  
**[0:52:16-0:52:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:52:16):**  You know, when it was wet a couple years ago, I think we were up to 1800, 1900 animal units.  You know, like 2400 head, but 1800 units.  But you know, now we we feed less.  
**[0:52:33-0:52:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:52:33):**  We we finish on grass, we're AGA certified and GAP certified.  So that's, that's the way we're going.  So we decreased our overheads, you know, crazy amounts, crazy amounts, and then shorten our  
**[0:52:50-0:53:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:52:50):**  cash flow down to less than a year by going from holding them and feeding them to slaughter,  to selling calves.  And then we did that for several years.  
**[0:53:02-0:53:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:53:02):**  And now we're ratcheting back up into  holding yearlings and then run them as two year olds.  And so, you know, we went from a 24 to 36 month cash flow down to a year cash flow.  
**[0:53:18-0:53:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:53:18):**  Now we're ratcheting it back up to 1824 month cash flow, but slowly and doing it on grass  without adding overheads.  So that's where we're, that's what we're trying to do there.  
**[0:53:32-0:53:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:53:32):**  You know, you there's a lot of volatility on the calf side.  But there's some stability on the on the on the grass fed side, on the finish side, grass  finished and, and we're trying to grow that grass finish because, you know, bison have  
**[0:53:47-0:53:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:53:47):**  this halo.  And to my fellow bison producers, I'm not trying to kick any dirt or dry lines in the  stand.  
**[0:53:54-0:54:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:53:54):**  We're we're in this together.  We're all about protein and we're all about species.  But the consumer's eyes, there's a there's a halo on these on these animals head.  
**[0:54:05-0:54:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:54:05):**  And the basic assumption is that it is bison and it is grass fed.  And that is not the case.  And we're trying to, we're trying to make ourselves a smaller niche inside of a niche  
**[0:54:17-0:54:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:54:17):**  and say that we are a GAP certified product and an AGA certified product, third party  verified grass fed animal from your door, from our pasture to your door.  So that's where we're going.  
**[0:54:34-0:54:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:54:34):**  Rejatively graced.  I like it.  Yeah.  
**[0:54:38-0:54:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:54:38):**  So and we're making steps and I think next year, I think next year on Shawn's packages,  there'll be a QR code and you'll be able to scan that QR code.  You'll be able to, to see which animal that was.  
**[0:54:54-0:55:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:54:54):**  And if you want to dig a little deeper, we've got the software set up and the traceability  program set up and running now that you'll be able to scan that QR code and then you  can see every time we move that animal from one pasture to another when it left the ranch  
**[0:55:09-0:55:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:55:09):**  when it arrived and when it was killed when it was boxed, everything else.  So  Hey, I got to know more about that.  
**[0:55:17-0:55:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:55:17):**  It's kind of hard to talk about traceability like that with a lot of cow guys, because  a lot of cow guys are frankly afraid of it.  I'm not.  
**[0:55:26-0:55:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:55:26):**  So I want to hear some more about that system.  Like what's it called?  And, and  
**[0:55:30-0:55:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:55:30):**  Well, right now in the management system, well, what's it called?  It's called the EID tags.  Okay.  
**[0:55:39-0:55:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:55:39):**  How are you tracking it with your software?  So we're using Agri web right now.  And then Sean's working with a developer to, to take that information from Agri web and  
**[0:55:52-0:56:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:55:52):**  then correlate it over to the QR code.  Okay.  So that's where we're at now.  
**[0:56:00-0:56:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:56:00):**  It's, we're not even into beta yet.  So that's, that's where we're at.  But hopefully by next year, it'll work.  
**[0:56:09-0:56:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:56:09):**  So  I'm at got a good, solid concept and you think you know how it should work?  Yeah.  
**[0:56:15-0:56:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:56:15):**  But, but no, you know, 95% of us there through Agri web.  Okay.  We're using it.  
**[0:56:21-0:56:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:56:21):**  They're out of they're out of Australia.  And then they they're in the United States now they're a group of young guys.  They're really good.  
**[0:56:31-0:56:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:56:31):**  We did use Maya as a grazing app.  And you know, we use Pasture Map.  Actually I'm still using Pasture Map.  
**[0:56:39-0:56:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:56:39):**  I like Maya.  Maya was good for analytics, but yeah, there's a whole farm program and really didn't fit.  So we gave Agri web a try and that's where we're at now.  
**[0:56:50-0:57:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:56:50):**  And you know, they record every time we put out mineral, every time we, you know, move  animals, anything that's done tagging, you can do scoring.  You know, like if one's got a bad foot, you can flag it and everything else and record  
**[0:57:09-0:57:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:57:09):**  all that.  So, and then primarily that was for our GAP certification for our third party certifications.  So you know, because they're going to be tougher and tougher every year and AGA is going to  
**[0:57:21-0:57:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:57:21):**  be tougher and tougher.  You know, we're autobond also, but autobond is pretty easy.  So that was pretty much for the third party verification to verify that, you know, they  
**[0:57:32-0:57:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:57:32):**  are on pasture.  They're not in the corrals for 40, 45 days.  So I can, so it's, it's real live time, live information that's, that's printable in a  
**[0:57:47-0:58:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:57:47):**  easily digestible form for your auditors.  You know, and like you said, it's a tough conversation for the cattle guys because the  cow guys, like right now we can demand a little bit of premium for that.  
**[0:58:03-0:58:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:58:03):**  And this whole deal of RFIDs, you know, I got to pay the cost.  You've got to pay the cost, but you're not getting any premium.  So now, now our overheads are, are, well, our direct cost per head has gone up, you  
**[0:58:19-0:58:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:58:19):**  know, you know, cause we've got to buy the readers.  We've got to pay for the software.  We've got to buy the, you know, the iPads and you know, like my neighbor that came over  
**[0:58:31-0:58:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:58:31):**  to help me, he was kind of, he was kind of chuckling.  We were doing a sort on a miscellaneous pen and we had about six different animals in  this pen and we were rescanning them.  
**[0:58:42-0:58:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:58:42):**  And I had the iPad, my left hand and a stylist in my mouth for my iPad.  And I was running the hydraulic chute with the other, had my scanner, the boss had the  scanner and she was scanning them in the, in the ready chute behind the squeeze chute.  
**[0:58:58-0:59:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:58:58):**  I was running the hydraulic sword out the front and he thought that was pretty funny  that, you know, you got that iPad.  He says, if the phone would've rang, it really would have been a really good picture to take.  
**[0:59:09-0:59:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:59:09):**  I would have been talking on the phone at the same time.  But, you know, that's where it's coming from because everybody, you know, it's, it's, it's  that one half of 1% that ruins it for everybody else.  
**[0:59:25-0:59:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:59:25):**  This guy that says, yep, you know, we're all this or, you know, what do you call it?  Greenwashing or whatever, you know, whatever those companies are doing that are making  it tough, you know, cause it used to be, Oh yeah, you know, come out and, you know, we're  
**[0:59:42-0:59:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:59:42):**  trying to be as transparent as we can be.  You know, we host several groups and tourists and things like that have visitors.  We've got nothing to hide, but the average consumer can't, you know, just load up and  
**[0:59:55-1:00:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=0:59:55):**  come to South Dakota and verify.  So we've got to develop that trust, trust some other way, because it's just not a affidavit.  It's just not a signature.  
**[1:00:07-1:00:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:00:07):**  Oh yeah, I've owned these animals their whole life and they've been on grass.  They've never had any, any animal byproducts and things like that.  And, you know, well, like lanolin is lanolin an animal byproduct.  
**[1:00:30-1:00:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:00:30):**  I'd probably say yeah, because it comes from wool.  Right.  You know, in my mind it's not, but if somebody found out that it comes from wool, did that,  
**[1:00:43-1:00:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:00:43):**  did that sheep have to die to get that lanolin or was it dead after, you know, so I mean,  it's a gray area.  So like, you know, I don't know, check with your vitamin D like you're in your mineral  
**[1:00:56-1:01:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:00:56):**  pro regime.  Most of your vitamin D is sourced out of, out of, from lanolin.  Really?  
**[1:01:03-1:01:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:01:03):**  Well, that like similar to tallow then?  Similar, but you know, lanolin comes from the oils in the wool.  Yeah.  
**[1:01:11-1:01:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:01:11):**  The fat after they've been butchered.  So but, so, but if you, if you just imagine yourself as somebody in the downtown, whatever  urban metropolis, and you're like, well, what is lanolin?  
**[1:01:27-1:01:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:01:27):**  Well, lanolin is oil off of a sheep, you know, from their wool.  So, like even our vitamin D, we pay extra to get the medical grade human stuff for vitamin  D, instead of just getting it from lanolin.  
**[1:01:40-1:01:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:01:40):**  So that's, that's how deep we're going.  So you know, that's, that's where we're trying to be.  And you know, and then non-GMO, you know, God, everywhere I go, there's a fucking GMO  
**[1:01:52-1:02:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:01:52):**  standing around the corner gonna get me and you know, but you know, we don't feed, we  don't feed our animals any GMOs, you know, and, you know, it's just, it's just like,  like sea salt.  
**[1:02:08-1:02:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:02:08):**  Yeah.  And alfalfa.  Yeah.  
**[1:02:12-1:02:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:02:12):**  Like and only only just a little bit alfalfa to get them through the winter because my  forage is just it's protein deficient.  Right.  
**[1:02:20-1:02:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:02:20):**  I use C90 sea salt.  And they quit eating everything else.  They quit eating the mineral blocks that we had out.  
**[1:02:28-1:02:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:02:28):**  Yeah.  No, it's, do bison, how do you supplement a bison?  Like do they need a lot different of a mineral package than a cow?  
**[1:02:37-1:02:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:02:37):**  Or is it pretty similar?  There's no significant data research that knows what the true nutritional intake for  bison is.  
**[1:02:51-1:03:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:02:51):**  Good answer.  So you just got to go off your historical calving rates and how good they look.  They look like crap.  
**[1:03:02-1:03:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:03:02):**  They got a dull look to them.  They're probably something missing.  And so we based we built, we built our mineral program off of cattle data, tweaked it from  
**[1:03:16-1:03:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:03:16):**  there.  The hard part about mineral supplementation for bison is getting them to eat it.  And there's camps of people that have just the bare trace mineral buffets out there.  
**[1:03:29-1:03:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:03:29):**  Redmond, tell you what there's Redmond is a big player, Payback and Purina.  Okay.  Yeah.  
**[1:03:39-1:03:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:03:39):**  Do they have injectables for bison or no?  There is no labeled use for any pharmaceuticals for bison because any time you use anything  for bison, it's off label.  
**[1:03:53-1:03:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:03:53):**  So,  Oh wow.  I didn't know that either.  
**[1:03:56-1:04:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:03:56):**  But I am a big proponent of multi-min.  I really enjoy multi-min and I think it really makes a difference, especially on them baby  calves.  
**[1:04:06-1:04:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:04:06):**  So, but yeah, I feel like that's a missed opportunity more it's for them not to label  it for bison use.  Well the amount of sales that's going to go into the bison and then, you know, it has  
**[1:04:20-1:04:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:04:20):**  to be studied.  They don't think it's significant enough.  Is that what it is?  
**[1:04:24-1:04:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:04:24):**  That's crazy.  Half a million head of bison, like that wouldn't pay for this.  I don't know.  
**[1:04:29-1:04:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:04:29):**  That's so pretty effed up.  Like, yeah, just put it on there so we can do it.  But you know, you know, I mean, you go to the USDA and they got, they got, you know,  
**[1:04:39-1:04:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:04:39):**  nutritional requirements for EMUs.  And everything else, but there just hasn't been enough done on bison.  So yeah, but we'll get there.  
**[1:04:52-1:05:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:04:52):**  That's what part of the center of excellence at the SDSU Brookings is all about is to get  that kind of going.  And so we have a, we have a chair, I think that's what it's called a chair, university  
**[1:05:06-1:05:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:05:06):**  chair or something.  And so we've got two people working on programs and grants and correlating data from studies  from way back when.  
**[1:05:21-1:05:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:05:21):**  And then they're even, you know, they're even collecting, you know, rancher data and things  like that.  So now all that data is going to be collected in one spot, cataloged and hopefully put to  
**[1:05:32-1:05:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:05:32):**  use for the producers.  So that just got going here about two years ago.  So we're moving up in the world.  
**[1:05:41-1:05:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:05:41):**  Yeah, that'll be interesting.  It's surprising to me that there's no university data on veterinary practices for bison or  there's not much for veterinary practices on bison.  
**[1:05:53-1:06:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:05:53):**  And there's like almost none on like medication and supplementation.  There is a handful, you know, turners.  Turners have been doing some research on their stuff and then back, back in the 90s and early  
**[1:06:09-1:06:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:06:09):**  2000s, Wendell, Eden, NDSU, can't remember the doctor's name right now.  But it was the bison research was at NDSU in North Dakota.  So and then that quit.  
**[1:06:26-1:06:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:06:26):**  So there's there's a little bit of data, you know, as far as digestibility and then, oh,  cripes, I just went blank.  Skinny guy, gray hair, salt and pepper, University of Saskatchewan.  
**[1:06:45-1:06:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:06:45):**  The Canadians, Canadians are ahead of us, though.  They've got a lot of data.  And they did, they've used some government funding just to have ranchers just collect  
**[1:06:58-1:07:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:06:58):**  necropsy samples, just send them in.  You know, they paid them to do that.  So you know, so Canada's got some, some research.  
**[1:07:08-1:07:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:07:08):**  So you know, there's, there's there, there is research out there.  But like, as far as pharmaceuticals go, there's, you know, there's no real data.  So what do you do when you have one that gets sick or is is obviously ill and in distress?  
**[1:07:24-1:07:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:07:24):**  No, don't panic.  Well, if they do get sick, you got something wrong.  That's one good thing.  
**[1:07:37-1:07:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:07:37):**  Like, yeah, if it's not trauma related, you're gonna have some problems because they're pretty  healthy for the most part.  But you're saying like, it's not going to be just one?  
**[1:07:49-1:08:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:07:49):**  Yeah, it's not gonna be it's Lay's potato chip time, you might as well just you just  might as well clear your calendar because you got problems.  Mycoplasma has reared its head this year, pretty dang hard.  
**[1:08:03-1:08:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:08:03):**  It hit us.  Cattle, it's not a big deal.  You hit them with a little bit of Draxin and they come right out of it cleans it right  
**[1:08:11-1:08:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:08:11):**  up.  They get a runny nose, a little bit of cough.  They might lose 20-30 pounds, but it kills bison dead or in a darn hell.  
**[1:08:19-1:08:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:08:19):**  So if you get mycoplasma and your bison hurt, you're expecting probably five to 30% death  loss.  What does that do?  
**[1:08:27-1:08:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:08:27):**  It doesn't restrict?  Is it restricts oxygen to the to like organs or?  It's kind of like a pneumonia.  
**[1:08:38-1:08:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:08:38):**  It turns respiratory then lungs look like their liver.  It slowly closes up and then like they've been getting there's several strains that  are swelling the lymph nodes and restricting airflow and food consumption and that you  
**[1:08:53-1:09:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:08:53):**  get arthritis symptoms and then you get a mastitis symptoms and then usually a bad bag.  So yeah, it's got instant effects and then lingering effects.  And so, you know, the industry, Turner's and several other producers, including ourselves,  
**[1:09:15-1:09:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:09:15):**  we all got together and cultured some mycoplasma years ago and did a private label vaccine  through Newport Labs.  And then another group of two producers actually did their own and a separate same but separate  
**[1:09:31-1:09:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:09:31):**  kind of vaccine.  And that seemed to be working for a while and, you know, now we're into Omnicron or  the mycoplasma and the bison.  
**[1:09:42-1:10:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:09:42):**  It's mutated again and that strain that we've been culturing that several producers have  been culturing wasn't included in the vaccine, but it will be, you know, in the next one,  but that doesn't help you for 12 to 18 months.  
**[1:10:00-1:10:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:10:00):**  But it takes the integrity and the wherewithal and the community mindedness of each producer  to go out and actually take the samples and then get those extra samples to the lab to  be cultured and mapped.  
**[1:10:19-1:10:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:10:19):**  So that's, you know, another hell, another 180 bucks or something like that per animal.  So you as a producer, you know, you can't rely on Zoidyce or Fort Dodge to be already  handling this for you.  
**[1:10:33-1:10:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:10:33):**  You've got to be the one being proactive and doing it.  So but, you know, that thank God that, you know, we're all family and if I'm getting  it, somebody's going to get it later.  
**[1:10:44-1:11:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:10:44):**  And so if I can get my sample in, you know, a month sooner, you know, that means the vaccine  will be done a month sooner for somebody else.  So it's good that you guys stick together like that.  
**[1:11:00-1:11:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:11:00):**  And then, you know, so we had mycoplasma and we didn't sell an animal off the place live  this year.  Because of the mycoplasma just you know, well, make sure it didn't leave.  
**[1:11:12-1:11:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:11:12):**  Well, yeah, well, the samples we were culturing were not included in the original vaccine.  And so that means that nobody else there's only two vaccines being made.  And there's one company making both vaccines.  
**[1:11:26-1:11:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:11:26):**  And we're talking to them on the phone.  They say, well, it's not included in the in the in the, you know, the vaccine.  So you know, we just we decided we changed our management.  
**[1:11:38-1:11:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:11:38):**  And the only thing that we sold were were animals destined for slaughter.  So you know, not everyone can do that.  And did I do it, you know, on?  
**[1:11:50-1:12:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:11:50):**  Well, you know, I did it, but do I enjoy it?  No, I carried over a few animals and I, my gross product went down and my cash income  went down.  
**[1:12:03-1:12:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:12:03):**  So you know, so hopefully next year, by the time we get the handle on everything, and  I'm not showing any symptoms and have any, you know, big, big positives, well, then I'll  be able to, in good conscious be able to move some animals down the road.  
**[1:12:18-1:12:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:12:18):**  So I hope that works out for you.  Yeah, but, you know, I don't want to be the one let's cat out of the bag, you know, so  that's that's where we're at.  
**[1:12:30-1:12:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:12:30):**  So but I don't think everybody would do that.  But I'm pretty sure about 98% of the bison or 99% of the bison producers that I hang  out with would do that.  
**[1:12:43-1:12:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:12:43):**  So you just change the management.  But you know, that comes from back to holistic management, you know, because we're used to  changing, you know, it gets dry, you know, we got to be stuck, you know, gets wet, oh,  
**[1:12:54-1:13:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:12:54):**  we got to we got to move a little faster, you know, and, you know, you're just you're  just used to changing your plans, and you're just not stuck in your ways.  So it makes it a little easier.  
**[1:13:06-1:13:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:13:06):**  But on the pocketbook, you just it's ag, roll it over.  We'll do better next year.  We'll do better next year.  
**[1:13:17-1:13:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:13:17):**  Oh, I don't.  I remember when I was growing up when you and I were both much younger men, that there  was a lot of controversy about bison, and that most of the bison had cattle DNA in them.  
**[1:13:35-1:13:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:13:35):**  What can you say about bison and the purity of their DNA?  Did I open up a can of worms for you?  Well, my my personal stance, more test be representing triple seven ranch.  
**[1:13:58-1:14:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:13:58):**  We do DNA test all of our animals.  We were in the very first of the bunch to do our DNA testing with Texas and and we were  we were donating and sending we were participating and donating to get the genome mapped.  
**[1:14:19-1:14:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:14:19):**  And so we do not allow anything to continue breeding that has cattle in aggression.  But we are not selecting for that.  We're not.  
**[1:14:38-1:14:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:14:38):**  I don't know how to say it.  I'll just say it in easy terms.  The base cow herd there was cows with cattle in aggression.  
**[1:14:45-1:14:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:14:45):**  Okay, we did not focus on those animals and take them out of the herd and kill them.  We are letting them finish their productive life.  If they become open, they're going to be cold anyways.  
**[1:14:59-1:15:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:14:59):**  But then our replacement heifers we've been doing DNA testing to current technology.  And if that year's heifers meet current technology to go back into the herd as testing free of  cattle alleles, they go back into the herd.  
**[1:15:15-1:15:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:15:15):**  What percentage of bison will test free from cattle alleles?  In our herd?  In your herd and in the North American bison herd?  
**[1:15:27-1:15:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:15:27):**  A lot.  I think we did 230 heifers and we had two tests.  Two of them test with cattle alleles.  
**[1:15:46-1:15:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:15:46):**  Less than a percent for you guys.  What's it like in the rest of the industry though?  I don't think it's that high.  
**[1:15:57-1:16:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:15:57):**  And then you know there for a while, they couldn't tell the difference between prehistoric  cattle and modern cattle.  So they didn't know if it was cattle before the ice age or cattle when the Europeans showed  
**[1:16:09-1:16:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:16:09):**  up.  But the technology is getting better.  The samples, because you got to remember you're dealing with bison, your data set is about  
**[1:16:19-1:16:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:16:19):**  this big.  So until the data set, you know, like if you think about Angus, the data set is huge.  And then if you deal with bison, the data set is like that.  
**[1:16:32-1:16:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:16:32):**  So it's controversial.  And if somebody, here's the problem.  If somebody is using cattle DNA or cattle inaggression as an argument, okay, that's  
**[1:16:48-1:17:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:16:48):**  outside of their management plan, they're using it as a tool to fool you.  Because they've got something up their sleeve.  Now if your management plan is to maintain the integrity of bison, bison as a species  
**[1:17:06-1:17:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:17:06):**  without cattle inaggression, and we're going to cull animals that happen to test, you know,  but if you're going to go out and just forcibly cull animals that test and not, you know,  they did that, you know, we went to World War Two for people, you know, doing stuff  
**[1:17:24-1:17:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:17:24):**  for genetics and culling them hard.  So won't even go down that road with animals.  So if it's part of your management plan, and you're going to work it out, yeah, that's  
**[1:17:32-1:17:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:17:32):**  fine.  But then take a step back.  And what I want you to remember is, is let's teleport back to 1890, right?  
**[1:17:44-1:18:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:17:44):**  And supposedly, there's, you know, 1000 head of bison in the whole world, or less.  And me and you are standing next to Charles Goodnight or Scotty Phillip or Lone Coyote  of Montana or, you know, whoever, right?  
**[1:18:03-1:18:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:18:03):**  We're standing right next to some of those conservationists of the bison.  Last of the original native plains bison.  Right.  
**[1:18:14-1:18:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:18:14):**  What are the tools at our disposal?  Eyeballs.  Eyeballs, and things that we know.  
**[1:18:21-1:18:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:18:21):**  And those guys tried to cross breed some cattle into bison, and were successful in a little  bit of them and made some beefalo and some of them beefalo were able to breed and had  more, right?  
**[1:18:36-1:18:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:18:36):**  So, sterile, you know.  So anyways, you know, it's you're cussing these guys for trying to do the best they  could with what they had.  
**[1:18:49-1:19:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:18:49):**  And I think the argument is, if they had not had tried to cross breed them with cattle,  that they would have, that bison bison would have been extinct.  Maybe.  
**[1:19:00-1:19:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:19:00):**  I don't know, I ain't gonna argue it.  It's possible.  Totally possible.  
**[1:19:08-1:19:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:19:08):**  But here's my side.  We've got cattle inagression going clear to 1890 or 1900, right?  And so now we have a line of generation, post bottleneck, that has made it to 2020.  
**[1:19:27-1:19:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:19:27):**  So what did that animal contribute to the genetic gene pool to get here?  Right.  And probably could be 20 to 30 generations ago.  
**[1:19:39-1:19:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:19:39):**  Right.  Like I am as much Chinese as my, the buffalo standing on Triple Seven Ranch, those few  head that have cattle in aggression are cattle.  
**[1:19:54-1:20:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:19:54):**  And you know, so and you know, we do not promote cross breeding of bison with cattle.  We don't do that.  We try to preserve the integrity of the species, bison and bison at the ranch.  
**[1:20:07-1:20:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:20:07):**  But all I'm saying is, is that cow, that lineage of animal made it whether it was a longhorn  in Texas that escaped from the conquistadors, or if it was a local farmer that caught a  calf and cross bred it with his milk cow, whatever it was.  
**[1:20:27-1:20:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:20:27):**  It wasn't in recent history, like the 90s or the 80s, or even the 60s, which these people  are taking it.  Oh, private, private industry cross breeds cattle with bison and then sells them as bison.  
**[1:20:41-1:20:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:20:41):**  That's a political, that's a political ploy.  They're using the animal as a tool, and some buzzwords to fool you.  And so when they actually have cattle in aggression, they're there, there.  
**[1:20:55-1:21:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:20:55):**  It's out there.  And there's data that's published coming from some of these parks.  And some of these people, their cattle are just as dirty as everybody else's.  
**[1:21:11-1:21:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:21:11):**  I should say cattle.  Their bison have cattle in aggression popping up all the time.  And then in 2009, you could have had a cow with the mitochondrial DNA test clean.  
**[1:21:26-1:21:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:21:26):**  And then in 2012, if you did another, instead of the nuclei or the, what the heck, there's  two different types.  But anyways, the technology's still getting better.  
**[1:21:38-1:21:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:21:38):**  We're finding better and better samples of bison frozen in the tundras of Siberia and  Alaska and then in the caves of Texas and everywhere else where we're able to extract  DNA to get a bigger picture pre-European times.  
**[1:21:54-1:22:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:21:54):**  So the science isn't even settled yet.  And the data set is so small.  So if they're using cattle in aggression to sway you one way or the other, my advice to  
**[1:22:09-1:22:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:22:09):**  you is take a step back and try to really listen between the lines of what they're trying  to sell you.  Okay.  
**[1:22:16-1:22:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:22:16):**  I mean, that makes sense.  And to go along with what you're saying about the national park herds, you might remember  this about 10 years ago.  
**[1:22:26-1:22:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:22:26):**  And I heard this from my friends down south of me that are also in the bison business,  whose name I won't mention.  They told me that the government refused to test the Yellowstone herd because they said  
**[1:22:39-1:22:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:22:39):**  it was pure and they didn't need to test it.  But it was kind of like a secret that everybody in the bison industry knew that they were  interbred with cattle and had cattle DNA.  
**[1:22:50-1:23:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:22:50):**  Do I have any of that right?  I cannot comment or confirm any of that situation there.  That was the story, but I don't have firsthand knowledge of that.  
**[1:23:04-1:23:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:23:04):**  But that story is floating around there.  But Yellowstone animals are around and like heck, last weekend, Ted Turner made that deal  where he would quarantine them and then he gets to keep the offspring.  
**[1:23:21-1:23:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:23:21):**  And there was 10 bulls that sold for $15,000 a piece.  So were they worth that?  Oh, yeah, they're Yellowstone genetics.  
**[1:23:33-1:23:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:23:33):**  Because it's like an outcross.  Is that what it is?  What makes a Yellowstone genetic special?  
**[1:23:39-1:23:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:23:39):**  Well, it's been limited.  Everything coming out of Yellowstone is killed.  Everything that comes out of Yellowstone is killed.  
**[1:23:50-1:23:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:23:50):**  So that's like a whole new resource of genetics.  Right.  And it's Yellowstone.  
**[1:23:55-1:24:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:23:55):**  And the TV show and the big park and then the scarcity, they're 1987 classic top Air  Force Ones is what they are.  They're just a pair of shoes.  
**[1:24:14-1:24:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:24:14):**  But we paid a pretty penny for Yellowstone animals too.  So don't worry.  I've got in on the hype.  
**[1:24:22-1:24:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:24:22):**  But we've also got Teddy Roosevelt, Badlands, Wichita Mountains, Caprock Canyons.  We've got what?  I think we've got six of the main seven heritage herds.  
**[1:24:36-1:24:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:24:36):**  So we're trying to do our part.  And we're just trying to hold on to those genetics because anything can happen.  And keep them viable.  
**[1:24:49-1:25:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:24:49):**  You guys have any issues with and you don't have to answer this inbreeding?  No, I don't.  One we're kind of a bigger herd.  
**[1:25:01-1:25:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:25:01):**  And then we're always running heavy bulls.  So like right now, you know, I've got 250 yearling coming two year old bulls.  They're probably going to be able to they're able to mount a cow.  
**[1:25:16-1:25:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:25:16):**  They might get a bred.  But then I'm kind of always running heavy on bulls because I've got hunt bulls out there.  I've got trophy bulls.  
**[1:25:25-1:25:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:25:25):**  I've got I'm always heavy on bulls.  And then we're always bringing in, you know, two to three, sometimes eight bulls a year  just to keep it fresh.  
**[1:25:35-1:25:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:25:35):**  That's good.  Yeah.  It just reminded me of like the Holstein genetics.  
**[1:25:40-1:25:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:25:40):**  I think was there seven lineages that they can trace every Holstein cow to?  My husband actually just cut out a two headed calf out of a cow last week.  And I thought that was it's line breeding when it works.  
**[1:25:54-1:25:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:25:54):**  It's inbreeding when it doesn't.  Right.  Yeah, I thought it was I didn't.  
**[1:25:59-1:26:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:25:59):**  Is it seven?  I thought it was like three or four less now.  But I've always heard seven being thrown around.  
**[1:26:08-1:26:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:26:08):**  Yeah, it's it.  I know there's a huge bottleneck with the with the Holstein breed.  And it goes back to like either three or seven animals that they're all getting semen from  
**[1:26:17-1:26:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:26:17):**  and still using some of that, that semen.  And you know, like some of these registered breeds, right?  With embryo transfer and semen straws going all over the country.  
**[1:26:35-1:26:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:26:35):**  You know, that's a man made bottleneck.  And it is.  And so, you know, you guys do you guys AI or no?  
**[1:26:43-1:26:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:26:43):**  Is it all live cover?  Oh, just so you know, yeah.  Colorado.  
**[1:26:53-1:27:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:26:53):**  I don't know if it was Colorado State or if it was the the arm.  There's the the the old bombing run there on the outskirts of Denver, or right there  in the in between Denver and the airport.  
**[1:27:09-1:27:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:27:09):**  I can't them or if it was CSU, but they did some they did some AI stuff.  And it was for brucellosis research or whatever.  Right, right.  
**[1:27:20-1:27:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:27:20):**  Okay.  No, we're not.  I can't imagine that being fun.  
**[1:27:26-1:27:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:27:26):**  Not fun.  We're sarcasm for sure.  The best way to talk to a cattle guy about bison is, is we're pretty much how cows used  
**[1:27:35-1:27:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:27:35):**  to be.  Yeah.  So we're not we're not pulling calves.  
**[1:27:40-1:27:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:27:40):**  We're out on pasture more.  Yeah.  And the bulls are out there all year.  
**[1:27:48-1:27:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:27:48):**  So you're your bulls are out there all year, right?  Mine are most producers pull their bulls house them in a different pasture.  Okay.  
**[1:27:57-1:28:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:27:57):**  So now the question is, do your cows have any sort of synced up defined calving season  that they naturally fall in because of the management and your forage and feed availability?  Or they just spread out everywhere?  
**[1:28:10-1:28:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:28:10):**  No, so, but they will they will spread out everywhere.  So since we're not feeding any hay or supplemental feed, we're drawn.  So like right now, the body condition of my cows is starting has peaked.  
**[1:28:30-1:28:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:28:30):**  And so by March, I want them to come back down to like a six, almost a five.  And so right now, Christmas time, they should look good first year, winter solstice comes  around, they're looking great.  
**[1:28:47-1:29:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:28:47):**  They're big fat, sassy, happy.  And now forage is getting more and more it's 100% dormant, temperatures are colder, they're  caloric, you know, goes up, their caloric need goes up.  
**[1:29:03-1:29:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:29:03):**  And their actual forage intake should be going down just a hair.  And we're pushing them a little harder, and then they've got a calf growing in them.  So then their body conditions start going down just like this.  
**[1:29:14-1:29:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:29:14):**  And we consider our green up the 15th of March.  And that's when we should start calving.  So we'll start getting just that little tiny shoots.  
**[1:29:23-1:29:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:29:23):**  And then they'll calve and then that grass will hit and then they should bounce right  back up.  And so yes, we do have a natural window.  
**[1:29:32-1:29:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:29:32):**  But it is assisted with an ultrasound machine.  But for the most part, they fall between that March 15, May 15.  Well, that's because are they their long day breeders in right?  
**[1:29:47-1:29:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:29:47):**  Or is it short?  Is that what it is?  They like more sunlight during the photo period during the day, right?  
**[1:29:55-1:30:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:29:55):**  Instead of go to like shorter photo periods.  Okay, yeah.  I would propose that that has more to do with the forage on long sunny days in the summer.  
**[1:30:07-1:30:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:30:07):**  And not sunlight.  Not the actual sunlight itself.  Not with the boys.  
**[1:30:14-1:30:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:30:14):**  They're ready whenever.  No, well, yeah, they'll do it whenever.  Any species will.  
**[1:30:25-1:30:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:30:25):**  But they're running hard, like they're bellowing and they're fighting and they're, Oh, God,  it's just it's awesome.  You know, like, I've been doing this for 1617 years now.  
**[1:30:39-1:30:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:30:39):**  And when the rut hits and you see some bulls getting after it and doing their thing.  It's it's stop the pickup, watch and enjoy it.  But it's always the same time, 20th of July, 20th of July.  
**[1:30:57-1:31:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:30:57):**  It's dead hard.  They, you know, they start, you know, it starts, they start, then bulls start moving and doing  some weird things around the 4th of July and then about the 20th of July.  
**[1:31:08-1:31:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:31:08):**  It's bam, bam, bam.  And it's just, it's just, it's just fun.  And then that carries through.  
**[1:31:17-1:31:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:31:17):**  So so I think it's the sunlight.  I'm with you.  It's the photo.  
**[1:31:23-1:31:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:31:23):**  What's the real word for it?  I mean, I have to put July 20th on my calendar.  Go visit and go drive down to the Z bar and go drive on July 20th and see what's going  
**[1:31:36-1:31:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:31:36):**  on.  Oh, yeah, that's right.  You got Keith and you're right next to you.  
**[1:31:40-1:31:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:31:40):**  I wasn't going to mention their name.  Oh, sorry.  Oh, geez.  
**[1:31:44-1:31:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:31:44):**  I didn't say his last name.  Didn't say last name.  That's fine.  
**[1:31:49-1:31:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:31:49):**  I'm sure he won't mind.  We didn't say anything bad.  So no, he's a cool cat.  
**[1:31:55-1:32:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:31:55):**  He doesn't even look like a bison rancher.  He's just he's always on vacation.  It looks like he doesn't even look like he's a rancher even when he's ranching.  
**[1:32:05-1:32:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:32:05):**  I know he's a cool, cool cat.  Yeah, he did catch some heat from his employers several years ago.  Like he literally got threatened that he couldn't wear Crocs anymore to work.  
**[1:32:20-1:32:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:32:20):**  Well, safety hazard, man.  He puts them in four wheel drive.  Okay, he puts a strap on the back.  
**[1:32:30-1:32:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:32:30):**  That's what that means.  Yeah.  Crocs are super comfy, but they are.  
**[1:32:38-1:32:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:32:38):**  You can break your foot real quick.  You know, we're in Yale together, obviously.  I've been working on the employee handbook and in the employee handbook, it does say  
**[1:32:51-1:33:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:32:51):**  that long pants will be worn all the time.  And like Cody and Justin, when it's 105, and if they're doing an animal move that day,  if they're not welding, you know, or doing something like that, they wear their cargo  
**[1:33:08-1:33:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:33:08):**  shorts.  So yeah, we're going to probably have to amend that or just ignore it, but whatever.  Or bleep that section out.  
**[1:33:16-1:33:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:33:16):**  Yeah, we're also a tobacco free workspace too.  So how's that working out for you?  Fantastic.  
**[1:33:25-1:33:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:33:25):**  So yeah, it says in the handbook, it says it right here in the handbook, so I can be  fired at any time.  So if you wear shorts, you can be fired at any time.  
**[1:33:39-1:33:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:33:39):**  So yeah, so for violating the policy.  So it's written down and can be referred to when necessary.  You need a reason, right?  
**[1:33:53-1:34:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:33:53):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know how that meme says, you know, those kids can read, they'd be pretty mad at you  
**[1:34:00-1:34:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:34:00):**  right now.  That's us, right?  That's us.  
**[1:34:07-1:34:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:34:07):**  If we can read, we'd probably be pretty bad.  A lot of times I feel like the kid on the outside trying to hold up the sign when I'm  talking about soil health or, you know, regenerative ag.  
**[1:34:19-1:34:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:34:19):**  Yeah.  Yeah, that's one thing, regenerative ag.  You know, like I mentioned that fire in Kansas, and then that's been overshadowed by that  
**[1:34:33-1:34:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:34:33):**  fire in Colorado, Colorado.  Oh, that was woo!  Wowsers.  
**[1:34:42-1:34:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:34:42):**  And, you know, you live in grass country, I live in grass country.  We've all known, we've had friends and neighbors lose everything from a lightning started grass  fire, from a tourist started grass fire, or even equipment started grass fire.  
**[1:34:58-1:35:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:34:58):**  And you know, that just made national news.  But what was the effect?  And I may be opening up a can of worms, but, you know, I was kind of meditating on that  
**[1:35:09-1:35:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:35:09):**  because, you know, they put the call out clear up here said, you know, units, you know, and  you know, we didn't have anybody available, but we didn't send anybody.  I got to thinking about that.  
**[1:35:20-1:35:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:35:20):**  And, you know, when I used to go down into that country in the late 90s, there wasn't  nothing there, you know, and now it's all just subdivisions.  And you think about all that rainwater that's going sideways then into forced drainages.  
**[1:35:39-1:35:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:35:39):**  Yep, that used to be going into the soil or going down a natural drainage.  Now it's right on a roof or on concrete going unnatural, you know, and then I don't know  if it was abnormally warm that day or whatever.  
**[1:35:52-1:36:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:35:52):**  But, you know, I got to thinking, gosh, you know, urban interface in the fire industry  is just a changing fire site, you know, there's so much urban interface with wildland and  urban.  
**[1:36:04-1:36:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:36:04):**  And I was just trying to imagine to put myself there, but how much of that was affected by  blacktop or wind moving through structures?  I don't want to go down that road to say, you know, you don't have the right to build.  
**[1:36:17-1:36:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:36:17):**  I think somebody should probably who's smarter than me should probably look into that.  I don't know.  I think we need to be more aware of what we are building and where we're building it.  
**[1:36:30-1:36:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:36:30):**  Like a lot of the houses that burned up in the wildfires we had here, you know, in 1617  and then down in Oklahoma in 2018, all the structures that were lost at, okay, not all,  can't say that somebody will fact check me.  
**[1:36:47-1:37:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:36:47):**  Most of the structures that were lost had Eastern Red Cedar trees within 50 yards of  the house.  Like when the Starbucks fire happened in 2017, I went over there and of 13 houses that got  
**[1:37:04-1:37:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:37:04):**  burnt down, 11 of them had cedar trees right next to them.  Like, okay, so for context, Eastern Red Cedar, it's a juniper, it's a coniferous tree, it's  got a lot of heavy oils in it and it burns like gasoline when it gets fire on it.  
**[1:37:21-1:37:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:37:21):**  Why would you put those near your house if you live in the middle of grasslands that  for six months out of the year are basically a tinderbox?  Didn't make sense to me.  
**[1:37:32-1:37:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:37:32):**  After the fire in 2016, my dad had a row of cedar, had two rows of cedar trees behind  his house.  Funny story, he planted them there.  
**[1:37:41-1:37:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:37:41):**  He transplanted them there in the late 90s.  This was after he'd already been on the ranch for 15 years, burning trees, cutting trees,  and cleaning the place up.  
**[1:37:54-1:38:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:37:54):**  So he decides he wants a windbreak on the north side of his house.  He goes and gets a tree spade from the conservation district.  He goes out on the ranch to look for trees.  
**[1:38:02-1:38:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:38:02):**  Can't find any.  Can't find enough trees on 7,000 acres to transplant a windrow behind his house.  So he had to go to the neighbor's property and requisition some trees.  
**[1:38:23-1:38:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:38:23):**  He put that shelter belt behind the house.  Another little funny story, the guy that was riding that pasture that he stole the trees  out of, he came up to my dad one day at the bar and he's like, Ted, there's something  
**[1:38:37-1:38:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:38:37):**  really strange going on out here in a pasture.  I got to show you this.  So of course, my dad immediately knew.  
**[1:38:47-1:39:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:38:47):**  He instantly knew what Gene was on about, but he had to play along.  So they go out to this pasture and he takes them out to this spot where dad had taken  a tree and put back a plug of soil.  
**[1:39:00-1:39:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:39:00):**  So it's like there's a plug of soil in there that's six inches down from everything  else and the grass has turned like 90 degrees and Gene's standing there going, there's  a bunch more of these, Ted.  
**[1:39:10-1:39:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:39:10):**  I don't know what's going on.  I think dad messed with them for a minute, but he did tell him like, no, I came over  here and stole these trees.  
**[1:39:19-1:39:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:39:19):**  They're behind my house in a shelter belt.  So in 2016, when that wildfire came through, we had a wildfire come right past that house  in 2008.  
**[1:39:33-1:39:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:39:33):**  It was a lot of work to keep fire out of that shelter belt, even though that day the wind  was out of the south, so it would have been blowing away from the house.  Anderson Creek in 2016, the wind was out of the northwest when it came by the house and  
**[1:39:47-1:39:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:39:47):**  those trees are on the north side.  I managed to keep fire out of there again.  About two months after that, I finally caught my breath from rebuilding fence and getting  
**[1:39:59-1:40:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:39:59):**  cows back on the ranch and getting where I was going to make a living again.  I had a day and I was just sitting there in the yard and I looked at my skid steer and  looked at those trees and I looked at the mulcher head and I put all three of them together  
**[1:40:15-1:40:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:40:15):**  and I made those trees go away in about three hours.  Dad came out and he was like, well, it's going to be awful cold in the house this winter.  I said, well, it's better than being hot for one day.  
**[1:40:26-1:40:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:40:26):**  Really being really hot for one day.  I'm not messing with trying to keep fire out of these trees again.  They're getting too big.  
**[1:40:34-1:40:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:40:34):**  They're too close.  If the fire gets in these, your house is gone.  That's it.  
**[1:40:39-1:40:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:40:39):**  It's gone.  Being aware of where you're at, like the wildland urban interface has always been a problem  for firefighters and that situation is not going to improve at all.  
**[1:40:56-1:41:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:40:56):**  I have to look at the management of those interface areas.  We can control the management on our ranches.  We can manage a dangerous fuel load on our ranches because it's our private property.  
**[1:41:08-1:41:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:41:08):**  We kind of get to do what we want for the most part.  Part of that for me is managing a fuel load if I want to burn or if I want to protect  an area from burning.  
**[1:41:20-1:41:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:41:20):**  I think that as people move out into these urban wildland interface zones, because they  want to live near nature, it's so pretty.  It's not always pretty when it's been conserved and not managed at all.  
**[1:41:37-1:41:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:41:37):**  Overgrown forest is way more of a fire hazard than anything else.  We see that in the mountains.  I'm sure you see that in the Black Hills, your trips through Colorado.  
**[1:41:49-1:42:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:41:49):**  CK, I know you see it out there in Idaho.  Just like we're relearning to manage our grasslands better.  The way we did it, the way we all learned how to do it, the way we've been doing it  
**[1:42:02-1:42:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:42:02):**  previously.  I think most of our listeners, and I know the three of us can all agree, didn't work.  That's why we're all trying to do stuff differently.  
**[1:42:12-1:42:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:42:12):**  I think we need to start looking at the federal lands management, BLM, Forest Service, whatever  you want to look at, whatever you want to call it.  Public lands are the worst managed.  
**[1:42:25-1:42:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:42:25):**  They're not managed at all.  They're not managed to the point of intentional neglect, which leads to dangerous fuel build-up.  Dangerous fuel build-up.  
**[1:42:36-1:42:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:42:36):**  You have a situation like happened in Colorado, where fire gets going, where there hasn't  been any logging, grazing, any anal impact allowed.  That fire just roars right into town because the forest is so overgrown and over thick  
**[1:42:52-1:43:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:42:52):**  with brush.  Fire just runs into town and runs right through town.  That shouldn't happen.  
**[1:43:00-1:43:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:43:00):**  There should be some kind of a buffer zone in between these dense urban areas and the  wild land where they could stop a fire.  That's just me.  
**[1:43:12-1:43:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:43:12):**  The thing is, there's two stakeholders in our management plan, us and nature.  That's a pretty easy management plan.  That's what happens.  
**[1:43:36-1:43:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:43:36):**  That's the problem.  Like I was going to say, you get a bunch of stakeholders.  When you get into a situation like that, you've got so many stakeholders in it.  
**[1:43:51-1:44:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:43:51):**  The plan just gets derailed or has to take a less effective route.  Maybe it's a little W right in the beginning, but a lot of them people, they didn't know.  They just bought a beautiful home.  
**[1:44:07-1:44:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:44:07):**  Those homes are beautiful.  Look at these beautiful trees right out the back door.  I know.  
**[1:44:12-1:44:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:44:12):**  They're beautiful.  They don't know.  But it was just something that I got to thinking.  
**[1:44:17-1:44:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:44:17):**  I drove through that area before and then I was just, and I need to go back down there.  I don't know exactly where it is, but I was thinking, gosh, there's probably something  to do at a, I don't know, maybe it was just a freak event, but you're right.  
**[1:44:33-1:44:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:44:33):**  There needs to be some management, some safety.  Especially with these large events, these large events, people become more fire wise,  like self removing the shelter belt.  
**[1:44:46-1:45:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:44:46):**  Maybe we shouldn't have actual dead, like even around here, I was sent, in our own fire  district, I was sent to protect a house.  And I mean, the grass was thigh high up close to the house.  
**[1:45:03-1:45:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:45:03):**  There was wood stacked under the deck and everything else and full of duff and litter  and leaves.  And, you know, I mean, we get that everywhere.  
**[1:45:15-1:45:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:45:15):**  But, you know, it comes right back down to personal responsibility.  But in that situation where the radiant heat of your neighbor's house catches on fire,  catches your other house on fire, catches the other house on fire, just through radiant  
**[1:45:31-1:45:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:45:31):**  heat, it's not even actual flame contact, it's radiating heat that's so hot that it  combusts.  So, yeah, it's just tragic.  
**[1:45:42-1:45:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:45:42):**  You know, maybe, maybe we make them more than eight feet apart.  I don't know.  You know, I don't know.  
**[1:45:51-1:46:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:45:51):**  I hate to laugh because there's so many, you know, what is there, a thousand, thousand  homeless families down there, but I don't want to laugh too deep and have to be recorded  and broadcasted.  
**[1:46:01-1:46:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:46:01):**  But, but yeah, hopefully there's some lessons learned there.  And yeah, and hopefully we, but you know, animal agriculture and holistic management  are getting little wins everywhere, you know, through goats, you know, I hate to go back  
**[1:46:13-1:46:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:46:13):**  to goats, but there's these, you know, people with goats, these, and, you know, they've  got, they're getting W's because they're winning in areas that are in urban areas or public  lands, you know, controlling noxious weeds or something like that, or knocking down fuels.

**[1:46:59-1:47:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:46:59):**  And it ends up on Instagram and Snapchat, and there's a pick your color, a cow that's  standing there to be the culprit, you know, and then the land baron cattle man behind  it, you know, that's, and here's this cow knee deep in a stream coming out of a busted  
**[1:47:21-1:47:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:47:21):**  float out of a poorly managed tank and, you know, just busting the crap out of that and  they think it's a, you know, pristine trout stream, you know, and, you know, if, if we  can control that stuff and make that stuff go away, but it's that stuff happens all the  
**[1:47:41-1:47:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:47:41):**  time.  You know, you lose a float or a float gets stuck or something happens and, you know,  you have that stuff happen all the time.  
**[1:47:49-1:47:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:47:49):**  But, you know, that's the thing you've got, you got both sides on one side, we got the  narrative that we're trying to project that we're, we're cleaning up and doing good with  animal agriculture.  
**[1:47:59-1:48:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:47:59):**  And then on the flip side of it, you got that one half of 1% guy with a, you know, lease  and granddaddy's always had a lease and I've always put 200 head up there and now the land  manager's going to tell me I can only put 150.  
**[1:48:16-1:48:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:48:16):**  He forgets to tell you that granddaddy's cows only weighed 900 pounds and his cows weigh  1700 pounds.  Right.  
**[1:48:24-1:48:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:48:24):**  You know, and he's calving in December because he wants his calves to be fully grown and  survive the truck ride to the hills and everything else, you know, I mean, it's just, it's just  insane.  
**[1:48:38-1:48:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:48:38):**  But no, I mean, we all got to get on board and stick together and try to control that  narrative and do the best we can.  And then hopefully, you know, you know, things will change because it's because, you know,  
**[1:48:52-1:49:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:48:52):**  even, you know, don't we say it all the time, don't blame the cow blame the how and we got  to and you know, it's not just the cow it's don't blame the protein blame the how because,  you know, we could be doing it with sheep, we could be doing it with goats, we could  
**[1:49:09-1:49:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:49:09):**  be doing it with cattle, we could be doing it with other emulents, we could be doing  it with bison, we can, you know, even there's no one species that fits each as a whole,  but in each situation, we will find this species that fits.  
**[1:49:26-1:49:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:49:26):**  I'd agree with that.  I'd agree with that.  So,  
**[1:49:31-1:49:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:49:31):**  I just looked at the clock.  We're getting close.  All right, we need to wrap this up.  
**[1:49:36-1:49:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:49:36):**  Have we forgot to ask you anything?  Um, gosh, I don't know.  I just got that dang sliver in my finger.  
**[1:49:46-1:49:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:49:46):**  Yeah.  No, I think I know I think we covered the gamut.  I thought I'd tell you a little I probably should probably put a little more facts about  
**[1:49:56-1:50:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:49:56):**  bison and you know how it's so good for you.  And lay it on us.  Like what America's were supposed to eat.  
**[1:50:06-1:50:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:50:06):**  You know, but no, I mean, try bison.  I mean, I go to town and I get me a good beef steak every once in a while.  I ain't, I ain't afraid to produce my and you know, like, the bison guys ain't gonna  
**[1:50:20-1:50:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:50:20):**  outdo the cattle guys, we ain't gonna replace you.  And then when people say bison are the culprit, whether they get the bad name, you know, right  around, you know, the Yellowstone Park area, you know, brucellosis stuff like that whole  
**[1:50:36-1:50:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:50:36):**  state of Montana, just remember that there's no management plan up there.  You know, you know, that can be handled so much better.  They could have an auction, you know, they could they could they could do better roundups  
**[1:50:47-1:51:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:50:47):**  and they could convert, you know, mature animals into meat for or, or observe, you know, treaty  rights, heaven forbid that, you know, and have local indigenous people doing the harvest  and forum or something like that.  
**[1:51:03-1:51:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:51:03):**  So you know, if, if somebody tries to use bison in a bad light, you know, they usually  have an agenda, you know, good or bad.  And you know, there's some there's some groups using bison as a tool, you know, saying that,  
**[1:51:18-1:51:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:51:18):**  you know, they move themselves around and, you know, we can we can buy these large plots  of land and remove all the fence in the interior fencing.  And then bison are going to manage themselves and they're going to improve the ecosystem  
**[1:51:33-1:51:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:51:33):**  because they're the keystone species.  It doesn't work does it?  Well, no, because you're using Yeah, you're using two, 3 million acres, but not two minute,  
**[1:51:47-1:51:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:51:47):**  3 million acres that doesn't spread from northern Canada to northern Mexico.  And is there a predator pushing them?  Right.  
**[1:51:56-1:52:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:51:56):**  And or, you know, or, or tribes of people pushing them?  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  
**[1:52:04-1:52:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:52:04):**  So you got to remember the human species have been, has been having a footprint on the ecosystem  for a long, long time as far as management goes.  And so if somebody tells you that they've got a halo, you just remember that the pounds  
**[1:52:17-1:52:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:52:17):**  per square inch on the hoof of bison is the same as a cow.  And you got to remember the distance from the outside of the lip to their teeth is the  same.  
**[1:52:29-1:52:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:52:29):**  They can only graze down that far.  And they should only be grazing down that far if they're forced to.  Just like a cow, you know, a horse can graze down to that far, a goat can graze down to  
**[1:52:41-1:52:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:52:41):**  that far.  That's the distance because a horse has a way to move its lip and he has full teeth  on the top.  
**[1:52:50-1:53:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:52:50):**  Things like that.  So, you know, it, it goes against all the biology.  So you know, it's he's tearing up each footstep is a footstep.  
**[1:53:00-1:53:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:53:00):**  And each each, they're sticking that tongue out there and they're curling that tongue  and they're they're pulling leaf off of that plant.  And if you force them to bite it twice, well, you know, either you need to be moving them  
**[1:53:12-1:53:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:53:12):**  with water or pipeline, or you need to be moving them or you control them with fence  or herders.  You know, if you're gonna, you know, you can remove all the fence, but you better have  
**[1:53:21-1:53:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:53:21):**  a herder or herders, you know.  So I could, I can see that turning into a wreck.  Like not being able to find animals having having a group that just goes feral, that  
**[1:53:35-1:53:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:53:35):**  never gets seen.  But, you know, they're going to camp on those riparian areas.  Of course, they're going to graze them and then they're going to be somewhat some sub  
**[1:53:47-1:53:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:53:47):**  irrigated, you know, or they're in a drainage.  And so the water is going to drain there during a rain event.  So it's going to have higher moisture and then that's going to have, you know, your  
**[1:53:57-1:54:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:53:57):**  fastest growth.  And if and if that rain event comes back before a proper rest period for that plant species,  that's overgrazing.  
**[1:54:06-1:54:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:54:06):**  Plain and simple.  It's not the animal science.  It's time in science.  
**[1:54:15-1:54:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:54:15):**  That's it.  And so, and like I said, animals don't over graze, managers do.  And that's, that's just the way it is.  
**[1:54:26-1:54:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:54:26):**  And hopefully we can keep getting that message out there.  So I think that's a good spot to end.  Yeah.  
**[1:54:35-1:54:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:54:35):**  Well, it was good to see your face.  I'll probably see you in Colorado Springs.  Down there in the little sign there.  
**[1:54:47-1:54:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:54:47):**  Shake your hand down there in the corner.  There you go.  Perfect.  
**[1:54:52-1:54:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/47-Moritz-Espys-Being-a-Bison-Wrangler-e1d1sk7#t=1:54:52):**  Well, it was great to see you too Moritz and really thank you for joining us.  You bet.  Thank you, sir.

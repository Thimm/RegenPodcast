And I'm sitting down with a lady that contacted me on Instagram and reached out and wanted  to talk to me about some of my experiences about wildfire.  
**[0:00:53-0:01:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:00:53):**  So I'm kind of excited for this conversation.  So Ms. Domo Woodham, would you please introduce yourself?  Yeah, so I'm Domo Woodham.  
**[0:01:02-0:01:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:01:02):**  I work for Montana State University Extension.  And I'm a natural resources extension agent with a specialty in wildfire education.  And so most of what I'm doing is talking with people about how they can prepare for, respond  
**[0:01:17-0:01:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:01:17):**  to and recover from wildfire.  Awesome.  Awesome.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:01:22):**  So you had some questions for me.  And I guess I can roll right into those because you're supposed to be interviewing me.  Yes.  
**[0:01:30-0:01:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:01:30):**  And so, you know, maybe you want me to share a little bit of background about the project,  about how it all came to be.  And we'll go from there.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:01:37):**  Yeah, that'd be great.  Awesome.  So my position in Extension was pretty unique, because it was 100% grant funded.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:01:44):**  And so I had grants that funded me when I first came into the job.  And then I looked for others and kind of have used creativity and experiences to kind of  branch out what I do.  
**[0:01:55-0:02:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:01:55):**  So back in 2018, I was working with some partners of mine from the Northern Plains Climate Hub.  And we kind of did a grant proposal pitch competition, more or less.  And I pitched this idea that I wanted to do an agricultural producer discussion panel  
**[0:02:16-0:02:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:02:16):**  where people would share their wildfire lessons learned so that other people could learn from  their experiences.  And that proposal got selected for a small bit of funding.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:02:27):**  And so what we did was at the 2018 Wyoming Stock Growers Winter Roundup, we hosted this  discussion panel.  And we had two ranchers that were on the panel, as well as NRCS specialists and USDA Forest  
**[0:02:44-0:02:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:02:44):**  Service specialists that had worked with these two particular producers during their wildfire  experience.  Initially, we had, I think, an hour of time blocked out for the discussion.  
**[0:02:56-0:03:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:02:56):**  And I had about 25 questions that I had prepared that I was going to ask people.  And the audience took over.  People loved it.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:03:05):**  They, our discussion panel went on for two hours.  And I only made it through maybe three of my questions before folks from the audience  were raising their hands and, you know, either asking specific questions to individual people  
**[0:03:17-0:03:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:03:17):**  or posing them to the group.  And a couple things were realized while doing that was people love that.  People love learning from their peers.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:03:29):**  They love learning from experiences, that tangible stuff that you can apply to your  own life.  People absolutely love that.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:03:36):**  And it's way more, I guess, receptive to people rather than, you know, maybe having a specialist  or someone maybe from a university saying like, you should do this and this based on  this research.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:03:48):**  People want to see the direct on the ground experience and what happened.  And that's so invaluable.  And so, as a result of the discussion panel, we made a couple of really nice posters that  
**[0:03:59-0:04:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:03:59):**  had select quotes from each of those people.  And you know, we distributed those and they were really cool.  But that kind of always stuck with me was how can we go bigger with this?  
**[0:04:09-0:04:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:04:09):**  How can we reach more people?  Because the other thing I've learned over the years was I worked in fire management  for 12 and a half years before extension.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:04:17):**  And every time there's a wildfire, there's a couple things that happen.  Folks will act like it's the first time there's ever been a wildfire that's impacted them.  And that's not the case.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:04:29):**  Typically, you know, this happens over and over all over the country.  And so, because it happens over and over all over the country, we tend to have other areas  memories as human beings for things like that.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:04:40):**  Yes.  And so and that was the thing was, you know, how can I bring everyone's stories and experiences  together?  
**[0:04:46-0:05:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:04:46):**  So last year, I got a small grant, or I guess it was a sub contract from the Montana DNRC  to do wildfire lessons learned for agriculture and rural communities.  And with that project, I've both been traveling around Montana, mainly doing interviews via  
**[0:05:04-0:05:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:05:04):**  email, phone call podcasts, and talking to people and learning what what's their wildfire  story.  And it could have been anything.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:05:14):**  It could have been how they prepared for wildfire, how they responded, how they recovered or  didn't recover.  And then what did they learn?  
**[0:05:21-0:05:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:05:21):**  And if they could do it over, or if they could share any juicy nuggets of advice, what would  it be?  And that has been a blast.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:05:30):**  I've talked with folks in Montana, Wyoming, Washington, Colorado, and now Kansas.  And so wildfire is something that's near and dear to me as is agriculture.  And so I just I'm really happy to be able to bring everything together.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:05:44):**  That's great.  Thank you.  Thank you for sharing that.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:05:47):**  That gives me a little that gives me a lot more context.  And it also gave me gave me a little bit of time to make some notes here.  So I'm Brian Alexander.  
**[0:05:56-0:06:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:05:56):**  Most folks, a lot of folks will know me as Red Hills rancher on social media and be Instagram,  Facebook, Twitter, and TikTok, where I'm most active.  Where I live, I'm in South Central Kansas in the Red Hills.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:06:08):**  My management context is we get about 24 inches of rain, 22 to 24 inches of rain in a normal  average year.  And normal is just a setting on a dryer.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:06:18):**  And we never get that.  And it's never evenly distributed between growing season and dormant season.  And there's a lot of variability in our humidity as well.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:06:29):**  We can have cool, cool humid summers, we can have warm, dry summers, we can have warm,  humid summers, we can have cool.  We can have almost any variation of weather here.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:06:39):**  So it does make for a challenge to manage in.  So my occupation as I'm a full time rancher.  I am a ecological engineer or a grazing engineer.  
**[0:06:52-0:07:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:06:52):**  I fix land problems with livestock, or at least that's how I've been trying to brand  myself for years.  I've been through ranching for profit several times.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:07:03):**  And I've also been through holistic management.  I briefly considered being a holistic management certified educator, but I think I've been  called and pulled in a different direction.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:07:14):**  So throughout my life, and I've had an early exposure to a lot of these holistic concepts  and ranching for profit principles.  So the history of the ranch is, like I said, it's 7000 acres of native grassland.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:07:37):**  And there was about 500 acres of it that was farmed at one point and broken out.  That's all been back to grass for 30 plus years.  So the land that I currently am privileged enough to be the steward of was originally  
**[0:07:54-0:08:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:07:54):**  started to be put together by my family as early as I can tell around 1906, when some  of my first ancestors came to this area.  And I can't really find out much about those early days, but I know in the 30s, there were  
**[0:08:07-0:08:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:08:07):**  sheep on the ranch, and possibly even up to the 50s.  And then in the late 40s, a great, great grandfather discovered oil.  He kind of decided he was going to go be an oil man and didn't really care much about  
**[0:08:20-0:08:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:08:20):**  the ranch.  And from about the mid 50s until 1984, when my dad got control over it, the ranch was  leased out and operated by others.  
**[0:08:31-0:08:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:08:31):**  It wasn't well managed.  So when dad took it over in 84, he described it as, he's going to yell at me these days.  I don't always have this quote just exactly right.  
**[0:08:40-0:09:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:08:40):**  But it was an overgrazed, underutilized cedar forest without any water.  And he spent his life learning how to manage the grass.  And even though the term really didn't exist at the time, begin the process of regeneration  
**[0:09:00-0:09:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:09:00):**  and restoring the native habitat of the ranch.  That's what he chose to do when he got control of the ranch, is he chose to spend any capital  of startup money he had on improving the resource that he had rather than going out and buying  
**[0:09:14-0:09:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:09:14):**  cows, which is what a typical response would be.  And because he didn't know anything about cows, but he knew he could do something with  the land that he had and learn how to make it make money without needing to own cows.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:09:26):**  And that's what ranching for profit taught him.  So my experience with fire is...  I will jump in here.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:09:34):**  And I just want to say, I did, I heard you speak at the Grass Fed Exchange two years  ago.  And that's why I wanted to reach out to you, because I remember you talking and sharing  
**[0:09:44-0:09:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:09:44):**  about this wildfire.  And that was one of those things like, hmm, you know, this is a great story to be able  to share with a bigger audience rather than who's sitting in this room right now here  
**[0:09:54-0:09:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:09:54):**  in Sonoma.  So I am so excited.  We get to hear this again.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:09:59):**  And you know, even two years down the line, you know, I've been able to make, you know,  some more observations and, you know, hopefully we have time to get into that and I can share  that with you later.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:10:09):**  So my experience with fire, I'm 42 now.  When I was eight, my dad handed me a drip torch and said, walk that way.  So we've got a long history of being borderline pyromaniacs out here in the Red Hills.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:10:25):**  So I have a very long history with prescribed fire.  I also spent a little over eight years in the Navy.  And while I was in the Navy, I was an engineer.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:10:33):**  And if you know anything about the Navy at all, and shipboard life, if you're an engineer,  you are also a firefighter, guaranteed.  It doesn't matter what you want to do as an engineer, you are a firefighter.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:10:45):**  And if you're on the ship, you're going to have to learn firefighting somehow.  So I worked my way up and I qualified some fairly high levels of damage control.  And eventually I was part of the damage control training team, teaching, you know, teaching  
**[0:10:59-0:11:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:10:59):**  techniques and how to fight fires and control damage on a ship.  So I brought a lot of that management experience back with me when I returned home in 2006.  And I've kind of stepped into a leadership role with our prescribed burn association  
**[0:11:15-0:11:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:11:15):**  on our local burn group.  There's several people that approached me for advice and planning about how to execute  their burn.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:11:23):**  And there's several people that kind of depend on me to be their burn boss on their property.  So it's, it's something going back.  So I had similar experience where I grew up in Alaska, my family had hay fields that we  
**[0:11:37-0:11:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:11:37):**  would burn every single spring.  My grandpa, my uncle, myself, and we didn't use drip torches.  We just did it old school with, you know, lighter and rakes and running around.  
**[0:11:47-0:12:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:11:47):**  And I guess this is something I think back on because, you know, that's, that was my  introduction to fire and prescribed burning in particular with you, you know, running  around with a drip torch at eight, when your dad would line you out, did he tell you why  
**[0:12:01-0:12:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:12:01):**  you guys were burning everything?  Or was it kind of like, this is just something we do?  Well, back in the early days, it was, you know, I always understood that it was a way  
**[0:12:10-0:12:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:12:10):**  to get rid of the cedar trees.  I understood from a really early age that the eastern red cedar tree was a bad thing  on the grasslands.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:12:18):**  And we can get into that later.  I've got a ton of research and, you know, things we can talk about to show grassland  biome conversion to closed canopy juniper forest.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:12:30):**  And the researchers that are behind this project at University of Nebraska-Lincoln are like,  they're within a hair's breadth of figuring out the economic impact of eastern red cedar  tree encroachment on the Great Plains due to loss of forage production.

**[0:12:52-0:12:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:12:52):**  So what was your question?  Like when you guys, when you were young and you were...  Oh, okay.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:12:58):**  The context of fire, right.  So I understood for a pretty early age that, you know, we had to burn to control the cedar  trees.  
**[0:13:05-0:13:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:13:05):**  I tell you what, if you've never seen a big sack of eastern red cedar or other juniper  go up in a giant ball of fire, that's just a column of black smoke, 10,000 feet high.  I mean, literally 10,000 feet high.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:13:21):**  And you can feel the heat a quarter of a mile away.  And you know that you planned that.  You know, you briefed the team and your guys did that according to your plan.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:13:34):**  And you just get to sit back and watch this massive, beautiful act of regeneration and  rejuvenation take place on the Plains.  Like that is a great feeling.  
**[0:13:46-0:14:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:13:46):**  But we're not here to talk about prescribed fire.  You know, you're talking about burning hay fields in Alaska every year.  And, you know, there's a lot to be said about contextually appropriate management and burning  
**[0:14:01-0:14:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:14:01):**  is just one of...  Burning can be one of those tools in the managers toolbox.  But the point I was kind of making is like, you know, when a lot of people think about  
**[0:14:11-0:14:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:14:11):**  fire and prescribed fire, a lot of people are familiar with it on a very small scale,  like, you know, burning a CRP field or burning a hay field that may have a road around it  on all four sides.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:14:23):**  And it's, you know, only 50 acres and you know, you can pick kind of a nice calm evening  and be done in two hours.  We don't have that luxury out here on the Plains.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:14:31):**  You know, we need to burn.  Last year as a burn association in our area, we burned about, I think, a little over 10,000  acres.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:14:40):**  I forgot to have that number handy.  And most of those were spring burns, which would be late dormant season.  We did a few summer burns.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:14:49):**  And we can talk about, you know, timing of that later.  But that's prescribed burning.  We're not talking about that.  
**[0:14:56-0:15:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:14:56):**  So we figured that we need to be burning almost 100,000 acres within just within our association's  umbrella area, so to speak, the area that we cover.  We need to be doing 10 times the burning that we are.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:15:11):**  And we're one of the most active groups in the state.  We are, we are the oldest burn association in the state.  Like we founded the 501c3.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:15:19):**  I was a founding member of that.  And then our local group, that group grew and we turned that over and that became the  state prescribed burn association that has spawned, I can't even tell you how many daughter  
**[0:15:31-0:15:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:15:31):**  chapters throughout the state.  So fire culture and acceptance of fire culture and knowing how to be a successful practitioner  of prescribed fire and knowing when it's contextually appropriate to pull that tool out of your  
**[0:15:45-0:15:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:15:45):**  toolbox is wildfire prevention, which wildfire is really what we want to talk about today,  right?  I love talking about everything fire, but yeah, get back on track.  
**[0:15:56-0:16:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:15:56):**  Okay.  So the wildfire experience that I'd really like to share is would be the Anderson Creek  wildfire in 2016.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:16:04):**  So that's coming up, you know, the five year anniversary of that is coming up on two week.  In fact, four years ago, right now, I was in Las Vegas.  And there was another fire burning within 40 miles of here called the Starbucks fire  
**[0:16:21-0:16:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:16:21):**  that was much bigger than Anderson Creek.  I think Starbucks ended up being around 640,000 acres.  But it's classified as a complex fire.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:16:31):**  Anderson Creek wildfire was a point source wildfire and it burned, I think, I think the  official revised number is somewhere around 343,000.  Okay.  
**[0:16:42-0:17:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:16:42):**  So the conditions leading up to Anderson Creek in 2016 is, you know, there's some cattle  market factors that are kind of involved that, you know, shorten up cattle numbers and put,  you know, took grass out of production, you know, took some cattle off of grass.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:17:00):**  That was also kind of a wetter period in this area during the growing season.  So we grew a tremendous amount of grass and not everybody, you know, not everybody, myself  included was effective at utilizing the grass that grew.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:17:13):**  So there was a lot of grass left over that just stayed around.  And the winter of 2016 was exceptionally dry and it was fairly warm.  I was working on a tree clearing project all winter.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:17:26):**  And I was within, I was within probably three or four days of being done, wrapping it up,  putting a bow on it and hauling my gear out back to the yard when Anderson Creek wildfire  hit.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:17:38):**  And on that hit I had, I had a lot of money wrapped up in my tree clearing operation,  sitting out in the pasture and a fire went right through it and like two tires on my  trailer and one tire on an attachment.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:17:50):**  That was it.  Like the rest of my machinery was fine.  So anyway, back to conditions leading up to that.  
**[0:17:54-0:18:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:17:54):**  So the winter of 2016 was exceptionally dry and it was, you know, it was fairly warm.  So we had a lot of forage.  We had a lot of fuel load, had a lot of what, you know, you know, those in an O'Cauley fine  
**[0:18:05-0:18:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:18:05):**  fuel, we had a lot of fine fuel loading that was dry going into the end of March.  Normally, our green up is about here, is typically 15 March.  Is, is when we have enough cool season grass that, that it will actually start to kind  
**[0:18:21-0:18:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:18:21):**  of impede fire progress a little bit.  Generally that's, you know, when the spring humidity starts coming in and, you know, because  as we all know, you know, humidity is a huge factor in fire.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:18:31):**  You know, as long as your humidity is above 20%, your risk of wildfire is fairly small  unless your temperature is over 80 degrees, but we can get into those later.  So it was almost the perfect storm and looking back, I can see this weather pattern repeated  
**[0:18:45-0:18:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:18:45):**  so many times in the late winter.  You know, it's the polar vortex wind pattern.  We're having it literally right now.  
**[0:18:53-0:19:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:18:53):**  We've got several days of really strong hot, dry south winds.  Then a front will come through and that will drive a rapid switch from the south to the  northwest and the really bad fires that we've had in this area.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:19:07):**  And there's been, there were bad fires in, in 2018 and in 2019, you know, they just,  I don't have their names and names and figures off the top of my head.  I remember where they were, but I, I re I've been studying the weather pattern and it's  
**[0:19:20-0:19:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:19:20):**  the same thing.  You know, we'll get that red flag warning day two or three days in advance.  The national weather service has come fantastic about being able to get these red flag warnings  
**[0:19:28-0:19:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:19:28):**  out many days in advance in the last five years, they've just done come so far and being  able to get the warning out, you know, when there's a red flag warning day.  So it wasn't quite that quick in 2016.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:19:40):**  Now I think they almost give us an extra day, almost 36 hours, some more warning than they  did five years ago.  So it's, it's kind of improved that much.  
**[0:19:48-0:20:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:19:48):**  And that does help you with the fire management context.  So you know, we had that really strong 25 mile an hour south wind that was hot and dry.  And then we had the cold front come through that had no moisture behind it.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:20:02):**  And that it didn't drop the temperature very much about 15 degrees.  But what it did is it made the wind switch from the south at 20 to the northwest at 40  to 45.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:20:12):**  And it doesn't matter how bad ass of a firefighter you think you might be, you are not going  to chase down and actively attack a grass fire burning in four to 6000 pounds of dry  fine fuel that's being pushed by 40 to 45 miles an hour wind.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:20:31):**  Sorry, buddy, you ain't doing it.  So the fire started way down in Oklahoma, and it was Tuesday afternoon.  And I remember, I mean, I had such kind of a clear memory of that almost few days.  
**[0:20:45-0:20:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:20:45):**  I remember it.  I remember it starting.  I mean, I kind of remember that day, you know, the things leading up to that day and knowing  
**[0:20:52-0:21:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:20:52):**  that the weather is going to be bad.  And that Tuesday morning, Vanershein Creek, I had I just had a feeling of dread.  I mean, just the wind and the humidity and the heat.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:21:01):**  And I just had a feeling.  I just had a feeling.  And my ranches is fairly high, like in elevation.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:21:09):**  Okay, yeah, we're talking about Kansas.  It's flat compared to what most people are used to.  But I do have 30% incline on my hills that are 200 feet high.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:21:19):**  So I've got stuff that's just as steep as a lot of stuff out in Colorado in the mountains.  It's just not as big and we live on top of it.  We don't live down in the valleys because the valleys are too small.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:21:28):**  So my ranch is kind of up on top.  And I can see long ways to the west, I can see a long ways to the south, long ways to  the north and a long ways to the east.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:21:38):**  And I've trained myself over the years on days like that you keep you keep an eye up  wind.  You know, and all of us, you know, there's several of us out here that you know, on days  
**[0:21:47-0:22:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:21:47):**  like that we kind of, you know, we don't go hide in the house like we normally would.  We get out, we stay with the radios, we keep our phones charged and you keep your eyes,  you keep your eyes upwind and you keep your nose working and make sure you're not smelling  
**[0:22:00-0:22:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:22:00):**  anything weird.  Because in 40 miles an hour wind, you don't see a smoke column, you might not see the  smoke column until you are short, short minutes away from having a head fire on top of you.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:22:13):**  So hang on, let me let me jump in here.  So this is one of the things I've been asking people from out of state.  So here in Montana, you know, you can kind of divide Montana as far as western Montana,  
**[0:22:26-0:22:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:22:26):**  eastern Montana, everything east of the divide is pretty much eastern Montana.  For all intents and purposes, we got open, open prairie, badlands, break lands, everything  Island Mountain ranges, you name it.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:22:39):**  Also in eastern Montana, it's fairly common where on farms and ranches, people either  a have their own private firefighting equipment, either on ATV, UTV on the trucks.  Also there is like a co-op program with Montana DNRC where they kind of have fire engines  
**[0:22:56-0:23:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:22:56):**  that they'll strategically place in rural counties because there isn't a paid fire response.  So how about for context, like what you guys have in Kansas?  Okay, unified response and command in 2016 was non-existent.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:23:12):**  And that was my, that was my sole biggest critique.  Like that's my biggest, that was my biggest issue with how that fire was managed was there  was no overall command and control.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:23:27):**  There was very little coordination between units.  Getting enough help fast enough was a problem.  And I'll admit they didn't learn all the lessons they needed to before Starbucks happened a  
**[0:23:39-0:23:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:23:39):**  year, like less than a year later.  I mean, after Anderson Creek, you know, a lot of people were thinking, Oh, wow, I hope  that never happens again.  
**[0:23:48-0:23:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:23:48):**  I hope that never happens again.  That was a once in 100 year thing.  That was a once in 100 year thing.  
**[0:23:53-0:24:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:23:53):**  And myself and a few others are going, no guys, no, no.  That just means we're out of the woods for a little while.  Look around.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:24:00):**  This will happen again.  It might be five years.  It might be 10 years, but we will see another mega fire like that.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:24:06):**  You know, there are a lot of doubters that said it wouldn't happen again.  I was one of the few that said that it was going to, I had no idea it would be less than  a year that, that we would almost double the size of the Anderson Creek fire.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:24:19):**  So I want to take this opportunity since I did say that overall command and coordination  was a little bit lacking in 2016.  And I don't want that to be any disrespect all to Barbara County Fire Department.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:24:35):**  Because at the time, I was really, really critical of them.  But now looking back, they did some things that they that they'd never done before.  They used drip torches off a highway at about midnight, one o'clock in the morning, and  
**[0:24:49-0:25:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:24:49):**  they lit a backfire and they stopped the head fire at the highway.  And they held it for eight and a half hours.  And that eight and a half hours probably saved, it probably cut the fire down.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:25:02):**  It probably it could have cut the fire from from over 700,000 to what it was, because  I know what's on the other side of where they stopped it.  And I know where it would have gone to by the next morning, when the wind started to

**[0:25:23-0:25:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:25:23):**  Like that's it.  You did a good job that day.  You and your boys did a good thing with that backfire.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:25:29):**  So they deserve that shout out.  So where was I?  I was with my buddy Ed.  
**[0:25:34-0:25:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:25:34):**  And we were both trying to keep each other calm.  We were setting up on a hill where we spent some time driving around before the sun went  down, down south scouting around just after it crossed the state line.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:25:44):**  You know, as I had fire radios with me, I guess let me back up a little bit more.  So I'd said all day that Tuesday, I'd kind of had a sense of drip.  And I went home at five.  
**[0:25:54-0:26:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:25:54):**  I left the ranch at five and five.  There wasn't, I didn't see any smoke.  I mean, yeah, there was a little bit of haze in the sky.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:26:02):**  I didn't see a smoke column.  I didn't smell anything.  The fire radios had been quiet all day.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:26:08):**  And I thought five o'clock, we're close to the break point.  Okay, that break point in the day where you can you can almost feel it where the humidity  and temperature curve breaks over and starts to drop and then your wildfire danger starts  
**[0:26:23-0:26:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:26:23):**  to drop.  I knew that I knew the humidity wasn't going to come up that much, but it was going to  come up enough to help.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:26:28):**  And the wind was going to come down and the temperature was going to come down.  So wildfire, you know, so so spreading index, I guess is what risk of spread would be would  be kind of maybe the more technical way.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:26:40):**  So that risk was starting to decrease, obviously, once you reach that turning point.  So I checked out when I was rolling through Sun City, which is a mile away from my house,  I stopped my talk to my friend Tim, who lived catty corner from the firehouse.  
**[0:26:53-0:27:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:26:53):**  And we stopped right there on the street in front of his house.  I don't think it's Main Street, but it's like the street that meets Main Street in the center  of town.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:27:00):**  Like, I just stopped there.  We had a 10 minute conversation about the day the weather.  Thank God we hadn't had a fire went home.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:27:07):**  15 minutes later, the pagers went there called for mutual aid to Oklahoma and I'm thinking,  okay, Oklahoma is a long way off.  They'll have some time to get it shut down.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:27:16):**  You know, they'll chase it, you know, chase around into some canyons and they can, you  know, maybe they'll get it shut down.  If not, maybe they can find a defense on the state line.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:27:24):**  Well, when I got the when I got the phone call that it was within four miles of the  state line and running hard.  That's when that's when I jumped in the truck with my with my best buddy Ed.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:27:36):**  And we went south to check out the situation.  And we got down there and it had already blown over the highway or had already blown over  the county or the state line.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:27:45):**  There's a road down there.  They local fire departments, all the rural fire departments, and everybody that was there  with mutual aid with assistance from some local landowners, members of our burn association.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:27:59):**  They almost almost pinched it off between a green crop field and a burn that had been  conducted several days prior.  They came within 100 yards of having it and they lost it there.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:28:12):**  So when I knew that they had when I knew that they had that loss, said Ed, let's go back  up to Estill Road.  Said why?  
**[0:28:18-0:28:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:28:18):**  I said because that's the next place that they have any chance of holding this thing.  That's the next road north.  I said, you know what, you know what's past that?  
**[0:28:24-0:28:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:28:24):**  And he goes, no fucking highway is my language.  So by the time we got to Estill Road, we were there for a while and Comanche County, which  is the county east or west of me, they were they were responding in full force and Comanche  
**[0:28:38-0:28:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:28:38):**  County fire.  Those guys are on top of their game.  Clark County fire.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:28:42):**  Those guys are some of the best.  And they I mean, they were having they were having fairly successful luck, you know, trying  to pinch the flanks and trying to pinch the flanks.  
**[0:28:51-0:28:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:28:51):**  They didn't hold Estill Road at all.  There was no hope of holding Estill Road.  And I saw it on.  
**[0:28:57-0:29:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:28:57):**  I saw it.  And when that happened, Barbara County was still on their way up.  They were trying to regroup and they were still they were still trying to get in back  
**[0:29:07-0:29:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:29:07):**  in front of it.  And I heard Rick come on the radio and I said, you know, can we stop it at Estill Road?  And I got back on the radio said, Rick, this Brian, no, it's already past Estill Road,  
**[0:29:16-0:29:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:29:16):**  you better go to the highway and you better make a plan.  And you better go right now without delay, because if you don't, it'll be there.  It's going to be there at midnight.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:29:23):**  And that was like an hour and 20 or 30 minutes.  And like I said, I got to give him credit.  He got there and he got his boys organized.  
**[0:29:30-0:29:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:29:30):**  They got a drip torch and they stopped that head fire for eight hours.  And that was that was the best thing they could have done.  So you're asking about equipment, I think was what your question actually was.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:29:41):**  So our rural fire equipment has gotten a lot better in the last five years.  I know, obviously, there's more awareness of wildfire.  And there's been, you know, the federal government has has blessed us with some of our money  
**[0:29:56-0:30:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:29:56):**  back to buy better fire equipment, which is kind of nice.  So we do have some upgraded fire equipment.  Things have worked better at the state level.  
**[0:30:06-0:30:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:30:06):**  There's new there's new cooperation agreements.  I forget what it's called.  But there are cooperation agreements now in place between local rule of fire and Kansas  
**[0:30:17-0:30:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:30:17):**  Forest Service and any any large event since 2018 is when is when they implemented all  those systems.  Excuse me, the large fires we've had since 2018 have had a much better, much more coordinated  
**[0:30:32-0:30:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:30:32):**  response, much, much faster.  They've also started pre positioning units.  And Oklahoma.  
**[0:30:41-0:30:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:30:41):**  It's so funny, like lines on a map are so funny, like Oklahoma does things so different.  And for a long time, you know, like, Oklahoma couldn't officially come help us unless they  were asked a certain way.  
**[0:30:55-0:31:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:30:55):**  But it never mattered.  I mean, if they need our help, if somebody calls you go, you know, red flag day 40 mile  an hour when there's a fire in the world, and your phone rings, you go, that's it.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:31:07):**  You go and do whatever you can to help the people that are there.  I mean, even if it's just maybe scouting and going to watch in a flank or watching a corner,  going watching a road crossing, telling people don't drive into smoke, you know, don't go  
**[0:31:17-0:31:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:31:17):**  be a looky loo, though.  You know, if you're just going to go look, stay home, don't get in anybody's way.  People have a job to do.  
**[0:31:24-0:31:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:31:24):**  They're focused, stay out of their way.  So back to equipment.  Man, I remember some of the shady stuff that that we all used to use back in the 80s.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:31:35):**  Oh, wow.  And you know, the and you know, there's still some people that show up at a fire with some  stuff I look at and just go, you are a backup unit for a backup unit for a backup unit.  
**[0:31:49-0:31:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:31:49):**  I am not putting you on the front line.  I'm sorry.  But we have, you know, a lot of us have pretty decent equipment, and we're getting better  
**[0:31:57-0:32:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:31:57):**  every year.  There's a there's an equipment donation program that that our burner Association takes part  in from Kansas Forest Service.  
**[0:32:06-0:32:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:32:06):**  So we've gotten to Stewart and Stevenson deuce and a half trucks like they just provide the  truck, they retain ownership over it, you have to buy insurance, put the tires on it,  whatever and maintain it.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:32:17):**  And you got to put all your plumbing and your your tanks and whatnot and your radios in  it.  And the most important thing is radios like that is the number one thing a prescribed  
**[0:32:27-0:32:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:32:27):**  fire association needs is radio, radios, radios, radios, lots and lots of good radios, and  learn how to use them and learn how to use them effectively as a team as a.  So I love that you hit on that because it just hits back on the lcs, you know, see communications,  
**[0:32:44-0:32:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:32:44):**  that's the big thing, you know that.  That's one of the stories I have heard from a lot of people that communications is that  is the breakdown point.  
**[0:32:53-0:33:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:32:53):**  A lot of times, like things could have gone so much differently if communications were  better and whether that's equipment, radio, whether that's actual personnel agency stuff.  There's times where it's like just having two units 100 yards down the line can make  
**[0:33:11-0:33:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:33:11):**  or break a day, you know, just one person being out of position, well, one, one member  of your team, not knowing the plan and not knowing fully what's going on and what to  expect.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:33:21):**  It's going to ruin your whole day.  And I imagine that probably during Creek, because I heard stories from other folks in  eastern Montana that, you know, because you do have so many different responses, you've  
**[0:33:34-0:33:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:33:34):**  got folks that have their own type six engines that are responding, you've got co ops, you've  got counties, you got state federal agencies sometimes coming in.  One of the things I'd heard about the breakdowns and communication was you'd have local resources  
**[0:33:48-0:33:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:33:48):**  addressing a flank or even the head somewhere.  But because they didn't have the frequency that everybody else did, nobody knew they  were there.  
**[0:33:57-0:34:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:33:57):**  And so there'd be situations where say another entity on some other part would decide this  is where we can catch it on this road, let's do a back burn.  And lo and behold, you've got x number of engines and personnel in between the main  
**[0:34:11-0:34:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:34:11):**  fire front the road and where they're doing the back burn.  You got 20 rigs and 50 guys up trying to do a back burn.  And then you got another 20 rigs and 50 guys trying to anchor a flank that's useless if  
**[0:34:24-0:34:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:34:24):**  your back fireworks.  And they don't know.  And they don't know, you know, command and control communication.  
**[0:34:30-0:34:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:34:30):**  And you know, there's no easy answer, I don't think but things have gotten so much better  in that realm in the last five years.  And you know, there's a red flag warning, not far from here today, like we're borderline  
**[0:34:48-0:34:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:34:48):**  tomorrow may be a red flag, they haven't decided yet.  Like, we're right there.  I mean, we're critical fire weather.  
**[0:34:54-0:35:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:34:54):**  So you know, it's not on silent.  It's here, it's, it's waiting and it's getting close to that time.  I mean, you know, two o'clock is is when that that danger starts to rise rapidly.  
**[0:35:06-0:35:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:35:06):**  So you know, with the communication aspect of it, you know, from from a wildfire context,  you know, there's, I think that there's a lot of, you know, trained professional fire  managers that look down on private landowner, fire practitioners as as being untrained and  
**[0:35:24-0:35:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:35:24):**  unskilled.  I don't have a red card.  I've never been through the 102, 103 training, I don't have any desire to go through any  
**[0:35:30-0:35:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:35:30):**  of that crap.  I've been lighting things on fire in my environment for 35 years.  Do I consider myself an expert in my environment?  
**[0:35:38-0:35:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:35:38):**  Yes.  Within my little, you know, within my little narrow realm of the red hills, you know, I  would I would consider myself a fire expert, take me to California, I'll still know a lot,  
**[0:35:48-0:35:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:35:48):**  and I'll still be able to give some good advice.  But that's not my that's not my context, right.  So we have to keep in mind that, you know, all things in contact.  
**[0:35:58-0:36:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:35:58):**  And the point I was making was, you know, we need fire, like federal and state fire  managers, government fire managers need to do a better job of involving these local burn  groups that are organized that know how to communicate and work together.  
**[0:36:15-0:36:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:36:15):**  Okay, burn managers, go find those groups, go find those people and help support them,  organize them, you can we have we had offered our services as a burn group to the Kansas  Forest Service, as a mobile task force, that's a command unit to attack trucks, and embedded  
**[0:36:33-0:36:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:36:33):**  tanker support.  I mean, it's it's a minimum for unit self contained task force, we can show up only  the only one person has to talk to KFS.  
**[0:36:43-0:36:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:36:43):**  They say you're assigned to zone j do this task.  We're on it, we can do that, that that agreement hasn't been formalized yet.  And they haven't utilized our services.  
**[0:36:53-0:37:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:36:53):**  That there, there were a couple days last year that we were sitting on rigs ready to  go.  We're waiting for a call.  
**[0:37:00-0:37:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:37:00):**  So there's a lot there's cooperation communication.  That's I think that's what's key.  So lessons learned from the Anderson Creek wildfire.  
**[0:37:10-0:37:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:37:10):**  This is where the good part starts, right.  So you know, I watched that fire burn up my whole ranch.  I stayed out with Ed all night till I think I think we I think he dropped me off around  
**[0:37:23-0:37:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:37:23):**  two o'clock in the morning.  And that was after after the backfire was successful, and they'd stopped the width of  the head fire.  
**[0:37:31-0:37:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:37:31):**  And all they had to do is was keep tying flanks and keep tying flanks and anchor flanks.  And it kind of started to dawn on me that night, like, wait a minute, in the next 12  hour and 12 hours, the wind is going to be out of the north out of the west to northwest  
**[0:37:46-0:38:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:37:46):**  at 30 to 40 miles an hour.  What's going to happen when that happened?  Is it possible to put enough trucks in that rough country to tie down 25 plus miles of  
**[0:38:00-0:38:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:38:00):**  what what would be the right flank the east flank before that wind switch and turns that  whole east flank into a head fire?  I knew that was going to happen.  
**[0:38:09-0:38:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:38:09):**  I knew there was no way that they were going to tie that whole flank down.  There was there aren't enough resources that could get to the area fast enough to be able  to tie that flank down before the wind would switch and turn it into a head fire.  
**[0:38:23-0:38:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:38:23):**  It was basically inevitable.  The only thing the only thing they had any effect on was stopping the northern spread.  And they did a great job of that.  
**[0:38:32-0:38:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:38:32):**  I mean, if they hadn't if they hadn't stopped it where they would have stopped it, Domo,  it would have gone another 20 to 25 miles north before the wind switched.  And then when the wind switched, they would have had that much more ground to cover there.  
**[0:38:44-0:38:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:38:44):**  In that area, north, north of where they stopped it, there's more people that live up there.  It's a little rougher.  And it leads almost straight to the town of Medicine Lodge that's home to 2000 people.  
**[0:38:55-0:39:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:38:55):**  And there was a way there was a way in for the fire.  Like there was a way in for it to get there.  It didn't partially because Barbara County Fire stopped it at Tuesday night, Wednesday  
**[0:39:05-0:39:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:39:05):**  morning at Highway 160.  That's what saved Medicine Lodge, not anything else.  So talking about lessons learned, you know, a lot of lessons learned communication.  
**[0:39:14-0:39:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:39:14):**  So what were the lessons we learned ecologically on a large scale?  Okay, so I've got a long history of fire.  And I've had some great successes in in cleaning up invasive species with fire and cleaning  
**[0:39:28-0:39:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:39:28):**  up, you know, small areas, there have been a lot of areas that, you know, a lot of types  of areas like, you know, really steep canyons that are just totally infested with trees  that we've never been successful getting to burn under prescribed burn conditions.  
**[0:39:43-0:39:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:39:43):**  Well, when it's a red flag day, and you got 40 miles an hour when watch out buddy, because  95% of your woody mass is going to burn.  And it did.  
**[0:39:53-0:40:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:39:53):**  And entire canyons were cleaned out.  And it was just amazing.  So leading up to this, we'd experienced a couple other wildfires, which I haven't even  
**[0:40:01-0:40:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:40:01):**  talked about.  There was one in 2008.  There's one in 2014.  
**[0:40:04-0:40:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:40:04):**  The one in 2008 burned up the middle 55 50 to 55% of the ranch just right up the middle  and that was awesome.  And if hadn't been for that, and learning how to rebuild fence after that, like 2016  
**[0:40:18-0:40:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:40:18):**  was really rough.  But some of the things I saw after 2008, okay, it was kind of another one of those red flag  fire days.  
**[0:40:25-0:40:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:40:25):**  It cleaned out a canyon, it cleaned out a couple canyons full of cedar trees.  Well, funny thing happens when you do that.  Out here on this ranch, you start finding a creek and, and the longer you keep what  
**[0:40:37-0:40:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:40:37):**  we found since then is if you can go in with with some kind of horsepower, because I can't  run enough stock density of bison, build a trample dead cedar trees.  So I've got to replicate that impact with a masticator or a mulcher.  
**[0:40:52-0:41:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:40:52):**  So spent a lot of time with a skid steer mounted mulcher mulching trees.  I spent 850 hours in a least excavator with a mulcher head on it in two years.  And that's all I did for two years was sit in that excavator and grind up tree.  
**[0:41:06-0:41:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:41:06):**  So, creating habitat restoring native habitat.  Okay, now I'm not saying cedars aren't native, they're native to the red hills, historic,  you know, history supports that anecdotal history supports that 100%.  
**[0:41:20-0:41:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:41:20):**  But they're infesting the grasslands because we have removed fire from the equation.  And the rate of the rate of conversion, it's scary.  And the amount of money that is being spent on on preventative methods, my friend direct  
**[0:41:36-0:41:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:41:36):**  twidwell at University of Nebraska, Lincoln, I'd be happy to hook you up with his with  his contact information or make an introduction.  He's working with something called the range land analysis platform, or AP, and he is studying  
**[0:41:51-0:42:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:41:51):**  the effects of biome conversion, fire on the landscape, and ways to stop encroachment of  woody plants into the grassland biome.  And I hate to say this, it's kind of sound like bragging.  
**[0:42:07-0:42:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:42:07):**  But there's a he's directs been here several times.  In fact, he was just here a couple weeks ago for a burn associations annual meeting, and  he gave a presentation gave a great presentation about some of the updates to wrap and the  
**[0:42:18-0:42:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:42:18):**  new things that they've learned since he gave his first presentation to us a little over  a year ago, which kind of just blew me away.  So they're, they're charting, they can see the effects between Caitlin backup.  
**[0:42:31-0:42:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:42:31):**  So what what range land analysis platform will show you the data you can get from it,  you can get a year by year progression, and some of the information is at different scales,  but it's all at all at a relevant scale.  
**[0:42:43-0:42:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:42:43):**  Okay, some of it's even, you know, like, maybe a two or three kilometer block, whatever,  but it's still a relevant scale to show you long term change over over on a large scale,  right?  
**[0:42:53-0:43:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:42:53):**  You know, it's not going to give me a lot of useful information, tell me where I need  to go exactly cut trees on my ranch.  Okay, but the data that it does drive, okay.  
**[0:43:00-0:43:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:43:00):**  So it's going to show you it can, it knows the difference between, you know, Woody herbaceous,  sagebrush, a farm field, a corn crop, and native range land.  And it has biomass estimates now for all of these categories.  
**[0:43:14-0:43:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:43:14):**  Okay, so now people got to, you know, don't get hung up on biomass as, as you know, your  benchmark to be shooting for tons of biomass per acre, because that's wrong.  You know, it's the carbon sequestration potential of that biomass per acre that we need to think  
**[0:43:29-0:43:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:43:29):**  about in that context.  Okay.  So what the data is showing is the eastern red cedar trees and junipers, Virginia is  
**[0:43:37-0:43:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:43:37):**  basically converting the entire grasslands biome at a rapidly accelerating rate.  It's almost a geometric progression, you know, skateboard ramp that you wouldn't, you wouldn't  want to ride a bicycle down.  
**[0:43:49-0:44:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:43:49):**  And but the important lesson that he's learning, okay, is they're showing that these two big  wild that Anderson Creek wildfire is is the, the example he likes to use when he comes  down and talks to us and tells us that, you know, we're his best example of, you know,  
**[0:44:04-0:44:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:44:04):**  prescribed burn association, leveraging a wildfire to have a core, blah, blah, blah,  blah.  I'm sure he says the same thing when he goes to Nebraska, and he talks about the less Canyon  
**[0:44:14-0:44:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:44:14):**  range land alliance, because they had a similar wildfire up there that burn that burned out  a lot of their members ranches.  And that was also a wake up call for them like, hey, we got this big area cleaned up  
**[0:44:25-0:44:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:44:25):**  now that we can defend.  Okay, we have a core.  And then we're also looking at several of these coercion in the red hills.  
**[0:44:32-0:44:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:44:32):**  Now let me explain what a core is.  So part of dark part of a direct research, the IRAC just says just nobody's confused  direct.  
**[0:44:42-0:44:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:44:42):**  And that's how he says his name.  I will I didn't give it to him.  He says, wow, that was a bad rabbit trying to say, well, I forgot what what what how  
**[0:44:50-0:45:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:44:50):**  I was gonna quote him.  He's he's about ready to put a number like on the cost to the ecosystem to do nothing.  So he talks about cores.  
**[0:45:03-0:45:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:45:03):**  Okay, I got it back on track.  Okay, so one of the one of the crucial things that direct has uncovered in his research  is that the birds that like to eat cedar berries, they generally pass those seeds in seven minutes  
**[0:45:17-0:45:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:45:17):**  or less, which means that's 200 yards, 200 yards from the seed sources, all you got to  defend.  I had a light bulb moment the first time I heard that.  
**[0:45:26-0:45:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:45:26):**  That means I don't have to go down and saw every tree in the canyon.  I just have to go down and saw out the big females that have all the berries on them  and saw down every tree that has berries on them.  
**[0:45:36-0:45:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:45:36):**  And the good news is, cedar trees are very sexually dimorphic.  Okay, it's like one in 10 to one in seven emails to males.  I mean, so the males have their choice, right?  
**[0:45:47-0:45:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:45:47):**  I mean, females can be picky.  But that's good news for us as land managers, because that's less of those trees that we  have to get rid of to reduce the seed store.  
**[0:45:56-0:46:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:45:56):**  So I guess what I'm saying is, if you like your cedar trees, you can keep your cedar  trees, just not the female.  That's a very strategic way to go about it.  
**[0:46:06-0:46:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:46:06):**  There's a whole strategic plan.  I mean, and Dirac says that, you know, we need to have, well, he didn't say this, I'm  saying it for him.  
**[0:46:15-0:46:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:46:15):**  We need to have a holistic fire management context for biomes.  Okay, the grasslands don't stop at the state line between Kansas and Texas.  They don't stop at the state line between Kansas and Colorado.  
**[0:46:30-0:46:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:46:30):**  The grasslands should be managed as grasslands.  Great Plains biome should have a holistic fire management, holistic fire management  context, that's applicable to everybody in that Great Plains biome that we all buy into.  
**[0:46:46-0:46:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:46:46):**  That is, we need fire to manage our landscape.  We have to use fire to reduce these invasive trees.  Okay, so I want to bounce back to this concept of a core.  
**[0:46:57-0:47:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:46:57):**  Okay, and the two examples that Dirac likes to use, like I said, are Anderson Creek Wildfire  and Jip Hills Prescribe Burn Association, and then the West Canyon Rangeland Alliance,  LCRA.  
**[0:47:09-0:47:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:47:09):**  Hope that's right.  If I'm not, send me some hate mail.  So these cores is basically a large area that you've established and you have maintained  
**[0:47:17-0:47:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:47:17):**  free from infestation, you've removed the seed source from.  So that's a reclamation burn and then a follow-up maintenance burn, and then you can just get,  or I guess a reclamation burn and then a restoration burn.  
**[0:47:30-0:47:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:47:30):**  And then finally you get to that maintenance burning phase.  So your restoration burn, and you want that to be as big, hot, and intense as possible  because you want to get as many of those big mature trees that you're not going to have  
**[0:47:42-0:47:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:47:42):**  another chance to get unless you get an Anderson Creek.  You don't get a second chance if you do it right to go down in there and get those big  ones.  
**[0:47:52-0:48:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:47:52):**  If you've got some small ones scattered up on your hills and ridge tops, maybe go clip  those suckers and throw them down the canyons as ladder fuel to get the big ones to go and  then run a big hot fire down there.  
**[0:48:01-0:48:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:48:01):**  You'll just love it because there'll be a creek down there and all kinds of habitat.  So a core area is a core that's been burned out and possibly even mechanically treated  to remove all of the seed source.  
**[0:48:12-0:48:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:48:12):**  And once you have that core established, you can walk away from the middle of it.  And all you have to do is defend the edges, 200 yards.  Then it becomes, when you start thinking about the problem like that, when you start thinking  
**[0:48:22-0:48:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:48:22):**  about the grasslands biome, okay, and I'm going to like, I'm just quoting Drack all  over the place, but he has some really great analogies about this.  He says, right now what we're doing is sending ambulances all over the place and trying to  
**[0:48:34-0:48:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:48:34):**  do emergency care.  And it's not effective.  I mean, we're just burning through money.  
**[0:48:39-0:48:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:48:39):**  I think Texas and Oklahoma spent $261 million in 2019 and they accomplished nothing.  Like, I mean, long term, they didn't really do anything with that money to stop encroaching  on a woody brush.  
**[0:48:54-0:49:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:48:54):**  I had no idea how brushy it was driving down through Texas, like how bad it had gotten.  Like it is, it's ridiculous how bad it's gotten like straight south of me down through Texas  all the way down to, oh, Kingsville, I forget where all we've been.  
**[0:49:10-0:49:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:49:10):**  We went all the way to South Padre.  So I mean, from South Padre to South Central Kansas, we drove that whole route.  And it's like, I mean, there's just trees everywhere.

**[0:49:21-0:49:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:49:21):**  And when Lewis and Clark came through here, 205 years ago or whatever it was, 215 years  ago, well, they didn't come through here, but you know, they went up around North Dakota,  you know, they're talking about North Dakota, you know, driving, riding through the grasslands  
**[0:49:34-0:49:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:49:34):**  and the grass was so tall, they could tie it in a knot over their horses back.  Okay, so maybe they had really short ponies.  And maybe it was a really good year for grass.  
**[0:49:46-0:49:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:49:46):**  But you know, even if you're on, you know, even if you're on a short pony, 78 foot tall  grass is still really impressive.  And Lewis and Clark aren't the only ones we hear that from.  
**[0:49:55-0:50:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:49:55):**  You know, those accounts are repeated anecdotally in almost countless journals from trappers,  from early settlers and early explorers.  And then what do we do?  
**[0:50:05-0:50:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:50:05):**  We shut all the, you know, we ran the indigenous people off.  The reason the Great Plains were settled last in America is because of the Comanche Indian.  Did you know that?  
**[0:50:16-0:50:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:50:16):**  No.  Like all the settlers, you know, the original westward expansion phase, I mean, there was  a reason why nobody stopped here, because it was territory of the Comanches, the horse  
**[0:50:25-0:50:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:50:25):**  lords of the plains, and they really didn't like whitey's.  As long as the whitey's went west over the mountains, they didn't care.  And as long as they stayed east in the trees, they didn't care.  
**[0:50:36-0:50:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:50:36):**  They were the horse lords of the plains.  I mean, there was a big west.  I'm getting a lot of this.  
**[0:50:41-0:50:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:50:41):**  And I hope I'm, and I'm hoping to remember it right.  This is coming out of Empire Comanche Moon, which is a fantastic book.  No, Empire of the Summer Moon.  
**[0:50:50-0:50:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:50:50):**  Empire of the Summer Moon.  Great book.  Wish I could remember the guy that the author's name right now, but it escapes me.  
**[0:50:55-0:51:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:50:55):**  Anyway, moving on.  So I'm in probably what would be the extreme eastern edge, maybe even the northeast corner  of the Comancheria.  
**[0:51:04-0:51:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:51:04):**  And we couldn't fight him fairly.  You know, the cavalry couldn't fight him fairly.  The Colt pistol was invented, the Dragoon pistol was invented because the Texas Rangers  
**[0:51:14-0:51:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:51:14):**  needed a better weapon to fight the Comanche.  Like Blackjack wrote a letter to Colt and said, we need something that can do this,  this and this and this, and then Colt sent him a prototype a couple months later.  
**[0:51:24-0:51:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:51:24):**  So that's why the revolver was invented.  I digress.  So the plains were only really settled after we beat the Comanches or after the Comanches  
**[0:51:34-0:51:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:51:34):**  were defeated.  And the Comanches had such a strong grip and such a strong understanding of how the plains  ecosystem worked and how to navigate this country quickly and effectively.  
**[0:51:49-0:51:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:51:49):**  I mean, they deserve to own it.  It was theirs.  They did a good, I'm not saying they did a good job.  
**[0:51:55-0:52:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:51:55):**  I'm not saying that the Comanche necessarily were good indigenous managers.  I have no evidence to support or refute that.  And I don't really want to go down your rabbit trails talking about indigenous use of fire.  
**[0:52:08-0:52:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:52:08):**  I've seen some evidence to support it, some to refute it.  I've seen evidence, there's a natural fire return frequency of seven to 10 years in a  historical context.  
**[0:52:16-0:52:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:52:16):**  You can argue about that till the cows come home.  I think the moral of the story is wildfire is a fact of life in almost every context  in our country.  
**[0:52:27-0:52:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:52:27):**  And we need to be much more fire adapted, not just with our homesteads, our buildings,  our infrastructure.  We need to understand that fire is a natural part of the landscape.  
**[0:52:39-0:52:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:52:39):**  And sometimes we just need to let the whole dang forest burn down because that's death.  That's a cycle.  It's renewal.  
**[0:52:46-0:52:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:52:46):**  It's regeneration.  The strong plants will survive and old dead decaying things that are just taking up space.  You need renewal.  
**[0:52:56-0:53:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:52:56):**  And back to fire as a management tool.  So fire is, I'm in more of the maintenance phase on my property.  Yeah, I've got areas that I've got to worry about.  
**[0:53:07-0:53:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:53:07):**  I don't have my good core defense real tight.  I got areas I got to worry about.  Hopefully I've got a two year plan to have my core defense tight and all I got to worry  
**[0:53:15-0:53:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:53:15):**  about is my fence lines after that and then get my neighbors to go burn.  Man, I lost my train of thought again.  Terrible about that.  
**[0:53:22-0:53:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:53:22):**  Terrible about that this morning.  And I'm not meaning to interrupt you or redirect you or distract you, but I just want to say  I do love that you recognize and voice that change.  
**[0:53:33-0:53:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:53:33):**  It's inevitable.  Things are always changing and that really if things are staying the same, it's because  humans have interfered and tried to preserve it in a certain way.  
**[0:53:45-0:53:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:53:45):**  But when you study the natural world and you're looking at the natural cycles, how things  work without any human interference, it's constantly changing.  It's always in some stage of succession or progression.  
**[0:53:56-0:54:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:53:56):**  There'll be some kind of change, whether that's natural now or human caused, but it changes  and then it starts over again.  And we're really the only ones that are like, we want to keep it in one way or the other.  
**[0:54:08-0:54:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:54:08):**  And I think that's one of the things I've noticed is when people are talking about how  they're managing their property, you either have that view set that, nope, we want to  stay one way, or you're willing to roll with natural processes and natural cycles and not  
**[0:54:21-0:54:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:54:21):**  fight the things that aren't worth fighting.  I think that's a fundamental shift in minds.  We have to learn to live with nature.  
**[0:54:30-0:54:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:54:30):**  We have to change our mindset.  We have to get out of this head space of ownership and get into a head space of being privileged  enough to be the steward of this wonderful, beautiful resource that we have called earth.  
**[0:54:48-0:54:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:54:48):**  Hopefully we can have this big massive cultural shift towards that.  Excuse me.  Yeah.  
**[0:54:55-0:55:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:54:55):**  How about here's a question.  I told them this did distract you from the rabbit trail we were going down, but if you  were to describe-  
**[0:55:03-0:55:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:55:03):**  I don't even remember what the rabbit looked like right now.  If you were to describe or try to define sustainability, how would you, or what does it mean to you?  Sustainability means we're going to stay in the same screwed up state that we're currently  
**[0:55:16-0:55:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:55:16):**  in.  It's not good enough.  I mean, that's what it means to me.  
**[0:55:20-0:55:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:55:20):**  And you know that there's just levels and levels of levels of context to keep unpacking  there to explain that in a holistic vision.  But I guess that's just how I think about things.  
**[0:55:33-0:55:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:55:33):**  Very interesting.  And I'll get you back on track.  I promise.  
**[0:55:37-0:55:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:55:37):**  Yeah, that's one of the other questions I've been asking people because some people, how  people share their wildfire stories, it seems like there's either one camp that says this  was the absolute worst thing that could have happened every way, shape, and form to my  
**[0:55:54-0:56:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:55:54):**  ranch, to my business, to my family, everything.  And then there's another division that says this was absolutely the best thing that ever  happened.  
**[0:56:02-0:56:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:56:02):**  And now I'm changing my practices and doing XX and X because of this.  And so like you're talking about kind of like those core areas on your ranch.  There was another rancher that I toured his ranch.  
**[0:56:14-0:56:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:56:14):**  It was north of Billings, Montana, kind of in between Billings and Roundup.  And that's exactly what happened to him.  He had an early spring fire on his place.  
**[0:56:22-0:56:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:56:22):**  They had been getting out of the cattle business.  The timber that was on their property was caused, the cattle were consuming the needles,  which caused huge abortion rates in his herd.  
**[0:56:33-0:56:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:56:33):**  Pine needle abortions.  We've heard about that before on episode one with Hobbs Maggare.  Yes.  
**[0:56:38-0:56:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:56:38):**  And so after their fire wiped out their timber, he said it was the best thing that ever happened.  All of a sudden they had a winter range, which they hadn't before.  The trees were gone.  
**[0:56:50-0:57:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:56:50):**  They lost that abortion percentage because the trees were gone and not causing that problem  anymore.  And it was a huge mindset shift of all of a sudden they began aggressive mechanical  
**[0:57:00-0:57:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:57:00):**  treatments on their property.  They started creating both firebreaks and kind of what their, one of their tactics for,  because they also incorporated prescribed burning in addition to mechanical treatment,  
**[0:57:11-0:57:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:57:11):**  was they would take, say the trees, the juniper, the brush, everything from those firebreaks  they were creating, and they'd bring it to a timbered area on the ranch and create this  big pile with the whole intent that when they did prescribe burning through that area, that  
**[0:57:27-0:57:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:57:27):**  when that pile caught on fire, it would cause that, that ladder fuel effect.  And it would wipe out and punch out holes in the timber that they might've not gotten  otherwise by just trying to do prescribed burning, burning through the understory.  
**[0:57:40-0:57:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:57:40):**  They achieved that, that huge, you know, punching a hole that they wanted to get.  And so I think when you can punch a hole and crown out a canyon, it's, it's terrifying  to see when it's a wildfire context, but when it's, when it's in the right situation, it's  
**[0:57:58-0:58:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:57:58):**  a beautiful, beautiful thing to just sit back.  So what lessons learned, did you have, did you have more totally distracting?  Sorry.  
**[0:58:08-0:58:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:58:08):**  Oh, we're, we're still on the lessons learned question.  Wow.  We get much more to cover.  
**[0:58:14-0:58:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:58:14):**  Or we can totally divert and we can go into prescribed burning because that's another,  another topic that is near and dear to me.  I love prescribed burning and have traveled the United States getting to do burns all  
**[0:58:25-0:58:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:58:25):**  over the US and it's, it's amazing to see.  We may have to come back for that for another episode on another day.  But so lessons learned, well, you can accomplish some wonderful things with the right fire  
**[0:58:40-0:58:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:58:40):**  condition.  The lesson that we learned was mother nature handed us an opportunity on a silver platter.  She did things for us with that fire that, that dad had dreamed about doing for 30 years  
**[0:58:53-0:59:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:58:53):**  with matches and drip torches.  I mean, areas of the ranch were clean that, that had never been possible or feasible to  get fire in that he'd been trying for years.  
**[0:59:02-0:59:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:59:02):**  I didn't have any cattle.  I didn't own cows at that time.  I didn't have any stock.  
**[0:59:06-0:59:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:59:06):**  I didn't have any custom cattle on the ranch.  So I didn't, I didn't have that to worry about, thankfully.  The lessons most valuable to learn were watching the grass come back and watching a much stronger  
**[0:59:20-0:59:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:59:20):**  grass, grasses come back like higher succession grasses.  Okay.  And I think a lot of other people in the area would repeat this, that they've seen more  
**[0:59:30-0:59:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:59:30):**  Indian grass and more big blue stem since the wildfire.  And this year I've started seeing a lot of switchgrass on my place where I've been doing  ultra high density grazing, but not so much where I haven't.  
**[0:59:42-0:59:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:59:42):**  So that's probably another podcast maybe in itself.  So what I want to talk about is grass recovery.  Okay.  
**[0:59:49-0:59:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:59:49):**  And forage production.  And you know, we're talking about it in both the context of a wildfire and of a prescribed  fire.  
**[0:59:58-1:00:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=0:59:58):**  Okay.  So when you time your prescribed fires, you know, there's one school of thought that says  you burn late in the dormant season.  
**[1:00:05-1:00:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:00:05):**  You burn really late in the dormant season because your heavy fuel moisture is going  to be low.  Your fine fuel moisture is going to be low and you're not going to burn up your grass.  
**[1:00:14-1:00:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:00:14):**  I put burn up your grass in quotation marks, right?  Because I think we kind of all agree that perennial grasslands that are fire resistant  that have evolved with fire are not necessarily damaged by fire at any time of the year.  
**[1:00:26-1:00:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:00:26):**  It doesn't matter what time of the year you burn your grass.  If it's a native range, okay, asterisks here in the red Hills, I don't think it matters  when I burn my grass, as long as I manage it appropriately afterwards, give it the appropriate  
**[1:00:42-1:00:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:00:42):**  amount of recovery, following that energy input before I reintroduce animals back to  it to impact it.  Because if you don't, if you don't control the movement of the animals, they prefer those  
**[1:00:54-1:01:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:00:54):**  burn spots.  I know we'll continue to select them and select them and select them and overgrazed them and,  and not use other parts of the pasture.  
**[1:01:01-1:01:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:01:01):**  So that can be a tool, you know, patch burning.  That's you know, that's probably another podcast, but another podcast episode.  But patch burning is a thing that fire managers can use.

But the issue I have with patch burning is once you commit to patch burning, you're married  
**[1:01:22-1:01:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:01:22):**  to it.  Like you're married to it until you quit it.  I mean, you don't just get to take a year off because you feel like it.  
**[1:01:28-1:01:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:01:28):**  I mean, you got to do it every year.  And you got to keep doing it every year until you make the make the decision and switch  to a system that gets away from that every year.  
**[1:01:37-1:01:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:01:37):**  So fire is largely, you know, like I said, fire is used basically in three contexts.  For me, you have your reclamation fire.  And that's getting your land back from the big, big heavy infestation, you have your  
**[1:01:50-1:02:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:01:50):**  restoration fire, that's you're holding the line, that's you're holding the ground, and  you may have to do more than one of those.  And that's getting a little saplings and keeping and, and cleaning stuff up and chipping away  
**[1:02:00-1:02:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:02:00):**  at those edges of those steep canyons that you can't get into, can't get into without,  you know, an extreme fire event, or they're difficult to get into mechanically, keep chipping  away at it till it gets to the point where all you need is a chainsaw.  
**[1:02:14-1:02:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:02:14):**  And you can go down in there and do hand to hand combat with the cedar trees.  So we talk about broader context, okay, like a coordinated strategic body.  Biome preservation plan for the Great Plains needs to look something like we need to leverage  
**[1:02:31-1:02:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:02:31):**  the wildfire events, and fire needs to be the primary tool.  And we need to establish core areas, establish a front line that we can defend.  And once we have an area that we can defend and hold, then we can go back on the offensive.  
**[1:02:46-1:02:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:02:46):**  And what's the offensive look like?  Well, it's more fire because that's the most effective cost effective tool on a per acre  basis to manage land.  
**[1:02:54-1:03:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:02:54):**  It just has to be done appropriately.  You know, I there burned contractors that just charge absolutely absurd amounts of money  to go do burns per acre.  
**[1:03:04-1:03:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:03:04):**  That's great.  I'm glad there's an industry for them.  I try to keep my costs as low as possible because I'm paying out of pocket, right?  
**[1:03:11-1:03:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:03:11):**  I have to pay for all the costs of burning out of pocket.  I have to pay for the deferred grazing out of pocket.  I mean, that may not come out of pocket, but that's definitely an upper lost, lost income.  
**[1:03:22-1:03:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:03:22):**  So it's an opportunity cost to my business for deferred grazing.  So that goes under a cost of burning of what grazing I lose because I need to build up  a forage stockpile to carry a fire because ladder fuels are a thing, right?  
**[1:03:34-1:03:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:03:34):**  You know, then there's the time involved.  There's the investment in the equipment and there's the maintenance in the equipment.  There's the fuel for the drip torches.  
**[1:03:41-1:03:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:03:41):**  There's you know, all the thousand little details on the day of the burn.  Then there's the planning, there's the preparation, there's the going out and the mowing.  There's the, you know, there's the work to go prepare the road, keep get the roads in  
**[1:03:51-1:04:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:03:51):**  good shape so people can travel fast.  You know, make sure the fire lines are well prepared and people can get around them.  Get your maps prepared where everybody has a map.  
**[1:04:01-1:04:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:04:01):**  Things are clearly marked.  Fire lines are marked.  Things are marked with, you know, like I will have it.  
**[1:04:07-1:04:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:04:07):**  I will have some things with a, I will go a to b for things and then other things I  will go one to 10.  So if I call out, Hey, West team, how close are you to point alpha?  
**[1:04:17-1:04:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:04:17):**  Everybody knows what I'm talking about.  I don't have to say, Hey, uh, Hey Bob, are you an Ethel over there by, by that one old  big cottonwood tree.  
**[1:04:26-1:04:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:04:26):**  That's got the, that's got that weird broken branch on it that, uh, maybe has a dead cow  under it.  Like, no.  
**[1:04:33-1:04:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:04:33):**  Are you a point alpha or not?  You know, little things like that.  Um, man, I keep getting off track, so I'm really talking about, I'm trying to, trying  
**[1:04:40-1:04:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:04:40):**  to stay on track here about, uh, you know, grass recovery, forage production and kind  of this, you know, overall strategic biome preservation plan.  Got to start with fire.  
**[1:04:50-1:04:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:04:50):**  Got to establish some cores, make a defense, hold a line.  Yeah.  There's, you know, all my buddies that run mulchers in the world, you're not going out  
**[1:04:57-1:05:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:04:57):**  of business.  Trust me, there's going to be plenty of work for you guys to do.  I'm trying to build that market.  
**[1:05:03-1:05:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:05:03):**  So there's going to be plenty of mechanical work that still needs to be done, you know,  but we need to get to the point where we're spending the bulk of our money where it's  doing the most good, which is on fire.  
**[1:05:13-1:05:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:05:13):**  Instead of trying to spend money running around in ambulances on emergency care with bulldozers,  because that emergency care is 10 times as costly per acre as the fire.  That is an awesome point.  
**[1:05:24-1:05:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:05:24):**  And I'm glad you're sharing this perspective.  And so this leads me though, to another question, because, um, like I said, I'd worked in fire  fire management now gets outreach education kind of side of things.  
**[1:05:35-1:05:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:05:35):**  I can't imagine that everybody agrees with you.  And I guess what are your thoughts on how to communicate and reach those audiences that  may be not, you know, maybe they see fire and to them, you are never going to convince  
**[1:05:52-1:06:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:05:52):**  them that it's a good thing or two, they see prescribed fire and they're wondering why  are you burning their beautiful Kansas Prairie or three, um, you know, any other outlying  factor, I guess, whether, what are your thoughts?  
**[1:06:08-1:06:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:06:08):**  I don't mind being unpopular at the coffee shop and the call out.  I'm not afraid to do that.  I'm not afraid to have an unpopular opinion and speak loudly about that.  
**[1:06:19-1:06:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:06:19):**  Fire is natural part of the environment.  And like, like I was kind of getting into earlier, you know, everybody, every passenger  on Starship earth, unless you live in the desert, surrounded by sand, most of the Florida  
**[1:06:32-1:06:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:06:32):**  Antarctica, you know, whatever, come argue with me.  You are most likely living in an area that is threatened by wildfire.  You better learn how to, you better learn about it.  
**[1:06:41-1:06:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:06:41):**  You better learn how to deal with it and learn how to cope with it.  And California has had wake up calls, multiple wake up calls over the last several years.  You know how they cope with it.  
**[1:06:51-1:06:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:06:51):**  We'll shut off the power grid.  So these power lines don't slap each other and make sparks and start fires.  That will help.  
**[1:06:57-1:07:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:06:57):**  Let's put everybody in the dark when it's windy as crap outside.  You know, a lot of people, a lot of people think that that's what started the starbuck  fire in 2017 is power lines slapping.  
**[1:07:08-1:07:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:07:08):**  I was at 2018.  There was a fire south of here called the Ray fire in Oklahoma down.  I think it started in Dewey County to my buddy, Jimmy Hammond's place.  
**[1:07:16-1:07:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:07:16):**  And who I remember watching that one.  I spent a lot of, I spent like two days just sitting here watching live helicopter feeds.  These guys flying around this fire and it was juniper infestation.  
**[1:07:29-1:07:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:07:29):**  Hell.  I mean, it was ugly, but it, Oh man, it may, it sure made for some pretty footage.  And I don't want to make light of that because you know, there are people that lost their  
**[1:07:38-1:07:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:07:38):**  lives and plenty of livestock loss and that and Starbucks, you know?  Yeah.  There's serious events, but if we take proactive action, you know, and be fire aware I think  
**[1:07:49-1:07:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:07:49):**  fire awareness week was last week.  It's like third week, February now, I think wildfire awareness week, at least in Kansas,  it is.  
**[1:07:56-1:08:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:07:56):**  And we've got to start taking these things seriously and we got to learn how to live,  live in, live in an environment that requires fire to, to function and getting back to that.  So we talked about a reclamation fire.  
**[1:08:10-1:08:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:08:10):**  We talked about the restoration fire.  So where we're at now is a maintenance fire.  Okay.  
**[1:08:15-1:08:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:08:15):**  And the maintenance fire phase, all I'm using, like my, my tree problem to a large extent  is under control.  Okay.  
**[1:08:22-1:08:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:08:22):**  So we'll clean that with, with chainsaws and sawzalls and we'll eventually need another  fire.  Just, you know, clean up the outliers and in five years, maybe, maybe a little bit less.  
**[1:08:32-1:08:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:08:32):**  It might be five years before I'm ready for it.  Then again, we might do it next year because there's a big group of us that are talking  about burning almost 19,000 acres together.  
**[1:08:40-1:08:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:08:40):**  So you know, I, and that's the thing you have to work with your neighbors and shuffle your  plans around.  But anyway, back to the point, which is forage production.  
**[1:08:49-1:09:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:08:49):**  Okay.  So in Kansas, when people think about burning, mostly they think about burning in the context  of burning in the Flint Hill, which is, which is an ecoregion that burns approximately 2  
**[1:09:00-1:09:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:09:00):**  million, one to 2 million acres a year of grassland.  And not to take anything away from them, but you know, they do it so often and so much  like they just drive down the county road and throw matches out the window and then  
**[1:09:12-1:09:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:09:12):**  go to the coffee shop and drink coffee.  Like, you know, they, they don't really have to do as much active management and planning  and preparation as, as a lot of us out here in the red Hills have to do.  
**[1:09:23-1:09:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:09:23):**  And that's cool.  Now, if, if you want to argue, come by social media, fight me, fight me on Twitter.  Don't care.  
**[1:09:28-1:09:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:09:28):**  They burn in the Flint Hills.  Like they're burning season is starting probably now.  I would say if I was in the Flint Hills, I would consider burning season open as soon  
**[1:09:38-1:09:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:09:38):**  as the first day that it's dry enough to carry a fire after the rain.  That's if that makes so like, don't know when I'm going to release this episode.  You know, we're coming up on 90 minutes.  
**[1:09:47-1:09:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:09:47):**  So this, this might even be a special, uh, I'm going to keep going.  I mean, I said, I said, I'd give you two hours and I'm going to give you your full two hours,  ma'am.  
**[1:09:56-1:10:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:09:56):**  Um, I mean, not saying it hasn't been great.  So the guys on the Flint Hills, they primarily burn for four production reasons.  And the timing of that is, is they want to catch like right at the end of the dormant  
**[1:10:08-1:10:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:10:08):**  season, they want to catch the last moisture of the dormant season before the grass wakes  up.  And what they're doing is they're just burning off all the shit, all the stuff they didn't  
**[1:10:17-1:10:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:10:17):**  use last year and letting the new growth come up because that new growth that comes up,  it puts the, keeps the animals on a higher plane of nutrition.  Okay.  
**[1:10:26-1:10:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:10:26):**  The grass is more nutrient dense.  It has more protein.  It has more sugars and more carbohydrates to offer them.  
**[1:10:30-1:10:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:10:30):**  Okay.  And a lot of times you'll start to see this in a regime with constant fire that doesn't  change their management program.  
**[1:10:38-1:10:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:10:38):**  They're seeing this in the Flint Hills.  A lot of guys that are paying attention are starting to see this in the Flint Hills is  that this burning every year between the 15th of March and the 15th of April, and then turning  
**[1:10:50-1:11:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:10:50):**  out on the first of May for 90 days and then shipping them out and doing nothing the rest  of the year, it's starting to really wreak havoc on the plant communities and their pastures.  So the spring burning, it's shifting the timing that they traditionally burn in the Flint  
**[1:11:06-1:11:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:11:06):**  Hills is shifting their grass production away from tall, warm season grasses towards the  shorter cool season grasses and the spring burning is also encouraging the infestation  of a plant called sericea lespedeza, which is horrible, especially if you want to burn  
**[1:11:23-1:11:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:11:23):**  in the spring.  If you burn in the spring, it makes it mad and it spreads more.  It makes the seeds more viable.  
**[1:11:29-1:11:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:11:29):**  Okay.  The good news is goats eat it.  Goats love it.  
**[1:11:33-1:11:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:11:33):**  Like goats just tear that stuff down to shreds.  So they're burning a lot in the spring.  They're getting a lot of sericea.  
**[1:11:38-1:11:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:11:38):**  They're pastures.  I always got to think, you hear about the tall grass beauty of the Flint Hills.  Every time I've driven through there, I don't see anything higher than ankles.  
**[1:11:47-1:12:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:11:47):**  If I can see my cows feet in the pasture, I've done something wrong.  If you could go out there and you see the cow's knees, you don't have a lot of grass.  If you go out there and you can see what they're standing on, you see the bottom of their feet,  
**[1:12:02-1:12:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:12:02):**  the backs of their feet, buddy, you need to go find that critter some more groceries.  But what I'm saying is that continued management scheme of year in, year out, burn early, double  stock, it doesn't do the ecosystem any favors.  
**[1:12:15-1:12:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:12:15):**  The ecosystem needs chain and that's a static system.  It's becoming a static system.  So fire, I guess, is not necessarily practiced appropriately everywhere that it's practiced

There's a big forage production benefit that's been known for a long time.  Even out here in the red hills, we can get some really good gains on yearlings if we  
**[1:12:33-1:12:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:12:33):**  burn, if we burn and catch the rains just right.  It's a little bit harder to do out here, but kind of figuring that out.  So forage production was the thinking, okay?  
**[1:12:44-1:12:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:12:44):**  And that drove the timing.  But there's a big shift in that because of a lot of us have started looking at summer  burns and that's due to research coming out of Oklahoma State University.  
**[1:12:52-1:13:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:12:52):**  Dr. John Ware, homeboy, when I grew up, I want to be like Dr. John Ware.  I love that guy.  He's the one that's really started to push summer burning a lot and, or I should say  
**[1:13:02-1:13:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:13:02):**  growing season burning.  So we're not talking about burning in May or June.  Well, maybe June, later June, but we're definitely talking about burning in July and in August  
**[1:13:12-1:13:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:13:12):**  and even down a little bit into September.  But toward the end of September, you want to kind of taper off your burning.  And I'm not saying that's a hard no, but the timing of burning spring versus summer is  
**[1:13:23-1:13:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:13:23):**  very complicated.  It's a very complicated management decision.  There's so many variables that go into it.  
**[1:13:29-1:13:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:13:29):**  It did take another podcast to unpack.  But basically, we've learned that you can't hurt the native Prairie by burning it.  You can only hurt it by grazing it improperly.  
**[1:13:39-1:13:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:13:39):**  So a lot of these invasive, woody invasive herbaceous species that we have, like I mentioned,  sericea lespedeza, Eastern red cedar, whatever elm tree you like, all these trees that we  brought in, like catalpas, all this crap we've brought in and let run loose and rampant in  
**[1:13:57-1:14:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:13:57):**  our ecosystems.  And a lot of it is very, very vulnerable during the growing season.  Like you can get the same grass production benefits burning in the middle of July, as  
**[1:14:09-1:14:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:14:09):**  you will, the beginning of April.  And the bonus is you will kill a lot more trees.  Now, I'm not saying everybody needs to start burning in June, July and August.  
**[1:14:18-1:14:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:14:18):**  That's not what I'm saying.  But I have looked at the calendar.  I've analyzed the weather patterns during dormant season burning late spring, late spring,  
**[1:14:25-1:14:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:14:25):**  late winter, early spring burning in the 40 to 45 odd day burning window.  We're lucky if we get 10 good burn days.  Lucky.  
**[1:14:36-1:14:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:14:36):**  Okay.  In the 90 day window, June, July, August, historically, there's an average of 55 to  60 days with acceptable weather to burn on.  
**[1:14:45-1:14:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:14:45):**  As a burn manager, I like those odds of being able to plant a burn.  I like those odds a lot more of being able to plant a burn.  Summer burns are challenging.  
**[1:14:52-1:15:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:14:52):**  They have their different logistical challenges.  We mentioned the 80 20 curve earlier.  You want to try to stay on the right side of that 80 20 curve.  
**[1:15:02-1:15:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:15:02):**  Humidity not less than 20% if your temperature is above 80.  If your humidity is below 20 and your temperature is above 80, keep your matches in your pocket  that day, buddy, because things will get wild in that in a hurry.  
**[1:15:13-1:15:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:15:13):**  I don't care how good of a manager you are, how good of a prepper, how well you can prepare  fire line.  If you're over 80 and under 20, you're going to have spot fires.  
**[1:15:22-1:15:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:15:22):**  I promise you.  And I love this is the other thing I love about doing this is kind of sharing stories,  cross collaboration, boundaries, everything.  
**[1:15:32-1:15:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:15:32):**  Like I'm thinking back even to my years in fire and that was, you know, those are our  trigger points.  Like we're not even talking about like prescribed burning.  
**[1:15:38-1:15:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:15:38):**  We're talking about wildland fire season.  Like depending on which part of say the Northern Rockies you were fighting fire in, we followed  that as well.  
**[1:15:47-1:15:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:15:47):**  Your 80 20.  Yeah, you got if it's 80 degrees, start paying attention a lot more closely.  If it's dropping below 20% humidity, you better be monitoring things pretty closely.  
**[1:15:56-1:16:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:15:56):**  And then we always add the factor in of wind as well.  And it was a 20 miles per hour more or less, you know, that was your other trigger point.  And like, I don't know for anyone that's maybe listening like to hear like what that correlates  
**[1:16:08-1:16:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:16:08):**  to and like what that means to fire managers and, and folks that are working on the landscape  with fire.  I think it was low as the year 2007 on the Rocky Mountain front up here in Montana, we  
**[1:16:21-1:16:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:16:21):**  had a big fire called the Skyland fire.  It originally had started out maybe 500 acres in timber, kind of in that East Glacier type  area of the world.  
**[1:16:30-1:16:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:16:30):**  And that was my job at that year was my rookie year on a hotshot crew.  And my job was I was the weather girl, I would go monitor the weather every hour or every  half hour depending on conditions.  
**[1:16:42-1:16:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:16:42):**  And so we've been on this fire for a few days, you know, and usually start monitoring that  weather with slink psychrometer and your little weather gauge at eight o'clock in the morning  and you'd have you'd record those numbers throughout the day, you'd watch the trends,  
**[1:16:55-1:17:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:16:55):**  you'd monitor them, run down tournament division at the end of shift.  Well Skyland fire.  Just looking for my kestrel.  
**[1:17:02-1:17:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:17:02):**  Yes, kestrel.  Just looking for my kestrel.  It was here on my desk.  
**[1:17:07-1:17:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:17:07):**  I see I see it now over there on the shelf.  Yes, the kestrels are awesome.  And but yeah, that was the thing is we've been on this fire for about seven days.  
**[1:17:15-1:17:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:17:15):**  And you know, you're used to what the temperature and humidity was at eight o'clock in the morning,  all of a sudden one morning, I am doing my measurements and the relative humidity, we're  down at already 13%.  
**[1:17:28-1:17:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:17:28):**  And other days at eight o'clock in the morning, we were more in that 27 30 30%.  And you're looking at the temperature.  And the temperature is a little bit warmer to you know, maybe at eight o'clock in the  
**[1:17:39-1:17:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:17:39):**  morning, we had been around 60 something all of a sudden, now we're already getting up  to like, high 70s low 80s.  What's the first thing that happens when I read those numbers over the radio?  
**[1:17:50-1:17:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:17:50):**  Boss says do it again.  All right, do it again.  Like use a different different sling psychrometer get the kestrel like do it again.  
**[1:17:59-1:18:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:17:59):**  Okay result that I like, and we're getting these same numbers and all of a sudden, everything  stops.  Fire crew stop stop digging lines, stop stop.  
**[1:18:09-1:18:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:18:09):**  There's a meeting of the minds, you don't hear much.  And then all of a sudden, like, okay, everybody needs to pull back off the line.  What ends up happening that day, Skyline fire goes from 500 acres to 5000.  
**[1:18:21-1:18:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:18:21):**  And that was that first trigger point was what are we seeing?  And that was, you know, those numbers, and that's why they're important.  And so I guess I just wanted to share that case.  
**[1:18:31-1:18:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:18:31):**  Anyone's listening, like, what are you talking about?  8020?  Like, what is what does this mean?  
**[1:18:35-1:18:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:18:35):**  Why does anyone care?  That's why we care is because it's that it's that first precursor on the ground that you're  seeing things and they're changing quickly.  
**[1:18:43-1:18:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:18:43):**  Yeah, and a lot of, you know, some people like to get hung up on dew point, I don't  want to get hung up on dew point, I want to get hung up, like, give me the raw number,  because that means a lot more to me than telling me, well, the dew point is 57 degrees.  
**[1:18:55-1:19:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:18:55):**  I don't understand that my brain doesn't parse that maybe yours does maybe some other people's  do.  You tell me the humidity is 57% and is going to be 6061% at 8pm.  
**[1:19:04-1:19:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:19:04):**  Okay, I know what that means.  You know, I can understand that as a fireman.  Yes.  
**[1:19:10-1:19:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:19:10):**  But we're still talking about fire in the context of forage production.  Okay.  And this is this is something that that's really important for me to say, okay.  
**[1:19:21-1:19:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:19:21):**  Now, I mentioned when we started that, you know, I've been trained in holistic management,  big fan Alan Savory, only thing I disagree with Alan Savory on is the use of fire.  I, I agree with him that it's practiced too much.  
**[1:19:34-1:19:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:19:34):**  But he does not agree that it's a critical management tool to restore grasslands.  He thinks he thinks it can all be done with animal like I've seen the math, there's no  way we can breed the cattle and the bison required to be able to trample all the cedar  
**[1:19:49-1:19:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:19:49):**  trees out of existence.  I'm sorry, Mr. Savory, I have a mint respect for you.  It's not going to happen.  
**[1:19:55-1:20:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:19:55):**  We need our fire.  So fire in a holistic management context, as far as applicable to a grazing manager  in my use there.  
**[1:20:04-1:20:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:20:04):**  I'm using fire in a sense that I'm leaving too much forage behind, okay.  And that matter builds up over time.  And when it reaches a point that it becomes decadent and over lignified, nothing will  
**[1:20:17-1:20:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:20:17):**  touch it.  And then it starts to oxidize and become and you'll see this if you if you understand how  to look at grass and you start looking down into the tall grass at that understory.  
**[1:20:29-1:20:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:20:29):**  And if you can see grayish blackish kind of color, that's very unhealthy grass.  That's grass that has lacked animal impact for too long.  You either need to graze the crap out of it ultra high density, or you need to go light  
**[1:20:43-1:21:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:20:43):**  it on fire and reset that grass plant back to a higher productive state.  So does that explain why I use fire like all of my uses of fire.  So I'm basically I'm using fire to replace the lack of stock density on a two for two  
**[1:21:01-1:21:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:21:01):**  reasons, okay, lack of stock density because I can't use all the forage that I can grow  effectively.  And I don't think as a manager, you should try to use all the forage that you grow, you  
**[1:21:09-1:21:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:21:09):**  should always leave a little bit on the table, you know, just in case something bad happens.  But I'm not, I can't quite get my stocking right to the point that I want.  So we have to replicate some of that herd effect with fire.  
**[1:21:23-1:21:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:21:23):**  And you know, there's still some of that, some of that restoration and maintenance phase  that I have to do with my cedar problem.  So there's two management contexts that I use fire.  
**[1:21:32-1:21:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:21:32):**  And I think that all of all of the burning that I'm going to do on my property, I'm doing  it all in this.  I'm not doing any more spring burn.  
**[1:21:39-1:21:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:21:39):**  I like I like summer burning easier.  It's easier to manage.  I mean, it's not as easier physically for the crew.  
**[1:21:46-1:21:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:21:46):**  I mean, it's, it's a lot harder physically for the crew, because, you know, it's generally  harder.  Everybody's on a side by side.  
**[1:21:54-1:22:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:21:54):**  Everybody's on a four wheeler.  And if there's enough people I have even gone as far as to appoint a water boy.  I mean, I say that I didn't give him that title.  
**[1:22:02-1:22:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:22:02):**  But that's what they did.  They drove around in a side by side with a cooler of water.  And that's all they did is bounce from one, you know, one fire team at the head of one  
**[1:22:11-1:22:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:22:11):**  flank to the other one, and then check in with a security brief back and forth.  All they did was deliver water all day and make sure everybody stayed high.  So wow, I don't know, have we left a lot?  
**[1:22:22-1:22:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:22:22):**  Have we left much on the table Domo?  Well, I can always come up with more and more questions.  I mean, I seriously like I spent hours like riding around people's ranches talking about  
**[1:22:33-1:22:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:22:33):**  about stuff with I just love I love hearing all of it and  I'd love to have you I'd love to have you come down sometime and turn around and and  show you some of the other things.  
**[1:22:44-1:22:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:22:44):**  You know, after the 2008 fire, there was another fire not far away.  That happened several months after that 2008 fire.  And one of the big wake up calls in 2016 was after Anderson Creek affected.  
**[1:22:56-1:23:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:22:56):**  I kind of wanted to go around and get a preview.  Like what's 10 years?  What What does this look like in eight or 10 years if I don't do anything?  
**[1:23:04-1:23:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:23:04):**  And I saw those results.  And I said, Nope, nope, my place ain't gonna look like that.  And then six months later, I took delivery that Komatsu for two years, I learned how  
**[1:23:13-1:23:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:23:13):**  to run an excavator and make trees turn into chips, and had a lot of fun doing it.  And some of those places where there's so much of that, that biomass, that woody biomass,  I was surprised the areas where there are still live trees that are ground up and mulched

**[1:23:34-1:23:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:23:34):**  So the stuff I got, because I fed the soil, I fed the soil with carbon with wood, I fed  the soil with carbon with with ash and burn up cedar trees, you know, and then then going  through there with the machine was a disturbance, right?  
**[1:23:49-1:24:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:23:49):**  And those, you know, that wood flying around hitting the ground, all different shapes and  sizes, all that was just massive disturbance, you know, I can't hire a herd of a million  mastodons to come through my ranch, and blast down these canes and flatten all their shit.  
**[1:24:05-1:24:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:24:05):**  Like, that's not a thing right now.  I mean, I wish that was a business that you know, I wish that was a contract business  model you go hire, like, you know, mammoth demolition or something, we show up with our  
**[1:24:14-1:24:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:24:14):**  extinct creatures that we've cloned in a lab and we run them around your ranch and trample  shit in the ground.  Why is that not a thing?  
**[1:24:22-1:24:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:24:22):**  Elon Musk wants to go to Mars and he can build starships like that, that project would be  pocket change.  Don't even get me started on Bill Gates and how much money that guy wasted on his carbon  
**[1:24:32-1:24:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:24:32):**  credits.  You know, he paid between six and $1200 a ton for his carbon credits.  I can't wrap my brain around that.  
**[1:24:39-1:24:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:24:39):**  That's like they're selling on a European market right now for $48.  And I think that that's I think that's vastly undervalued.  But then the kicker is they're like offering 16 or 20 to a ton for producers of sequester  
**[1:24:52-1:25:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:24:52):**  carbon I'm thinking Bill Gates will pay 1200 bucks a ton.  I'm not taking 20.  That's what I think about carbon right now.  
**[1:25:01-1:25:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:25:01):**  But I might change.  And you know what?  Okay, so let's we're talking about fire carbon.  
**[1:25:07-1:25:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:25:07):**  Okay.  So there might be an objection.  Because the carbon cycling, while you're burning, you're creating a lot of carbon, you're creating  
**[1:25:13-1:25:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:25:13):**  a lot of pollution, you're putting soot in the air, it's all natural, it goes away.  It's not like it's a burning stack of tires.  It's not like it's, it's not like it's smoke out of a power plant that you can't see that  
**[1:25:25-1:25:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:25:25):**  contains unseen pollutants that do not disperse naturally in there.  Like everything that the grass fire puts off, or even you know, woodland fire, all those  products are cycled back into nature back into the atmosphere back into the soil back  
**[1:25:37-1:25:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:25:37):**  into other plants that all cycles.  That's not pollution.  Okay.  
**[1:25:41-1:25:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:25:41):**  It's regeneration.  You know, people might say, well, you want to burn up?  Well, right, you want to burn up all the trees and grow grass?  
**[1:25:48-1:26:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:25:48):**  Well, the trees sequester carbon.  Well, what if I told you that perennial grassland can sequester far more carbon than any tree  that we could possibly grow on it.  
**[1:26:00-1:26:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:26:00):**  And the fun part is soil carbon storage is a permanent solution, right?  We're putting it in the soil, we're storing it in the soil.  But when you're storing carbon as a tree that is stored above ground, and that carbon is  
**[1:26:14-1:26:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:26:14):**  ultimately susceptible to rot and further cycling, and it returns back to the earth,  the only carbon that we can store successfully is in our soil.  Like since we're on a carbon kick, the numbers I quoted earlier about Bill Gates and then  
**[1:26:27-1:26:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:26:27):**  price of carbon that came from an article I posted this morning, it was out on Bloomberg.  So if you followed Red Hills Rancher, you probably saw that a couple weeks ago.  Just the prices he was willing to pay were ridiculous and the projects they were talking  
**[1:26:39-1:26:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:26:39):**  about was so there is this geothermal power plant isolate, okay.  And they wanted to offset their carbon emissions because they're not 100% green or sustainable,  even though their geothermal power plant, they have to have a natural gas power plant  
**[1:26:53-1:27:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:26:53):**  on site so they can bootstrap so they can start up.  Okay.  So they decided they were going to build their own carbon capture plant that was going to  
**[1:27:00-1:27:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:27:00):**  suck CO2 out of the atmosphere and inject it down into the rocks where it would eventually  turn into a rock or like inject it at such a high pressure as a liquid into a rock formation  that it became rock.  
**[1:27:12-1:27:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:27:12):**  I didn't really understand it.  It was a five paragraph article on Bloomberg and the numbers were a lot more interesting  to me.  
**[1:27:19-1:27:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:27:19):**  So whatever this magic technology is that they're using to try to sequester carbon,  okay, they say that their costs, they built this plant because it was cheaper for them  to build and operate their own carbon sequestration plant than it was for them to buy credits  
**[1:27:35-1:27:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:27:35):**  on the European market.  Okay.  Credits on the European market are quoted at $48 and this company, they claim that their  
**[1:27:41-1:27:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:27:41):**  costs to sequester their own carbon was $25 a ton and they were kind of bragging about  that.  Like the paragraph before that was Bill Gates saying like, quote the company that he buys  
**[1:27:52-1:28:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:27:52):**  his from in bulk because that's what billionaires do, I guess.  You buy carbon credits in bulk because you have a 66,000 square foot private home and  you fly around the world in a jet that uses over 500 gallons of fuel an hour and you go  
**[1:28:11-1:28:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:28:11):**  around the world in your jet to get on television and lecture us about eating fake meat and  how we need to reduce our environmental impacts.  If Bill Gates wants to pay between $6 and $1,200 a ton for his carbon credits, good  
**[1:28:25-1:28:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:28:25):**  for him.  That's great, but he needs to stop telling us how we need to manage our lives, how we  should eat and how we should think.  
**[1:28:33-1:28:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:28:33):**  I'm kind of upset about that.  Well, obviously, you got real fired up.  So I was just going to say, wrapping it way far back into our conversation earlier, your  
**[1:28:49-1:29:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:28:49):**  prescribed fire burn association in Kansas and then you were talking later on about managing  land and fire on a kind of a biome type idea across all of your area.  I think, I totally think that's doable and I could see a beautiful, if it isn't already  
**[1:29:08-1:29:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:29:08):**  happening, a beautiful partnership between either Kansas Forestry and the prescribed  burn association and any other kind of entity.  I know kind of the TNC, they use a board with a lot of stuff like that as well and I could  
**[1:29:21-1:29:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:29:21):**  totally see it happening and being beautiful.  And I know here in Montana, I'm involved with our Montana Fire Adaptive Communities Learning  Network and we're always sharing ideas across the state because I mean, Montana, we're so  
**[1:29:37-1:29:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:29:37):**  big and we're so diverse.  Like I said, that western side is totally different than our eastern side here.  And so challenges on the west side might not always register on a side and vice versa.  
**[1:29:49-1:29:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:29:49):**  And I know one of the things that all of us involved, because I mean, we've got an interesting  group.  It's diverse participants.  
**[1:29:56-1:30:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:29:56):**  We've got extension, we've got the state, we've got private land conservation groups,  we've got private groups working in kind of, you know, more urban interface type areas,  some more rural, some more populated, and just super diverse.  
**[1:30:11-1:30:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:30:11):**  And you know, I would love to see personally, like something like a prescribed fire burn  association here in Montana, or even like I know in Oregon and Idaho, they've got the  rangeland fire protection associations that are kind of a little more diverse.  
**[1:30:25-1:30:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:30:25):**  And I think something like that, a model here would work great in Montana.  And I absolutely name dropped you to the girl that coordinates like tours and stuff because  I was like, you know, I think if there's a shot of us getting something like this going  
**[1:30:39-1:30:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:30:39):**  in Montana, you know, we should bring in folks from other states who have done it and are  involved with it.  And certainly available for consulting.  
**[1:30:47-1:31:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:30:47):**  I that's yeah, I told they told them, make it happen.  But yeah, I mean, and that's the thing like you were talking about, even going back to  the patch burning versus say landscape scale, like, get all the little patches together,  
**[1:31:03-1:31:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:31:03):**  because in eastern Montana, the reality is, you know, it's fairly common in the springtime,  you're going to see ditches burning, you're going to see fields burning, private landowners  do it, whether you have your burn permit or not, people do it.  
**[1:31:15-1:31:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:31:15):**  Scrape scale, you know, the federal agencies, they do it.  But sometimes not everybody does it together really well.  And I think if everybody could bring together under one of those associations, or even something  
**[1:31:29-1:31:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:31:29):**  of the sort, big, beautiful things could happen.  And it would be way less daunting to do it with a bunch of partners involved versus everybody  going on their own trying to figure it out.  
**[1:31:39-1:31:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:31:39):**  I agree with everything you said, it's just going to take it's just going to take time  to build that critical mass and to get into gain the momentum.  You know, it's, it's after Anderson Creek, you'd think that they would learn their lesson  
**[1:31:53-1:32:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:31:53):**  with about coordination and communication on fire response would have maybe changed  some of their systems before the next bad fires.  But they didn't.  
**[1:32:01-1:32:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:32:01):**  I mean, they put in a couple stopgap measures that, you know, you kind of see that, okay,  well, that's just a bandaid that isn't going to do much.  And they said, Well, we're going to keep working on it.  
**[1:32:10-1:32:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:32:10):**  Well, then, you know, we had Starbucks fire, and we got another hard lesson in how to work  together with other departments, you know, across state lines with other help.  And like I mentioned earlier, you know, they come lead some bounds since then, you know,  
**[1:32:24-1:32:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:32:24):**  with not just training of rural departments, but also with communication between departments  and mutual aid response and getting, you know, being able to get high level assets, like  not just mutual aid assets, but get the high level command and control assets, you know,  
**[1:32:40-1:32:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:32:40):**  with major tanker support and a lot of organization that can come down to relieve the locals,  you know, the locals, the locals got to, you know, they're the first ones to the fight,  obviously, and they're the ones that know it, and it's, and they're gonna wear out fast.  
**[1:32:53-1:33:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:32:53):**  So getting getting reinforcements to the scene faster is, you know, obviously a better thing,  but getting off track, and I know we are running, we are kind of running short on time, what  we're talking about is, you know, is, is a, is a strategic biome preservation plan, and,  
**[1:33:10-1:33:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:33:10):**  and getting on board, you know, how do we communicate with the stakeholders?  How do you get all the stakeholders involved?  You know, there's a lot, you know, there's a lot of NGOs, there's a lot of municipalities,  
**[1:33:20-1:33:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:33:20):**  there's a lot of private landowners, you know, all up and down the Great Plains, it's got  to be a coordinated effort, and it's just going to take time, take time to spread the  word and build the momentum.  
**[1:33:30-1:33:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:33:30):**  And between now and then, we leverage wildfire events, and we build cores, we build core  defense to stop the grasslands from converting to close canopy juniper forests.  Well, awesome.  
**[1:33:41-1:33:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:33:41):**  Well, thank you, Brian, so much for taking the time to talk with me and share your stories  and and be involved with our little project here trying to do in Montana.  And who knows, someday we'll maybe read your story and your experiences, and maybe they'll,  
**[1:33:57-1:34:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:33:57):**  they'll do beautiful things here in Montana and help everyone out.  Right.  I've really enjoyed the conversation today.  
**[1:34:02-1:34:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:34:02):**  And with that, I just want to say, Bill, it's been an absolute pleasure visiting with you  today about fire and management.  I know I said I'd give you two hours and we ran all of that and maybe, maybe almost a  
**[1:34:15-1:34:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:34:15):**  little more.  And I think we're definitely going to have to have you back soon to talk more about fire  and management and when it's appropriate.  
**[1:34:24-1:34:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/Bonus-5-with-Dominique-Domo-Woodham-All-About-Fire-es4b57#t=1:34:24):**  So if you're not already following the podcast, you can check us out on all major platforms  run Apple, Google, Apple and Google and Breaker.

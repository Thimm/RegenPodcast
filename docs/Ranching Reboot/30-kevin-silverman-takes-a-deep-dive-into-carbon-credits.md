CK and I are really excited for today's guest.  We talk about things like what is regenerative ag?  
**[0:01:05-0:01:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:01:05):**  What is a carbon credit?  What is the difference between avoidance and drawdown when we're talking about carbon?  In fact, today's discussion is all about carbon.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:01:14):**  That's pretty much all we talk about.  And we get way down into the weeds about some specifics about carbon credits that I really  didn't even know existed.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:01:22):**  So buckle up, strap on, do whatever you gotta do.  Let's take a ride with Kevin Silverman.  How's it going?  
**[0:01:28-0:01:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:01:28):**  Hey.  Hey Kevin, good to meet you.  Good to meet you.  
**[0:01:32-0:01:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:01:32):**  How are you doing, Ryan?  Well, I'm doing really good today.  It was nice and cool.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:01:37):**  Only kind of mid 80s, which is a nice break from the heat.  Had a little moisture recently.  So I spent the morning out cleaning up some strays because we're going to be bringing  
**[0:01:45-0:01:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:01:45):**  in, going to be coming in pretty soon to preg check.  So had to get everything together and start them on the way back.  What about you?  
**[0:01:53-0:02:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:01:53):**  What have you been up to?  You know, just here working in carbon land, doing a lot of writing.  Yeah, lots of interesting meetings.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:02:02):**  I feel like things are really heating up right now.  So it's an interesting time and we'll see how things go in this last quarter.  So carbon, that's why we're here today to talk all about carbon.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:02:17):**  And I guess we're talking about soil carbon, right?  Yeah, we could also talk about carbon in general if you want me to explain what a carbon credit  is and stuff like that.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:02:30):**  Yeah, sure.  Let's break it down to kind of a more basic level for some of our listeners.  Let's talk about what a credit is, who has to buy them, and then we can start to move  
**[0:02:41-0:02:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:02:41):**  into the sequestration and the soil works and grassroots carbon side of it.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm happy to talk about my background.  
**[0:02:53-0:03:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:02:53):**  I don't have much of a background.  I think it's always important.  Our listeners really want to know who you are.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:03:03):**  Every time they have a guest, they want to know what's your background, where did you  come from.  And I think that that context is just something that everyone's, I'm always interested in.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:03:10):**  I had no idea, like Travis Krause last week, I had no idea that he was, and I'm going to  butcher it, but in the parasite world in India, I had no idea.  So I think just like I worked for the Gates Foundation, which is crazy.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:03:23):**  Oh, that's fun.  So Kevin Silverman is our guest this week.  And so Kevin, tell us a little bit about just like your background and then maybe just like  
**[0:03:33-0:03:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:03:33):**  how you got into Regen Ag because I feel like your previous, I'm not going to say life,  but I'm going to say life was not in Regen Ag, right?  So this is kind of just, it found you, I feel like.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:03:47):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  So to give some context, you know, I've always been a city boy.  
**[0:03:52-0:04:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:03:52):**  I grew up between Miami and the Dominican Republic.  I went to school in western Mass, but you know, I studied history.  I thought I was going to go more for traditional finance and I did some interesting jobs.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:04:02):**  Before working at Soilworks, I worked at a VC job with venture capital.  So I was kind of investing in startups, really early stage stuff.  But after that, I was kind of looking for something more, I guess, impactful, like thinking  
**[0:04:17-0:04:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:04:17):**  about what's really important, it's really foundational.  And I joined this fellowship that puts young people like myself, like I'm only 25, in emerging  cities in the US and Soilworks is hiring through the program called Venture for America.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:04:32):**  And I just took a leap of faith.  I didn't really know what regenerative was beyond reading a couple books, like dirt to  soil and around the time I joined, that's when Kiss the Ground came out.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:04:43):**  So yeah, so that's kind of, I just took a leap because they wanted kind of a more research  position.  I had done a fair bit of biology research in college, one on the botany side, so I understood  
**[0:04:53-0:05:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:04:53):**  how kind of like soil carbon work and a lot of the science behind it.  It was just an interesting mix.  You know, I think regenerative is a really unique place.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:05:02):**  I'll be really blunt here, to do well and do good.  It's not just, you know, I think you're going to see a lot of people going into regenerative  over the next generation that might not have been appealed to it.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:05:14):**  And it's not just because of infrastructure being built, like CK, you and I have talked  about like Starlink and better broadband access for folks that might want to live a quieter  rural life and do like a high paying, you know, software engineering job.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:05:27):**  But I think regenerative is a really unique generational opportunity.  And I think folks have like a five to 10 year window to get in, are they going to miss the  boat?  
**[0:05:38-0:05:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:05:38):**  Yeah, it's just weird.  You know, I went back home this weekend and I was shopping with my dad and it was just  as weird, you know, after you're kind of working regenerative and talking to a lot of producers  
**[0:05:48-0:05:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:05:48):**  and kind of learning what producers are wary of and learning, you know, reputations in  the space.  It was just weird to see how much my food, you know, like literally the stuff that I'm  
**[0:05:57-0:06:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:05:57):**  putting in my body, how much that's changed and going to my childhood grocery, like other  things I would have just picked, you know, without question, you know, a year ago now  I'm really thinking about her.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:06:07):**  You know, I can talk to my dad and say, Hey, you know, you should buy, you know, X product  instead of Y product, you know, like with eggs, for example, it's like, there's so many  different options and they all have like the same words.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:06:16):**  So it's like, you know, that's, it's really interesting to kind of like dive into that  world and really know where that comes from because it's just so disembodied right now.  And it's crazy looking back on it.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:06:30):**  So you're totally bought in, you're, you're totally bought into the regenerative local  food and you've changed how you've eaten.  And so you've only, and you've only been in the regenerative world for what, a year, 18  
**[0:06:42-0:06:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:06:42):**  months?  Yeah, I'd say a year.  You know, one thing I'll say is I don't think local food necessarily correlates with regenerative.  
**[0:06:50-0:07:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:06:50):**  I think local foods great because one you're supporting a local economy and two local farmers  are the best way to learn the most about your food.  You know, like it gives a human face to it and it's responsive.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:07:00):**  Like if I want to learn, you know, what practices someone does at a grocery store, it's really  difficult unless it's local, unless they have an Instagram page or Facebook page where you  can, you know, send them a message or, you know, email them.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:07:15):**  But I'm not sure it'll have the impact that skill that we need, you know, be it with greenhouse  gases or, you know, in fighting climate change, you know, local's good, but I think it could  be better.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:07:26):**  And with regards to buying into regenerative, I've always struggled in defining regenerative,  you know, soil works.  We're really focused on soil health and ecosystem services and kind of supporting, you know,  
**[0:07:37-0:07:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:07:37):**  making family farms more profitable.  So family farm profitability to us is regenerative.  And I know Travis, for example, last week talked about worker welfare.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:07:46):**  And I think that's a really understated part of regenerative, especially on the animal  protein side.  So I feel like the issue is if you keep adding things to regenerative, regenerative means  
**[0:07:57-0:08:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:07:57):**  everything to everyone.  So I've always had a hard time really discerning which are the key principles that regenerative  should really be about versus what does it mean to me, if that makes sense.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:08:11):**  I think everyone struggles with that.  Yeah, it's one of those hard things to define.  Like, you know, somebody asked me today, how do you define regenerative agriculture?  
**[0:08:22-0:08:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:08:22):**  And tomorrow I might have a slightly different answer.  It just depends on what I've been thinking about.  And sometimes it also depends on who you're talking to as well.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:08:34):**  There's a lot of people you start talking about carbon and soil biology and the bacterial  fungal ratio in soils, and they just kind of glaze over and they go, just tell me what  feed I need to buy and how much I need to put out.  
**[0:08:46-0:09:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:08:46):**  Yeah, I mean, and then that's to their lived experience.  You know, with regenerative, it's like, you know, if you're talking to a producer, it's  important to talk about restoring the ecosystem, but it's also important to talk about, like  
**[0:09:00-0:09:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:09:00):**  I said, like the bottom line impact that it can make for producers and how that works.  You know, there's one, you can over promise and say that the turnaround period isn't as  high as it is and that you don't need transition financing when you might really need it.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:09:16):**  Or two, you know, that's just completely left out of the equation, especially if you're  mentioning carbon credits and the way regenerative land management might increase the value of  a property and restore the ecosystem.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:09:29):**  So you're totally right that it means a lot of different things to different people, but  I think most things in the world are context dependent.  So you always need to provide as much context as possible.  
**[0:09:42-0:10:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:09:42):**  I think somewhere along the way, regenerative isn't necessarily an end state.  It's not a, I mean, it's a goal, but it's a moving target.  It's a path that we're on and a thing that we're striving towards and we're going to  
**[0:10:00-0:10:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:10:00):**  keep trying to make it better, but there's no definable end goal in sight as of yet.  I don't think there should be though.  You know, I think if you define it, then it becomes like the new organic or becomes greenwash,  
**[0:10:14-0:10:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:10:14):**  right?  It's almost like a challenge.  Like, let's see how good we can make it.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:10:19):**  Let's see how good we can do.  So that was probably a great rabbit trail.  So now let's talk about carbon credits.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:10:30):**  What is a carbon credit?  That's interesting though, is you can have a regenerative beef system and by regenerative  being closed loop restoring the ecosystem.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:10:41):**  But it's interesting with folks that are doing poultry and pigs that you're always going  to need some input and that can never be regenerative, like fully regenerative.  But does that really matter?  
**[0:10:54-0:11:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:10:54):**  Does that mean it's not worth it?  I think it's still worth it to do.  So I think I just want to end on the note, like there's a lot of corporations that are  
**[0:11:04-0:11:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:11:04):**  really adopting regenerative pledges and I don't really know what those mean, especially  if their products come from monocrops or they're doing these really large, destructive agricultural  practices at the millions of acre scale.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:11:21):**  So I'm not really sure how many trade-offs regenerative can accept, but I do think that  it is a worthwhile pledge to make and I'm glad that at least people are adopting that  vocabulary because then you can hold them more accountable.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:11:32):**  And also with regenerative, it's like if you're not making things better, if you're just keeping  things as they are, that's not good enough.  Regenerative is about growing towards something else.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:11:41):**  Yeah, that would be sustainable.  And we figured out a half a decade ago that sustainable just wasn't good enough.  We can't maintain the current screwed up state forever.

**[0:11:57-0:12:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:11:57):**  What the heck is a carbon credit, Kevin?  Yeah, so that's a great question.  It's not an easy one to answer.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:12:05):**  So at its core, a carbon credit is a tradable and retireable certificate that equates to  one ton equivalent of CO2 emissions.  So it's carbon dioxide emissions that has not entered into the atmosphere.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:12:23):**  It's a very technical definition and that this is kind of the institutional historical  term of the carbon credit that's been used for the past 25 years since the Kyoto Protocols.  Now I'm bringing this up because there's two ways to generate a carbon credit.  
**[0:12:39-0:12:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:12:39):**  One is you get paid to avoid releasing something into the atmosphere.  So an agricultural example is if you have a feedlot with a bunch of manure, you use  a digester to make sure that the methane doesn't escape into the atmosphere.  
**[0:12:57-0:13:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:12:57):**  Or if you're applying a lot of nitrogen fertilizer every year, you're paid to stop doing that.  So that is called what I call at least an avoided emission.  You're being paid not to do a practice that would result in further emissions.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:13:09):**  The second one is from carbon drawdown.  And this is getting a lot more attention lately.  And essentially what this is, is you can either use machinery, like it's called direct air  
**[0:13:21-0:13:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:13:21):**  capture to literally suck carbon out of the air, or you can use a nature based solution,  like this regenerative agriculture style land management that we're talking about.  Or there's this cool ocean based things or forestry where you harness the power of nature  
**[0:13:38-0:13:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:13:38):**  almost to start drawing down carbon.  Both are acceptable forms of generating carbon credits.  So typically it's like in a year, the end of the year, at the end of some sort of timeframe,  
**[0:13:52-0:14:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:13:52):**  you start accounting for it and the certificate is generated after there's been verification  or after it's in a registry.  A registry is essentially a third party that issues the certificate.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:14:06):**  So typically the person that's developing the project, the landowner, they're not issuing  their own certificate.  There is not Kevin Sullivan credits.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:14:15):**  For example, Grassroots Carbon uses B-carbon, which is a registry based out of Houston,  Texas that's affiliated with the Baker Institute at Rice University.  There's a couple of major registries, but honestly that sets its own world that we don't  
**[0:14:32-0:14:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:14:32):**  need to get into.  But the thing that is worth mentioning is that there's two types of credits.  One of them is voluntary, which means that the government is not overseeing and regulating  
**[0:14:44-0:14:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:14:44):**  it.  And then there's compliance markets, which means that the government is directly involved  in kind of setting emission goals and baselines and regulating the trade of these carbon certificates.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:14:59):**  In California, there's a cap and trade program.  In a couple of states in the US, there's kind of like a regulated voluntary market for carbon  programs.  
**[0:15:08-0:15:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:15:08):**  And in Europe, there's a compliance market that's growing every year.  Okay.  So, why is soil one of the better ways forward?  
**[0:15:23-0:15:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:15:23):**  Why is soil one of the better ways to store carbon?  Yeah, so there's a couple reasons why soil is such an attractive solution.  The first is just scale.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:15:36):**  Hundreds of millions of acres are used for agriculture in the US.  And that, you know, it's been degraded over time over the past century, if not longer.  So the opportunity to one, restore ecosystems.  
**[0:15:53-0:16:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:15:53):**  So that's like a co-benefit on such a large area of land is something that's really attractive.  And two is, you know, this is kind of back of the envelope math, and it really varies  ecologically, but, you know, if you're storing one ton of carbon per acre, on average, and  
**[0:16:12-0:16:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:16:12):**  that's honestly a low estimate, given what certain research papers suggest, this is both  for grazing and for crops.  If you're starting one or two tons of carbon per acre, over, you know, 800 million acres  
**[0:16:26-0:16:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:16:26):**  in the US, then that equates to over, you know, a gigaton of carbon sequestered every  year.  And that really, really changes the carbon accounting that we need.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:16:40):**  People really, well, I won't say people, but I'll say corporate buyers, and a lot of folks  are really paying premium prices for carbon drawdown versus avoided emissions, because  it's almost like people are getting the sense of urgency that it's not enough right now  
**[0:16:54-0:17:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:16:54):**  to avoid further emissions, but it's time now to directly take out from the atmosphere.  Obviously, this is a little bit, you know, difficult.  I think extreme weather events are really kind of pushing this forward.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:17:08):**  I think folks are starting to feel the effects a little more concretely.  But there's still a market for avoided emissions.  I think, you know, it's important for people to be aware of that.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:17:20):**  Are avoidance credits and drawdown credits, are they basically the same thing on the market?  Are they priced the same?  You know, one of the issues with carbon credit markets, because it's voluntary, is that it's  
**[0:17:32-0:17:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:17:32):**  really hard to get transparent pricing data.  There are some groups that do surveys, there's plenty of groups that look at kind of cross  sections of the market over time.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:17:41):**  But I'd say that, you know, avoidance credits are probably going at roughly half, if not  less the price of removal credits.  I think towards the end of the year, so I think this is interesting, you know, a lot  
**[0:17:58-0:18:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:17:58):**  of companies towards the end of the year, once their fiscal year is coming into close,  that's when they really start announcing, you know, their carbon commitments and who  they're buying from and stuff.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:18:08):**  So as that becomes clear, I think what we'll see is that a lot of the bigger names will  start purchasing from carbon removal projects or investing in projects that are directly  associated with carbon removal as opposed to avoided emissions, because avoided emissions  
**[0:18:24-0:18:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:18:24):**  are generally treated as being of lower quality.  And they're also a lot easier to get.  So the market's kind of saturated with these old credits from projects and, you know, certain  
**[0:18:35-0:18:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:18:35):**  parts of the world from like, you know, the mid 2000s or the early 2010s.  And you know, if you're buying that, what are you really doing for the environment?  The whole point of a carbon credit is to catalyze something forward, to pay someone, you know,  
**[0:18:51-0:19:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:18:51):**  in our case for their ecosystem services.  So one, more people adopt, and two, so that, you know, they can continue doing that practice  and so that it's an attractive financial opportunity versus, you know, just paying someone that  
**[0:19:06-0:19:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:19:06):**  organized some project over a decade ago.  So with the carbon program that we're doing, Kevin, with Grassroots Carbon, there's also  a permanence piece.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:19:22):**  Can you speak on that too?  Because I just want to, I guess my whole goal for this too is we get a lot of questions  from our ranching reboot paddock and just people in general.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:19:32):**  So I just want this to be like a 101 throw all the information at them so that they can  kind of get a brief overview of the permanence piece.  We can talk about additionality and we can talk about other things.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:19:45):**  Yeah.  So, um, so CK, something, you know, I gave a talk in Degenes a couple of weeks ago to  a peer rancher group that Travis organizes under the Texas Grazing Lands Coalition and  
**[0:19:59-0:20:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:19:59):**  something, you know, that's important with permanence, important with all these things  is what producers should know if they're going into a carbon credit sort of agreement.  Like what are the risks?  
**[0:20:12-0:20:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:20:12):**  What should they be kind of eyeing out?  What questions should they have?  Um, so I have a little kind of a short list.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:20:17):**  I'm, I'm happy to share, you know, I'm curious for what you guys think.  Um, but you know, the first thing is, is that these are never going to be short contracts  and that's because of the nature of how soil works.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:20:30):**  You know, um, that's my soil works, but it's, you know, if you draw down carbon in the soil  and then you till it the next year, it's just going to be released back into the atmosphere  and you know, that's, um, that's by the nature of just how the, um, the drawdown works, you  
**[0:20:47-0:21:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:20:47):**  know, the, you know, it's photosynthesized through the, through the grass and then through  the roots, um, you know, it goes into the soil and you have kind of like the, the microbial  processes and over time it'll actually go into more permanent pools of carbon.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:21:01):**  So there's one pool that's called mineral associated organic matter.  That's like thousands years of permanence that it's never going to be touched unless  people are just drilling through the land.  
**[0:21:11-0:21:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:21:11):**  So you need to see some sort of continual land management, um, over time in order to  achieve any results like that.  So you know, we're, we have one of the shortest contract lengths where we're 10 years.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:21:27):**  Um, for example, another registry, Vera, um, their standard contract is it's supposed to  be of a hundred years, but their minimum is 25.  Uh, the American carbon registry has something called tenure accounting where it's a hundred  
**[0:21:40-0:21:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:21:40):**  year contract, but essentially, you know, if you sign a 30 year contract, you're only  going to get paid for a third of your car.  So a lot of these folks are really thinking in this hundred year timeframe that, you know,  
**[0:21:53-0:22:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:21:53):**  if I'm signing that contract, I'm binding a lot of people into that because I'm, I probably  won't be around a hundred years.  I can't sign a hundred year contract.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:22:01):**  I can't do that.  I'm going to be in a bat, you know, I don't even know.  Um, but I, you know, 10 years is a commitment as well.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:22:13):**  And you know, having some sort of rolling agreement like we have where each year the  landowner signs on for another year tacked on in the end, I think that provides good  flexibility, but that's not really the market standard.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:22:24):**  Um, so understanding kind of where you're at.  Um, and if you know, if you do have the capacity to continue these practices for so long, um,  is really important.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:22:34):**  Um, the second thing that matters is a lot of these programs are prescribing specific  practices.  So for example, you know, I don't want to pick on Vera, but Vera has a set of practices  
**[0:22:46-0:22:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:22:46):**  that they lay out for, um, you know, agricultural land management, improvement, cover cropping,  no-till that you need to adopt within a certain time period and you need to continue doing  it.  
**[0:22:59-0:23:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:22:59):**  And there's other things that you can, um, you can add on over time, like, you know,  planting a native perennial grasses.  Um, if you want to do kind of livestock integration, that also, you know, that's okay.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:23:12):**  But a lot of these carbon programs are really based on adoption of specific practices.  So it's understanding that you're going to need to continue these practices.  If you stop them, you're not going to be paid for your carbon.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:23:24):**  So understanding if that's really feasible with your land, um, understanding if that's  something you want to do, um, you know, that that's really important.  I feel like a lot of these programs are pretty aggressive, um, when pursuing landowners.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:23:37):**  So they might think it's okay.  And with a lot of averages, you know, if they have a churn rate of, you know, 10 landowners  when they have 10 million acres, I don't think they really care.  
**[0:23:46-0:24:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:23:46):**  Um, but it, you know, as the person signing the contract on the other end, you know, you  might be on the hook.  Um, if you don't really think through what's feasible, um, on your end, um, you know, carbon  
**[0:24:01-0:24:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:24:01):**  credits right now, you know, right now we're selling it between 25 and $30 a ton.  Um, you can check that out on our website if you want to double check me.  Um, and you know, I think that's a premium price in the market right now, especially  
**[0:24:19-0:24:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:24:19):**  compared to a lot of the, like I said, avoided emission credits you can get, but thinking  about the cost of transition, um, you know, some equipment might be harder to get in certain  areas if you're doing things like buying certain seeds and you're going to need to buy hay,  
**[0:24:34-0:24:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:24:34):**  and you're going to need to change the entire kind of structure of your fencing and water  and your whole infrastructure, you know, really understand what it's going to cost, um, and  understand whether it's worth it or not.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:24:47):**  And maybe it might make sense, you know, I hate to say this, but maybe it might make  sense to wait a few years until you have a better understanding of the market.  Um, the, the major reason why folks don't get into carbon markets, and I'm drawing this  
**[0:24:59-0:25:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:24:59):**  from a series of polls that AgriPulse did, um, of ranchers, it's because of a lack of  trust in the market.  Um, and I think that's totally understandable.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:25:08):**  Um, so yeah, so just kind of like being aware of the unit economics is really key.  Um, something that, that that's important that is mentioned is certain folks are paying  farmers a fixed rate for these practices.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:25:20):**  So some might be saying you're going to get $9 if you adopt no till and cover cropping.  Um, but you know, the price is going to go up every year, especially as you inch towards  the compliance market.

I don't think that there's a golden number there.  I think it really varies.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:25:41):**  Um, you know, I think at the very least a large majority of that should be going to  the landowner, but don't, don't get locked into a certain sort of fixed rate agreement  unless, you know, there's a really specific reason why, um, which they could be paying  
**[0:25:57-0:26:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:25:57):**  above the price of the credit or, you know, they've explained the unit economics fall.  Um, and it's also important, um, you know, there's this bill going through that passed  the Senate, it's going through the house right now called the growing climate solutions act.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:26:11):**  Um, you know, the government's going to be involved in regulating the voluntary, uh,  soil carbon world.  So they should have an answer as to one, what's the government doing to what's their role  
**[0:26:22-0:26:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:26:22):**  in it.  And three, what do they think about it?  Um, the great climate solutions act is essentially built to defend landowners.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:26:29):**  Um, the whole idea is, you know, we don't want folks being preyed upon.  How can we protect them from, uh, from folks that will just kind of want to suck them into  these carbon programs and then use up, um, you know, kind of like build them into, to  
**[0:26:46-0:27:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:26:46):**  kind of, uh, a system, uh, that kind of has like a vicious cycle built into it.  Um, so how can you kind of like, you know, grapple with that?  So what do you guys think of the growing on solutions app is a question I always definitely  
**[0:27:02-0:27:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:27:02):**  ask if you're interested in a carbon program.  Um, I'm pretty libertarian, so you might not want to know what I think about government.  So shoot away.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:27:13):**  I mean, it's, it's worse.  It's, it's definitely worth discussing because there have been a few carbon markets in the  past that are totally voluntary.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:27:22):**  Um, we have the Chicago climate exchange, um, was the big one.  So it's like, what really is the best structure for this is it's, it's a totally open question  right now, Brian.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:27:33):**  And I think it's not settled, you know, I think it's really worth, you know, debating  and duking it out.  Yeah.  
**[0:27:41-0:28:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:27:41):**  It, you know, I don't have a real sound background in government policy and you know, it's kind  of a little, that stuff's a little bit over my pay grade.  And I, I'm not real familiar with, uh, with all the finer points of the plan, but from  
**[0:28:00-0:28:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:28:00):**  what I have read, it seems like they want to spend a bunch of money and they've got  some goals, but they're not real sure how they're going to get there.  And you know, maybe, maybe we do need a legislative definition of a credit.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:28:13):**  Maybe we do need some legislative framework for a carbon market to, to keep things fair.  But then I worry about, you know, the, the, the over the tendency of federal government  to kind of take over things and pick winners and pick losers and set a floor of entry and  
**[0:28:33-0:28:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:28:33):**  keep the small players out and deal that leads to continuing concentration.  I worry about that happening.  Um, you know, I did see something come out of the white house this morning and I post  
**[0:28:48-0:29:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:28:48):**  on Facebook about it, about that, that the current administration, I almost can't even  say a name.  The current administration is, is going to go after the meat packers.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:29:00):**  They're going to look into the meat packers and the concentration in the meat packing  industry.  And gosh, I don't know.  
**[0:29:08-0:29:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:29:08):**  I don't know if that really scares me or if I'm really encouraged about it.  Uh, I we'll just have to see where it goes and kind of the same thing with the growing  climate solutions act, you know?  
**[0:29:23-0:29:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:29:23):**  Yeah.  We need to settle the wild west down of the carbon market.  There's there's going to be a carbon gold rush and maybe we do need to have some fair  
**[0:29:33-0:29:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:29:33):**  standards on what, what good credits are and what credits might not be so good.  You know, I have a lot of faith, obviously in soil works, natural capital and a grassroots  carbon.  
**[0:29:46-0:30:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:29:46):**  Um, you know, and I'm really encouraged because, you know, you guys want to take a three foot  core on the B carbon standard and that's a lot different than trying to estimate it from  a satellite or, you know, go out and take a six inch soil core.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:30:00):**  That's so there is some wild west aspect to it.  So maybe some standardization is, is, is necessary, but how do we get there without picking winners  and losers?  
**[0:30:15-0:30:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:30:15):**  Um, I mean, that's, that's a, you know, that's a million dollar question.  Um, I guess from a policy perspective, you know, standardization is important on the  carbon side.  
**[0:30:31-0:30:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:30:31):**  Um, because there's always the possibility of fraud.  There's the possibility that a credit that someone buys, um, ends up being worthless.  And then what do they do if they spend all this money on carbon credits and it ends up  
**[0:30:45-0:30:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:30:45):**  being, uh, where it's nothing if literally the credits are, you know, up in smoke and  fire, um, as unfortunately a lot of forestry credits are not a lot.  There's just a few projects for the, you know, the entire acreage of  
**[0:30:58-0:31:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:30:58):**  What did they think was eventually going to happen to those forest?  Like what did they think was eventually going to happen to them?  Yeah, I mean, that's, it's a good question.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:31:07):**  I mean, the risks are there and there are like these buffer pools and, you know, it's  all kind of like modeled out financially.  It's, it is thought out.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:31:14):**  It's not like these aren't conservative estimates, but I don't think folks thought that the entire  project boundary was going to go up in flames.  Um, and that's really unfortunate for everyone involved.  
**[0:31:25-0:31:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:31:25):**  Um, you know, but what you mentioned about the cores is important because, you know,  you need to stop thinking of soil carbon as being this like bank vault where the carbon  just goes in and then it's stored forever.  
**[0:31:40-0:31:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:31:40):**  It's a part of the living, breathing ecosystem.  You know, it's like a growing flow model where it's just about accumulating the most, uh,  carbon at scale that cycles through the soil.  
**[0:31:52-0:32:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:31:52):**  Um, and some of that will be deposited deeper and deeper.  You only see that if you actually measure it deeper and deeper.  You know, satellites can penetrate a bit of the soil on the top soil, but it really won't  
**[0:32:02-0:32:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:32:02):**  go through.  And, and the deeper the storage generally the more permanent, correct?  Yes, generally speaking.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:32:11):**  So, you know, it's, it's the deeper the horizon.  Um, yes, you know, and we don't even know what really goes on beyond a meter deep because  there, I mean, that data was so expensive to collect.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:32:22):**  I wonder, you know, there's, there's, there's some good money to be made for folks leaving  the oil and gas industry that have these really expensive rigs to just go deep.  Um, you know, a couple of meters deeper than we do.  
**[0:32:33-0:32:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:32:33):**  Um, but you know, there's also, you know, you're talking about a processing bottleneck.  Uh, there's a soil lab testing bottleneck.  The economics of lab testing also changes it and then it takes a lot of time.  
**[0:32:46-0:32:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:32:46):**  Um, and there's just, you know, not that many places in the U S that have the capacity to  really handle commercial, uh, you know, uh, so carbon testing, especially for these larger  cores.  
**[0:32:59-0:33:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:32:59):**  So there's just a lot more processing on the field because you need to either break it  up on the field or send these intact cores and then they have to do a lot more, um, I  think more dangerous sort of work, kind of like chopping up the cores, dividing it and  
**[0:33:13-0:33:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:33:13):**  using exercise and professional judgment a lot more than they're used to because that's  different than you just using a, you know, a normal little, I don't even know what the  instruments called the pro thank you, a pro to just like break it in.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:33:26):**  And we're here, you know, sometimes the soil is so dry, you can't even use those, um, without  throwing out your back.  So it's difficult, but you know, I guess, you know, will, you know, will the government  
**[0:33:38-0:33:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:33:38):**  solve this problem on its own?  No.  Um, you know, with soil carbon, I think providing some general, um, you know, guidance on what's  
**[0:33:51-0:34:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:33:51):**  out of bounds, I think is useful because I think that'll protect people from fraud.  I think it'll protect the industry from, you know, being illegitimate before it even gets  started.  
**[0:34:02-0:34:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:34:02):**  Um, and I think that, you know, maybe some, you know, uh, again, the key focus of this  bill seems to be on protecting the landowners and farmers and ranchers.  There is even an advisory council for the kind of the formation of whatever comes out  
**[0:34:16-0:34:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:34:16):**  of it that I think 16 of the 25 people on it will be folks who own land.  Uh, it'll be folks that are running and operating the land.  It won't be, uh, folks in government and it won't be folks in kind of the agribusiness  
**[0:34:30-0:34:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:34:30):**  value chain.  Um, so that's something to consider.  Um, I think, you know, meat processing is, is its own issue and I have no idea what's  
**[0:34:41-0:34:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:34:41):**  actually going to come out from it, but I think scrutiny is good.  Um, you know, you, you need transparency at least.  Um, and if that's something that can be forced through government, I think that's important.  
**[0:34:55-0:35:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:34:55):**  Um, it doesn't necessarily mean that, you know, the government will unlock the solutions  on its own, but providing transparency in most markets is important to a free market  functioning as it should.  
**[0:35:09-0:35:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:35:09):**  So we're, you know, we're talking about free markets and you just brought up the cattle  market, which got me going on to price discovery and, and true price reporting.  We don't have any of that in carbon markets at all.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:35:22):**  No, there's, there's a couple folks that are doing good work, you know, trying to uncover  it, but no, not at all.  And you know, even, even if you're a buyer that does due diligence, it's really hard  
**[0:35:37-0:35:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:35:37):**  to, uh, to have kind of true understanding of price discovery and what market prices  are, um, unless it really in the know.  And even that's based on word of mouth, not some sort of financial mechanism and past  
**[0:35:50-0:36:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:35:50):**  price discovery, you know, not all credits being created equally because there's, you  know, there's avoidance credits, compliance credits.  Um, you know, there's, there's credits that maybe have more permanence.  
**[0:36:03-0:36:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:36:03):**  Is there maybe a need for something like a carbon credit rating system or carbon credit  score?  Yeah.  
**[0:36:11-0:36:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:36:11):**  I mean, I think that's, it's a great, you know, that's, it's a great point.  Um, so, so something I want to mention before I forget into that is that when, you know,  when I was talking about what a carbon credit is, is it is something that functionally should  
**[0:36:24-0:36:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:36:24):**  be commoditized with these registries, all the credits in the same registry are equal.  Um, they're supposed to have equal works.  They're equally retireable.  
**[0:36:32-0:36:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:36:32):**  So, you know, if my company emits, I don't know, a hundred thousand tons of carbon dioxide,  I'm going to need to buy whatever the equivalent of a hundred thousand tons of carbon dioxide  is to offset it.  
**[0:36:48-0:36:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:36:48):**  So I can buy these junk credits and say, and even if they're, you know, with the reputable  registry, I can say, I'm buying these, they're in a reputable registry.  I'm carbon neutral.  
**[0:36:59-0:37:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:36:59):**  I get all the good press, even if the credits are, um, honestly not what they should be  versus paying a bit more and protecting myself a bit and actually doing it.  Because in the end, if my end goal is just to say that I'm carbon neutral or I'm supporting  
**[0:37:14-0:37:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:37:14):**  a certain project, then, you know, you can do that with strong credits.  So I think finding a way to make it commoditized in the future is going to be really important,  even though the externalities like the biodiversity benefits and the water benefits and, you know,  
**[0:37:30-0:37:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:37:30):**  supporting, uh, farmers and ranchers and, you know, local projects, which is a big thing.  I think it's really important.  Honestly.  
**[0:37:37-0:37:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:37:37):**  Um, the key thing for carbon markets is to find a way to make it commoditized.  Um, but when things get, when things get commoditized though, they have a tendency to get centralized  and generally the producer share has a tendency to go down over time after something becomes  
**[0:37:54-0:38:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:37:54):**  commoditized.  How could, how would the car, how could a carbon market protect the producers from that?  No, that's a, that's a good question because the carbon markets aren't designed to protect  
**[0:38:08-0:38:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:38:08):**  the producers.  Um, because if you're thinking about it, you know, you can have a carbon market from, you  know, cook stoves in Kenya is kind of the, the quintessential idea that you give folks  
**[0:38:18-0:38:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:38:18):**  these certain types of cook stoves that don't pollute as much, or you pay people not to  kind of, uh, burn land in Africa when they're doing their, their land management.  Um, I, I'm not sure I have an answer to that, to be honest.  
**[0:38:37-0:38:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:38:37):**  I think it's a very valid, and it's a really valid question.  Um, it's okay.  You don't have an answer.

It just kind of jumped into my head.  Yeah, no, um, I mean, and it's worth lingering on though, because it's like, well, what happens  
**[0:38:56-0:39:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:38:56):**  in 10 years, you know, right now you might change the unit economics for folks searching  to regenerative, um, you know, what happens in 10 years?  Um, who's really going to have power in the market and how can you make sure it doesn't  
**[0:39:07-0:39:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:39:07):**  necessarily go to the middleman, but it goes to the people actually doing the work on the  ground or, you know, the folks, you know, look, I think so.  Carbon is going to be a major, um, protector I'd say of, of ecosystems.  
**[0:39:23-0:39:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:39:23):**  Um, as you know, we go through these extreme weather events and there'll be an important  tool, um, in, in, in fighting kind of, uh, fighting climate change.  Um, but we're going to need other things as well.  
**[0:39:37-0:39:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:39:37):**  We're going to need a portfolio of diverse solutions.  Um, so, so it's important to know that the market will always include a variety of projects.  I didn't think so.  
**[0:39:46-0:40:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:39:46):**  Carbon's the sweet spot because it has a scale it's a natural.  So you have all these other benefits and it will support these people.  Um, yeah, I hadn't really thought about, you know, like what the market's going to look  
**[0:40:00-0:40:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:40:00):**  like in 10 years, because I think, you know, there's a possibility that the market is even  developed for a soil apartment for that long, because there's still all these questions  that need to be figured out.  
**[0:40:09-0:40:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:40:09):**  And, um, you know, there's, there's these debates going on about permanence and, you  know, folks that have a really strong engineering mindset really kind of critique soil carbon  because it isn't again as permanent or as, you know, a to B to C as other forms of carbon  
**[0:40:28-0:40:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:40:28):**  offsetting.  We're going to suck it out of the atmosphere, using a lot of fossil fuel energy, compress  it pump at 6,000 feet underground and inject it into a rock and hope it stays there forever.  
**[0:40:40-0:40:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:40:40):**  That's exactly it.  Yeah, yeah.  And like, my thing is like, we just needed like really, really own the storytelling part  
**[0:40:49-0:41:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:40:49):**  of like what you're saying, Kevin is, is there's other added benefits that we're not even commoditizing,  like cleaner water, wildlife conservation, and actually like healthier, a healthier food  system.  
**[0:41:02-0:41:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:41:02):**  Right.  So I think these things that we all kind of just know by being in this world that we are  in, but, but I do, I do think we just kind of have to be really good about telling the  
**[0:41:12-0:41:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:41:12):**  story on why this nature based solution is better than these engineered solutions, even  though it may be more direct data.  I don't know.  
**[0:41:25-0:41:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:41:25):**  Yeah.  No, I mean, I love these solutions.  I don't, you know, there's these, a lot of these companies are delivering on their promises  
**[0:41:31-0:41:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:41:31):**  to suck it out of the atmosphere, but it's at $600 a ton.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[0:41:37-0:41:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:41:37):**  I mean, you know, there's the CEO of grassroots, uh, Hank, he likes to use this quote from,  from Albert Einstein.  We can't solve problems by using the same kind of thing.  
**[0:41:45-0:41:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:41:45):**  Can we use when we created them?  And that's really stuck with me just kind of thinking about like, how do you fight climate  change?  
**[0:41:52-0:42:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:41:52):**  Like, you know, there's this effect with grasslands, it's called the grasslands cooling effect  and folks don't really talk about, there's some academic literature on it, but literally  having healthy grasslands, not only does it, you know, sequester soil carbon, but it actually  
**[0:42:03-0:42:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:42:03):**  results in a cooler, more temperate environment.  And it's like, well, how can we get that at scale?  You know, shouldn't, you know, grasslands, you know, prairie restoration be a key focus  
**[0:42:14-0:42:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:42:14):**  then as opposed to just carbon reductionism, no carbon reductionism is a very, very dangerous  way of thinking about this.  Yeah.  
**[0:42:22-0:42:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:42:22):**  Um, yeah.  And I, you know, I think that's something that, that lends itself to grazing as well  in particular, you know, with, with grazing, you're kind of, you know, I feel like as I've  
**[0:42:33-0:42:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:42:33):**  understand it, if you're doing it in a regenerative way, or if you're really trying to be a, a  land steward, you're going to foster kind of a biodiverse ecosystem.  Um, and you're thinking about how you can do that.  
**[0:42:47-0:43:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:42:47):**  Some sort of at scale is really a key solution.  And you know, I really wonder if, you know, you know, one of the key critiques of regenerative  that I've seen, um, both, you know, economically and from a policy perspective is that it takes  
**[0:43:01-0:43:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:43:01):**  like 2.5 times more land to have the same level of output.  Um, I'm not sure if that's true, first of all, that's just extrapolating from specific  studies.  
**[0:43:10-0:43:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:43:10):**  But second of all, it's like the land that they're on, they're not damaging.  So, so what if you need more land to do it?  Um, shouldn't that be something that, you know, policies geared towards, why don't we  
**[0:43:18-0:43:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:43:18):**  have, um, more cattle or, you know, bison, I'm not, you know, I'm not a bison guy, but  some people are like, why don't we have, you know, these ruminants on lands where they  can help restore the ecosystem and they won't be doing damage.  
**[0:43:30-0:43:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:43:30):**  Um, or, you know, you know, using less land for corn and soybean feed, you know, why doesn't  that land be readopted into sort of this cycle of restoring grasslands?  Oh, cause the government's paying farmers to destroy their crops.  
**[0:43:43-0:43:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:43:43):**  Have you seen that one?  I'm just kidding.  I mean that, I don't think that was a real thing, but you know, there's like up in the  
**[0:43:52-0:44:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:43:52):**  corn belt, like the general sentiment is, Oh great.  There's carbon payments.  Oh, I sequester a half a ton or maybe a ton of acre a year.  
**[0:44:01-0:44:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:44:01):**  Oh, I'm going to get paid.  I'm going to keep doing what I'm doing with all this tillage.  And I think that that's kind of a, you know, like if you sample at the same time every  
**[0:44:11-0:44:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:44:11):**  year, you might get the same number, but does that, or are you really building up any long-term  storage you plowing it up?  And is that ton cycling every year?  
**[0:44:20-0:44:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:44:20):**  You know, so I, again, we're kind of like back to the quality of credits.  Like how is there going to be a level playing field?  So the buyers know that they've got good quality credits.  
**[0:44:33-0:44:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:44:33):**  And so the sellers know, and you know, the land managers, I guess the managers, the people  that are doing the work have something to work towards to have a high quality credit  to sell that's worth more than a credit that's say valid in a tillage type system.  
**[0:44:49-0:44:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:44:49):**  Yeah.  So there's been a couple of interesting studies in this space in particular.  One of them was done by a group called carbon plan.  
**[0:44:59-0:45:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:44:59):**  And Microsoft essentially funded a study that said, hey, look at all the protocols that  is all the different link methodologies set up by third parties with regards to solar  carbon.  
**[0:45:13-0:45:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:45:13):**  So grassroots, for example, wasn't on that list, but the carbon, the registry that we're  using was.  And I think they found a total of 14.  
**[0:45:21-0:45:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:45:21):**  And their main conclusion was, look, this is a developing space.  The best sort of the best protocols are those which do rigorous measurements.  They need to be based in ground truth measurements and which provide a lot of kind of safeguards  
**[0:45:38-0:45:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:45:38):**  to buyers and really value permanence and doing the soil science.  But buyer beware.  Buyers need to do their own diligence.  
**[0:45:50-0:46:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:45:50):**  There is no standardization in sort of that due diligence process yet.  You know, the soil science part is really key.  I think that the carbon plan explanation is really valuable for understanding.  
**[0:46:03-0:46:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:46:03):**  You know, if I'm if I'm getting a credit that follows the I don't want to call it a particular  part of all, but if I'm following that follows the let's do the B carbon or the Vera zero  zero to wonder the food and agriculture organization methodologies.  
**[0:46:20-0:46:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:46:20):**  Those three are like, oh, well, they're doing everything right.  According to the science.  And if they're following the protocols out with regards to measurement and reporting  
**[0:46:29-0:46:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:46:29):**  and following on with those methodologies, they're doing it right.  So that's a good signal.  But you should always keep on doing it.  
**[0:46:37-0:46:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:46:37):**  You know, an issue with with nature based solutions is that you are working with landowners.  You know, there's it's not an added risk, but you're working with human beings.  And I feel like something that people like about these engineered solutions, it's like,  
**[0:46:49-0:46:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:46:49):**  well, they're working with the factory and they understand a factory.  And as long as they're paying the factory to just suck down carbon, they're going to  keep doing that.  
**[0:46:58-0:47:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:46:58):**  And 10 guys work there and it contributes this to the local economy.  Exactly.  Exactly.  
**[0:47:04-0:47:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:47:04):**  And as opposed to just trying to help, you know, a community of ranchers.  And yeah, you know, I do think that's a key risk.  You know, the carbon credits have their own internal metrics outside of the science.  
**[0:47:23-0:47:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:47:23):**  So some of these terms, the first one's permanent.  So you've talked about solar carbon as its own permanent risks.  Second is this thing called leakage.  
**[0:47:31-0:47:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:47:31):**  So let's say I am a producer and I'm producing, I don't know, let's say I have 100 cattle.  And what happens is I say, I'm going to sign up for one of these programs, but in order  to do so, I need to change my practices.  
**[0:47:50-0:47:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:47:50):**  And therefore, if I change my practices, I'm actually only going to be able to have 50  head of cattle, or let's say, you know, it's at a certain weight.  So why don't we do weight?  
**[0:47:59-0:48:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:47:59):**  So let's say we have a, you know, a thousand pounds of ground beef.  If we have to cut that in half, what folks want to know is where is the other 500 pounds  being produced now?  
**[0:48:15-0:48:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:48:15):**  Is that just going to be produced in a feedlot now?  Or some sort of CAFO system that's actually not good for the environment?  So in reality, you're not actually helping things out.  
**[0:48:26-0:48:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:48:26):**  Then there's a leakage discount taken.  I'm not sure the exact percentage, and it's not going to discount your project.  The whole idea is, you know, you don't want to just shift production, either to other  
**[0:48:37-0:48:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:48:37):**  countries or to other companies that will end up still harming the environment.  I think that makes a lot of sense.  I think it sucks for producers that, you know, they can't control that in many cases.  
**[0:48:46-0:48:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:48:46):**  But it also means that if you're a big agribusiness, for example, and you want to get into the  carbon credit game, you can't just like say, Oh, everywhere, everything we do in the US  is going to be super regenerative.  
**[0:48:56-0:49:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:48:56):**  And then they just move everything to, you know, another country where they'll just like  intensify their production even more.  Yeah, everything in the US is going to be regenerative.  
**[0:49:05-0:49:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:49:05):**  And they sell everything down to one farm and move it all back to Brazil or Nigeria,  wherever.  And there's key risks there.  
**[0:49:14-0:49:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:49:14):**  And the third one is this term called additionality, which is essentially, you know, at its core  of it means is people are getting paid for their carbon credit for a specific practice.  So essentially, the payment of the carbon credit needs to incentivize the practice.  
**[0:49:39-0:49:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:49:39):**  In particular, a lot of these carbon registries emphasize the idea of a practice change.  So only if I've changed practices within the past two or three years with the motive of  getting paid for carbon credit, will I be allowed to be paid for carbon credit.  
**[0:49:57-0:50:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:49:57):**  We're explicitly using a different idea of additionality.  So we're using this concept of measured additionality, which is essentially that, you know, regenerative  land management is a series of decisions.  
**[0:50:10-0:50:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:50:10):**  It's not linear.  Sometimes you will be forced to take decisions that you don't want to take, because you feel  it's what's best for your land and you're being rational about it.  
**[0:50:21-0:50:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:50:21):**  So only at that point where we're measuring in that land and you've signed your contract  or started measuring everything, are you really bound to do those things?  So the fact that you've been a good land steward for the past five years, 10 years, 15 years,  
**[0:50:38-0:50:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:50:38):**  that shouldn't be held against you.  There shouldn't be a harm against you for being an early adopter.  It's contentious because it's like, well, you know, I think the argument that would  
**[0:50:51-0:51:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:50:51):**  be made if I'm getting kind of in my carbon credit critic hat, it would be, well, what  change are you actually leading to?  You're just paying someone to keep doing the same practices that they were doing.  
**[0:51:06-0:51:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:51:06):**  And I think that's a fair critique, but then I think there's two rebuttals.  The first is one, you're trying to catalyze change.  The people that are most likely to keep on doing regenerative practices are the folks

And if you can say, hey, these guys deserve to be paid for what they've done and they  will lead other people to start getting, like, yeah, exactly.  
**[0:51:31-0:51:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:51:31):**  So I think that's a valuable argument and there is evidence.  So I kind of was doing research into other carbon markets, other carbon registries do  have kind of these fairly adopted clauses.  
**[0:51:43-0:51:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:51:43):**  So that's one reason.  The second is, again, you know, we're not really taking this prescriptive practice approach  where you need to have a certain number of rotations and do certain things in your paddock  
**[0:51:55-0:52:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:51:55):**  and have a certain number of cattle or, you know, apply a certain microbial seed coating  to your grasses and do XYZ grasses so that we can model it out.  And because we're not doing that, it's more important to really say, one, what a farmer  
**[0:52:18-0:52:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:52:18):**  rancher can't do, which is really to disturb soil health, no till, no application of certain  synthetic fertilizers.  And two, really kind of just say, like, look, you know, you had the option beforehand if  
**[0:52:32-0:52:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:52:32):**  you wanted to be regenerative or conventional or anything in the spectrum.  Now, you know, this is you making a covenant in a way, a legal covenant to keep on doing  these practices and to keep on following through until the duration of this contract is over.  
**[0:52:49-0:52:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:52:49):**  So it's just a different way of thinking about it.  I feel like you need to change the paradigm to really make this scale because right now  it's so landowner unfriendly.  
**[0:52:57-0:53:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:52:57):**  Right.  So what happens if I sign a contract and the price is, say, you know, low 20s and in two  years that price is 50 bucks per credit?  
**[0:53:11-0:53:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:53:11):**  That's why you want a percentage of it.  You want it to be listed out as a percentage.  You don't want it to be listed out necessarily as I'm going to get $9 per credit until the  
**[0:53:20-0:53:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:53:20):**  duration of this contract is over.  I think, you know, we don't really you know, there's all these studies done on what the  prices of credits will be.  
**[0:53:30-0:53:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:53:30):**  We don't really know what it will be.  But there is a there's not enough credits to meet demand currently.  And demand isn't even that high because most companies are selling they're doing like,  
**[0:53:41-0:53:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:53:41):**  you know, small purchases to say, oh, look, we've started looking in.  They're starting to build out their teams.  They're starting to, you know, these big oil and gas producers and folks kind of in the  
**[0:53:51-0:54:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:53:51):**  commodity space are starting to build out their trading desks and sort of scout out  like what it's going to look like when this really scales.  But that's why I say like, always try and get a percentage as opposed to get locked  
**[0:54:06-0:54:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:54:06):**  into a price.  You know, we're talking about price reporting earlier, and it's not easy to dig up what  the price of carbon is per credit.  
**[0:54:18-0:54:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:54:18):**  You know, we're talking about carbon prices in the low 20s now for you know, for the US  market for the B carbon credit, which is probably a pretty high quality deal.  Mechanical capture.  
**[0:54:31-0:54:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:54:31):**  I've read some articles that suggest that that's in the 50 to $60 a ton range.  And Bill Gates, you know, about six months ago, right before we came out, right before  we started doing this, CK, he came out with this book.  
**[0:54:45-0:55:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:54:45):**  And he said that he paid between 600 and $1,200 a ton for his 2020 offsets.  So like, there's such a wide range of price.  You know, yeah, you got Bill Gates at one end at 1200 bucks.  
**[0:55:00-0:55:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:55:00):**  I mean, he probably doesn't even know what he bought.  He probably doesn't even care.  He's got so much money.  
**[0:55:05-0:55:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:55:05):**  You got guys like Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson and what's another one?  Oh, Elon Musk, flying rocket ships around.  Are they, you know, what are they going to start paying for some offsets on that?  
**[0:55:16-0:55:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:55:16):**  I don't know.  I want to get some SpaceX offset credits.  That's what I want.  
**[0:55:20-0:55:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:55:20):**  We applied to that, right, Kevin?  Didn't we apply to that SpaceX thing?  Oh no, the X prize?  
**[0:55:29-0:55:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:55:29):**  No, we haven't done that yet.  That's like the moonshot solution where you just want, I think he wants to give a hundred  million dollars to something that can remove one gigaton of carbon every year.  
**[0:55:40-0:55:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:55:40):**  Which is, you know, which is awesome.  But you're asking what's the 600 to $1,200?  That's the direct air capture stuff that's sucking it out of the atmosphere.  
**[0:55:51-0:56:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:55:51):**  And again, that's an engineered way of thinking.  And it's, you know, that's, that's a lot of money.  You know, I'd say the average price of an offset right now, I'd say it's between five  
**[0:56:02-0:56:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:56:02):**  and $10.  These, it's all this, you know, these, these older avoidance credits.  If you want it to buy in for pennies on the dollar, you can buy them for pennies on the  
**[0:56:10-0:56:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:56:10):**  dollar if they're older.  So that's what's the story in the market that, you know, it's, it's at face value, it's commoditized.  And if I'm a small company and I hire some sort of, you know, some sort of consultant,  
**[0:56:24-0:56:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:56:24):**  I'll say, this is the price range, this is our budget.  These are the kinds of projects who like, get me the lowest priced ones.  A lot of these big companies with a lot of PR, you know, they're really investing in  
**[0:56:35-0:56:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:56:35):**  high quality stories on mainly on, you know, tech oil and gas.  A lot of, I think 1% of all carbon credits are bought by universities, which is interesting.  So, so those people are really involved, but it really varies in terms of buyer preference.  
**[0:56:51-0:56:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:56:51):**  And that really distorts it.  Unfortunately.  I forgot where I was going to go.  
**[0:56:59-0:57:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:56:59):**  I just, I just had it just a second ago.  Questions from the branching reboot, Patek?  We've got quite a few of them covered.  
**[0:57:08-0:57:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:57:08):**  A lot of them were kind of specific, like specific contract type questions.  Well, one guy asked, is it just a fad?  And you know, we can also, we can back that up.  
**[0:57:21-0:57:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:57:21):**  I wanted to circle back, Kevin.  You said that there's maybe a five to 10 year window to get in, but then you also made another  comment about maybe waiting a year or two to get in.  
**[0:57:31-0:57:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:57:31):**  So it is, how do we balance that out?  I mean, do we need, I didn't wait, obviously, but, and I wouldn't advise anybody else.  What would be a benefit of waiting to get into a carbon program?  
**[0:57:47-0:58:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:57:47):**  If you're a conventional farmer and you're interested in regenerative, you know, it's  interesting at this, this, this talk that Travis had me go to a bunch of the folks there  were still, you know, operating kind of more of a conventional mindset where, you know,  
**[0:58:09-0:58:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:58:09):**  they'd send them off to sort of centralized operation.  Thinking about when it makes sense for you to transition, when transition financing will  be available, when the price of carbon changing makes the most sense for you.  
**[0:58:28-0:58:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:58:28):**  That really matters.  You know, I think, I think it should be set up in a way that producers benefit economically  as opposed to, you know, struggling with cashflow.  
**[0:58:37-0:58:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:58:37):**  I feel like if you're already regenerative, there's very few programs that will support  you, but there's no harm in joining them because folks that are supporting early adopters,  in my opinion, the ones that will do so are already out there.  
**[0:58:53-0:59:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:58:53):**  But I'm thinking particularly about folks that are seeking to make a transition to regenerative  because it's hard on the grazing side in particular, I feel like there's very few programs out  there.  
**[0:59:03-0:59:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:59:03):**  It's in the US, you know, some folks sell credits from like Australia or Africa, but  we're really focused right now on American grasslands.  And I see the grasslands equation a little bit different.  
**[0:59:17-0:59:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:59:17):**  You know, I haven't been here to test.  I kind of have a hopeful number of where I think I'm at.  So let's just say like bottom barrel, somebody in a normal set stock Columbus style, non-rotation,  
**[0:59:34-0:59:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:59:34):**  doesn't ever really go look at them type stocking system.  If there's a question one ton an acre a year on their grasslands, just doing that and a  more regenerative system with, you know, animals in one herd, rotated daily or multiple times  
**[0:59:51-1:00:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=0:59:51):**  a day, moving across the landscape and getting appropriate rest, that number may go to something  more like four to five tons an acre.  And you know, when you're talking about 20 bucks a credit, you know, those numbers start  
**[1:00:06-1:00:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:00:06):**  to get real really, really fast.  I mean, and that could be like, that could be a catalyst for transition for a lot of  guys.  
**[1:00:15-1:00:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:00:15):**  You know, they can look at what they're getting now.  Okay, if I continue doing this, I'm going to sequester approximately one ton or one  credit an acre a year.  
**[1:00:25-1:00:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:00:25):**  If I do this, I can do four or five.  You know, that's, you know, and that's, it's also highly variable, Brian, your region,  your precipitation, soil type.  
**[1:00:39-1:00:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:00:39):**  Yeah, I get that.  I think you're right, though, you know, it is a potentially extremely lucrative opportunity.  There's just a there's very, I won't say there's no good models, but there's very few good  
**[1:00:53-1:01:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:00:53):**  models showing how soil carbon storage is done.  So if I'm a buyer, and you're telling me, you know, I'm going to have something based  on the model, as opposed to really unlocking the majority of those credits after year five,  
**[1:01:07-1:01:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:01:07):**  after a second measurement is done, and after, you know, you can verify that these practices  have been done for X number of years.  That changes things.  
**[1:01:17-1:01:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:01:17):**  And it's like, well, can you wait until year five for most of that money to arrive, you  know?  And again, I'll say it like most folks getting paid from carbon markets aren't getting paid  
**[1:01:27-1:01:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:01:27):**  $20 a ton yet.  I think I said, you know, I think that's a really attractive price point, though.  But you also need to think again, you know, you need to think about like, what's it going  
**[1:01:39-1:01:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:01:39):**  to cost for you to change your operation?  And can you, you know, can you agree to that change?  You know, I feel like there's, there's, I don't know, you know, feel like you guys have  
**[1:01:51-1:02:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:01:51):**  talked to more folks that are made to transition from conventional or generative than I have.  So you guys know better than I like, what are those barriers?  So I feel like, you know, the carbon incentive is really strong.  
**[1:02:00-1:02:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:02:00):**  I think it's really powerful.  Something that I think would be cooler is those that are running regenerative, finding  ways to, you know, acquire new land and finance it based on carbon credits.  
**[1:02:11-1:02:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:02:11):**  I think that'd be a really cool form of collateral.  But that's the other idea that's more exploratory.  That's a conversation I'd like to have with somebody that knows how to put money together.  
**[1:02:25-1:02:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:02:25):**  I know a couple of answers for sale.  Yeah, I mean, hey, you know, that's, you know, at this really pivotal time where there's  a generational transition in terms of farmland acquisition, and, you know, the rural demographics  
**[1:02:46-1:02:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:02:46):**  of America.  And, you know, there's a lot of foreign investment in American farmland right now.  There's a lot of corporate investment in American farmland right now.  
**[1:02:57-1:03:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:02:57):**  Do carbon credits change the unit economics for folks that do want to live out here?  For entrepreneurs that are like, well, you know, maybe this is more lucrative than, you  know, living the life that I'm living, doing XYZ, even just being a land steward and doing  
**[1:03:15-1:03:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:03:15):**  the carbon farming as opposed to necessarily trying to have the most productive, intensive  agriculture.  And I think, yes, I think a lot of folks are going to be attracted to that vision, even  
**[1:03:24-1:03:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:03:24):**  if it's just on, you know, I don't want to say even if it's on a couple hundred acres.  I think reducing barriers to landowners of that size entering is super duper important.  There are mechanisms to group folks, but they have to be so geographically close that it's  
**[1:03:43-1:03:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:03:43):**  hard because that's just not the norm, I feel like.  So unless you have like neighboring, not even neighboring, but like in kind of like the  same overall region, I haven't really seen that happen.  
**[1:03:56-1:04:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:03:56):**  They have to be very similar in soil type and other things too, right?  Which is just, we know that one corner of the ranch is totally different from the other  corner of the ranch.  
**[1:04:05-1:04:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:04:05):**  So, yeah.  Oh, and it varies highly by soil type.  You know, I might have 80% one type of soil in my neighbor that's right across the fence  
**[1:04:17-1:04:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:04:17):**  that we have two miles of fence with, he might only have 5% of that soil.  There's a lot of variability in it.  The science isn't there because the data is not there.  
**[1:04:30-1:04:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:04:30):**  The data hasn't been generated because we haven't had the science to measure it.  So it's kind of, we're almost at a chicken and egg point with the carbon market.  Like, well, we need this science.  
**[1:04:40-1:04:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:04:40):**  Well, we need this data.  Well, we need this market.  But all three of them are going to have to kind of coexist and grow together organically  
**[1:04:47-1:04:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:04:47):**  to develop properly.  Yeah.  The other thing I'll say is I think Cargill said that their carbon trading program is  
**[1:04:59-1:05:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:04:59):**  going to be larger than their, it's going to be more profitable than their feed trading  by 2030.  So a lot of these bigger players in the agriculture space, they have these programs, they're enrolling  
**[1:05:15-1:05:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:05:15):**  farmers, they're doing trials out in the West.  The Ecosystem Services Marketplace Consortium is kind of this group.  I think they're starting to enroll some pilot folks, but that's where a lot of the big agribusiness  
**[1:05:30-1:05:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:05:30):**  players are kind of thinking about.  But for them, there's still the R&D space.  That's not going to roll out until I think later next year.  
**[1:05:39-1:05:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:05:39):**  So really thinking about how to protect independent producers is something that I think is really  important to me because I'm not sure what would really happen within the agriculture  value chain moving forward in response to carbon markets.  
**[1:05:58-1:06:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:05:58):**  There's a lot of carbon credits generated from finding ways to reduce cow methane and  reducing cow farts and all that.  And it's like, well, what does that really solve?  
**[1:06:11-1:06:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:06:11):**  Do you do it by feeding them seaweed?  It's like, okay, great.  What does that do?  
**[1:06:17-1:06:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:06:17):**  And it's not really, it's like putting a bandaid on a much larger solution.  Quit feeding them corn and soybeans and they don't fart as much.  Yeah, exactly.  
**[1:06:26-1:06:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:06:26):**  You feed them grass.  Pasture cows, I don't know if methane is really that big of a deal for my pasture cows.  I would suspect that it's not.  
**[1:06:36-1:06:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:06:36):**  Yeah, well, yeah.  I mean, also there's a lot of soil microbes that interact with the manure and actually  just cycle the methane into the soil or consume it.  
**[1:06:50-1:07:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:06:50):**  So we don't need these really expensive digesters that you're still having people deal with  a bunch of waste.  It's just, it's better as kind of a natural fertilizer.  
**[1:07:00-1:07:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:07:00):**  And yeah, I mean, we can go into that.  That's all, you know, that's a whole nother discussion, but you know, again, you go back  to, you know, five or 10 years from now, what does it look like?  
**[1:07:12-1:07:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:07:12):**  There's a point that's related to this, which is, you know, right now when we're talking  about carbon credits, we're talking about offsets.  So it's people buying credits to offset their emissions, but there's this other rising idea  
**[1:07:24-1:07:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:07:24):**  that's called a carbon inset.  And what that means is, you know, folks that are producing these goods, adding a carbon  premium to that.  
**[1:07:34-1:08:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:07:34):**  So you know, if I am, you know, producing, let's say, you know, I have sequestered 5,000  tons of carbon in my ranch, just doing great practices, you know, kicking butt, I can attach  that if I'm selling all my product into some sort of supply chain, I can sell my product  
**[1:08:03-1:08:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:08:03):**  at a premium by adding that to the product.  So this is still kind of an experimental idea.  And the reason I bring that up is because I see two ways of carbon credits devolving,  
**[1:08:16-1:08:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:08:16):**  which is one selling these sort of carbon credits outside the agriculture value chain  and selling it inside.  And I think outside, there's some industries that will always need to buy offsets, but  
**[1:08:28-1:08:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:08:28):**  a lot of them should just decarbonize because the price is just going to be way too high  moving forward.  But within the value chain, I think there's always going to be a need for folks with a  
**[1:08:37-1:08:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:08:37):**  carbon premium.  So I think that's something to think about.  It's like, you know, if I have these measurements done, even if it's not certified by a registry,  
**[1:08:48-1:09:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:08:48):**  I can say, look, my food has a carbon negative footprint, and that means something.  For sure.  You made a comment about decarbonizing some industries.  
**[1:09:02-1:09:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:09:02):**  Let's circle back to that.  What were you talking about there?  So a lot of what companies are doing right now is they're literally just trying to figure  
**[1:09:12-1:09:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:09:12):**  out what their carbon footprint actually is.  So they have entire teams of 20, 30 people.  They're hiring all these super expensive consultants.  
**[1:09:19-1:09:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:09:19):**  Essentially, what they're trying to do is say, how much are we actually polluting?  You know, let's realize what we're actually doing to the land because they've never been  held to account for it.  
**[1:09:30-1:09:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:09:30):**  So they don't have any carbon account.  So what they're trying to do is they're trying to figure out what emissions are actually  core to their business.  
**[1:09:39-1:10:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:09:39):**  And you know, they'll need to keep emitting in order to function or honestly stay profitable  because in the end, these companies are still putting profits before sustainability.  And second is what emissions can they cut down and can they save money doing so?  
**[1:10:00-1:10:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:10:00):**  And can they do other things?  Can they improve the quality of their products?  Can they improve their design or whatever and be more efficient with all these things?  
**[1:10:09-1:10:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:10:09):**  In the end right now, you know, I think a lot of these companies do have a sense, like  a fair amount of these companies do have a sense of sort of common good.  I think a lot of CEOs feel the need to step up to the plate and some sort of corporate  
**[1:10:23-1:10:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:10:23):**  responsibility, but it's also really good marketing.  And it's also a really good story to tell from their products to relate to consumers  that, you know, you know, we changed our product to be more efficient, to have less carbon  
**[1:10:37-1:10:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:10:37):**  in the production of it and use different materials.  They might be recycled or compostable or whatever.  And I think you're going to be hearing a lot about that.  
**[1:10:48-1:11:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:10:48):**  What's interesting there is, you know, what incentives will drive decarbonization?  So are folks going to do it on their own or if they're forced to offset, what price is  high enough that they will be like, holy crap, we can't pay this much for carbon credits.  
**[1:11:09-1:11:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:11:09):**  We need to change now.  So I think that's kind of the gentle push that carbon credits provide that we don't  know about yet because we don't have a mandatory market.  
**[1:11:23-1:11:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:11:23):**  Consumers are like, even in mandatory markets, because credits are commoditized, if you're  really just concerned with profits, you're just going to buy the cheapest credits out  there.  
**[1:11:32-1:11:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:11:32):**  So there's always, you know, there's always ways around it.  It's just not the best look.  You know, CK mentioned greenwashing before.  
**[1:11:42-1:11:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:11:42):**  The truth is, I really wonder how many consumers out there that buy specific products even  know what greenwashing is or care about greenwashing.  A lot of folks care about sustainability, but I feel like a lot of the sustainability  
**[1:11:55-1:12:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:11:55):**  pledges are super easy to make because they're pledges.  You know, they're not necessarily actions right now.  Kind of like a lot of the pledges to be renewable or reduce their carbon emissions that a lot  
**[1:12:07-1:12:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:12:07):**  of businesses have made in the last 18 months.  And some of it just doesn't seem very realistic.  You know, and my question is, like, how are these emissions calculated?  
**[1:12:19-1:12:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:12:19):**  Like, are we calculating the lifecycle of the product or just what comes into the factory  and what they produce and what they consume?  Or are we taking things all the way back to the raw material stage?  
**[1:12:31-1:12:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:12:31):**  Yeah, no, that's a really, really good question.  So there's three scopes of emissions in carbon accounting.  And I use the, you know, you can think of carbon accounting as, you know, normal accounting.  
**[1:12:49-1:12:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:12:49):**  You have, you know, carbon that you're generating and then carbon that you can be offsetting  or you're buying credits from.  So that's the term that's used in the industry.  
**[1:12:56-1:13:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:12:56):**  So the first is scope one emissions.  Those are, you know, direct emissions from stuff that you own.  Scope two is kind of like indirect emissions from like, you know, electricity, heating,  
**[1:13:09-1:13:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:13:09):**  cooling, stuff like that, that you're kind of generating and that you kind of need.  Scope three is all indirect emissions that occur in a company's value chain.  So as I understand it from my research, scope three tends to dwarf scopes one and two.  
**[1:13:24-1:13:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:13:24):**  You know, if you're, so FedEx has bought solar carbon credits, not from us.  I forget who actually, but they bought solar carbon credits.  They probably paid too much.  
**[1:13:35-1:13:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:13:35):**  Hey, I don't know, but they, they, they must have like a massive footprint for, you know,  just their fleet overall.  How is it calculated?  
**[1:13:48-1:14:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:13:48):**  Well, there's a couple of different things.  One is what source of, of greenhouse gases, you know, if it's nitrous oxide, that's like,  is it, I think it's at least 200 times more potent.  
**[1:14:02-1:14:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:14:02):**  I think it could be 400 times more potent than carbon dioxide is.  Methane is considered more potent than carbon dioxide, but it is a much shorter life cycle.  I think it has a 12 year life cycle in our atmosphere.  
**[1:14:15-1:14:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:14:15):**  So it's cycled, you know, it might be more potent now, but it's cycled out a lot faster.  So a lot of this carbon accounting is transferring, you know, measuring those greenhouse gases  and transferring it over to carbon.  
**[1:14:26-1:14:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:14:26):**  It could be in the product's life cycle.  It could be also the delivery of the product.  I feel like this isn't a standardized space.  
**[1:14:34-1:14:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:14:34):**  There's a lot of startups just working in literally this, this idea of sort of sustainability  as a service.  A lot of these folks are also offering carbon credits as a solution, you know, saying, okay,  
**[1:14:44-1:14:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:14:44):**  you know, this is your carbon footprint.  This is where we think you can reduce.  And these are carbon credits that we think you should consider buying.  
**[1:14:52-1:15:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:14:52):**  So it's kind of like this full service thing, but it is far from a settled science.  And I'm not even sure we're ready to regulate it because I'm not sure the government will  have a template that's necessarily as settled as it should be either.  
**[1:15:09-1:15:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:15:09):**  So it's not standardized how we're accounting our emissions and calculating what our quote,  what our footprint is.  That's what I'm hearing you say.  
**[1:15:18-1:15:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:15:18):**  Well, it's just, it's, it's, it's a complex science.  It's there, you know, there's these scopes that you should follow.  There's things that you should account for in your inventory and there's guidance for  
**[1:15:29-1:15:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:15:29):**  it.  But, you know, I think two very smart people could look at the same company, um, get data  from a variety of scientific sources, interview the people there, come up with calculations  
**[1:15:46-1:15:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:15:46):**  and come up with two radically different numbers.  And I think that we need to have a tolerance for that.  I think feeling the need to say one's right over the other, isn't necessarily going to  
**[1:15:57-1:16:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:15:57):**  be the most productive outcome.  Because I just think the science needs to be more settled before we start strong-arming  people into certain directions.  
**[1:16:10-1:16:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:16:10):**  I see.  I see.  One of the questions that keeps gnawing on the back of my mind is, you know, like we're,  
**[1:16:22-1:16:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:16:22):**  we are on like the cusp of a generational shift in agriculture.  Oh God, we have to be like ever.  I've been, I came back from the Navy in 2006 and ever since then, the average age has just  
**[1:16:37-1:16:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:16:37):**  gone up.  I mean, I remember telling my, my good friend, Nate, you know, we've, we've run cattle together  now for 13 years.  
**[1:16:44-1:16:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:16:44):**  I remember telling my good friend, Nate, like 13 years ago, I was like, one of these days  we're going to be the old men.  Well, it's here.  
**[1:16:51-1:17:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:16:51):**  It's almost here, but the old men are still here and there's, there's still not any more.  There's just not any young people coming up.  And you know, we've got to get around this generational transition.  
**[1:17:05-1:17:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:17:05):**  And at the same time, we're grappling with carbon markets and try and reduce our emissions  and making this transition towards more regenerative local food systems.  We talk about, we've talked about how to make land more accessible to the next generation.  
**[1:17:20-1:17:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:17:20):**  And man, I, I just have this feeling that it is soon, real soon, carbon price on, on  grazing lands and potential for, you know, tillage ground farm ground.  When these things start becoming known over the next year or two, man, it could do some  
**[1:17:41-1:17:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:17:41):**  crazy things to land prices.  And you know, it could totally price out anybody coming into the market other than big corporate  interest wanting to buy up land.  
**[1:17:51-1:17:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:17:51):**  So they can sequester their own carbon.  Yeah.  Geez.

You know, I've kind of seen kind of on the soil work side.  You know, we, we see a lot of cool companies in their generative space.  
**[1:18:09-1:18:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:18:09):**  There's a lot of folks, um, trying to make farmland investing, um, possible for the retail  investors.  So that's, you know, the, the average person that has, uh, their savings and they're trying  
**[1:18:22-1:18:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:18:22):**  to find things to invest in.  So, you know, they can put a bit of money and have a percentage owned of the farm.  Um, so that's one potential solution.  
**[1:18:32-1:18:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:18:32):**  Is that the right one?  I'm not sure.  Um, I hope the operators of the land, uh, get, get appropriately compensated as well,  
**[1:18:42-1:18:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:18:42):**  because if not, what we're going to see is we're going to see, I mean, I'm not sure by  the way this model is going to work necessarily.  I just don't know enough, but what we're going to see is the rise of a lot of land owned  
**[1:18:53-1:19:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:18:53):**  by someone, but then operated by someone else or, you know, owned by a group of people owned  by these real estate investment trusts, uh, which I see popping up a lot, especially in  the regenerative space.  
**[1:19:05-1:19:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:19:05):**  Um, and then, you know, they, they have an operating team that typically folks that are  experienced in regenerative line management, um, kind of running the show.  I think that model is great for the land.  
**[1:19:17-1:19:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:19:17):**  Um, but you're totally right in thinking about like, what's this going to do to the rural  economy and, you know, how is it going to change, you know, what folks that are currently  owning the land and operating land are doing and is it attractive for them too?  
**[1:19:35-1:19:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:19:35):**  Um, I feel like that part's probably left out a lot, especially generationally.  So, you know, I know of one group that particularly focuses on that point where, you know, you  have the older generation that now is, you know, might just not want to operate the land  
**[1:19:49-1:19:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:19:49):**  and then maybe their kids just don't want to be there.  Uh, they want to go into the city or they're just not present or they just don't want to  do that.  
**[1:19:57-1:20:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:19:57):**  So then they, they specialize in those particular situations, buying up the land and changing  the practices for generative and letting the, uh, I believe that they, they allow the family  to sell, known some sort of percentage.  
**[1:20:11-1:20:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:20:11):**  I think that's cool.  Um, totally right.  You know, uh, farmland prices are going to keep going up and it's been a very stable  
**[1:20:19-1:20:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:20:19):**  asset class.  I think it's a very attractive investment for anyone that has millions of dollars of  disposable income, but how many of us do?  
**[1:20:27-1:20:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:20:27):**  Not me.  Not me.  Wish I did though.  
**[1:20:31-1:20:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:20:31):**  There's a couple of nice ranches around.  I wouldn't mind owning.  Yeah.  
**[1:20:36-1:20:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:20:36):**  Same thing, Kevin.  Yeah.  I mean, it, it, and from an annualized perspective, it's super valuable.  
**[1:20:46-1:21:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:20:46):**  Um, you know, and then things like timberland are as well, but you know, the productivity  you can get from farmland, the self-sufficiency, um, just to, you know, the, the sheer, I guess  I don't want to talk about like the, the ideal nature of it, but you know, you can, you can  
**[1:21:03-1:21:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:21:03):**  build a whole economy out of it.  If you combine, you know, a diversity of outputs, um, with near, near non inputs, you know,  if you think about it, if it's a hunting ranch on top of sort of having grazing on top of  
**[1:21:17-1:21:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:21:17):**  adding some ecotourism, um, then, you know, you can do with these agriboltaic systems  that are wicked cool, but still kind of niche.  You can, you can run some of that and then you can have solar as well.  
**[1:21:28-1:21:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:21:28):**  And those are really rising right now as well.  So it's like, you know, does that change how people perceive farmland?  Yeah.  
**[1:21:38-1:21:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:21:38):**  But also, you know, it's been doing this for a number of years.  It's not like this is anything new.  Uh, it's been performing really well since like the 1990s.  
**[1:21:47-1:22:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:21:47):**  And I think people are changing how they see farming and food production.  You know, everybody we've talked to and everything we've seen in the last 18 months since COVID  started, you know, where people being successful, where are people healthy, where they're outside,  
**[1:22:05-1:22:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:22:05):**  where they're working out, where they're eating local, clean food, healthy food, regenerative  systems work.  You know, we're seeing that over and over and scalability is always a question.  
**[1:22:16-1:22:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:22:16):**  How can we scale it fast enough?  How can we get access to markets?  How can we get more people on the land that are passionate about regenerative agriculture?  
**[1:22:23-1:22:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:22:23):**  I think some of these carbon programs may have some answers, but you know, like we've  discussed, it's still, it's still a very new thing and jumping in right now is not  for everybody.  
**[1:22:35-1:22:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:22:35):**  And maybe it is, it is advisable for some people to wait.  If that's you, that's you.  Other people, it might be better for you to get in now.  
**[1:22:44-1:22:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:22:44):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I mean, again, you know, changing these practices gives you more than just carbon.  
**[1:22:52-1:23:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:22:52):**  So it's not like you're only going to be relying sort of on the carbon credit payment to have  a better system and spend more profit.  What it does is one, if you're transitioning, it cushions the blow a little bit, provides  
**[1:23:06-1:23:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:23:06):**  more collateral and alternative revenue stream, but you know, it reduces the input costs that  you have.  You know, it increases the value of the land.  
**[1:23:16-1:23:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:23:16):**  So you know, I always say that carbon is, it's not the cherry on top, but it's just,  it's another piece of the pie.  And it's really important to think about the whole pie when you're thinking about what  
**[1:23:28-1:23:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:23:28):**  changing to a regenerative system adds.  And carbon's obviously a big unknown there.  And also, you know, like you said, Brian, it has the chance to go up to, you know, 60,  
**[1:23:40-1:23:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:23:40):**  70, $100 a ton.  I mean, I can't say with confidence when that will happen and if that will happen, but it  will go up.  
**[1:23:47-1:24:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:23:47):**  Right now, we're sort of at these floor prices because we still have a voluntary market.  And a floor price is always a good place to start.  You know, I'm not going to complain about where the floor price is for what I feel like,  
**[1:24:01-1:24:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:24:01):**  you know, is possible with my soil types.  So we kind of got to get out of here in a little bit.  Is there anything we've left on the table you want to get off your chest?  
**[1:24:13-1:24:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:24:13):**  Yeah, you know, thank you for having me.  You know, I think soil carbon is awesome.  It's really cool to read about scientifically if you guys want to geek out on it as much  
**[1:24:28-1:24:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:24:28):**  as I do.  You know, I one thing I'll say is I try and be overly cautious with things.  You know, there are technologies that are merging that will make measurement a lot easier,  
**[1:24:39-1:24:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:24:39):**  faster and more reliable.  Like, you know, something something that's called an eddy covariance power is really  cool.  
**[1:24:46-1:24:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:24:46):**  It literally can measure how much carbon is going in and out of the land for a certain  area.  So I just think that it's really important to be optimistic about these things.  
**[1:24:56-1:25:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:24:56):**  Like I said, you know, my own personal journey in a year, a lot has changed for me.  And I feel like a lot more in tune with my food.  I personally feel better and I feel like it's a good thing for the rest of the world.  
**[1:25:10-1:25:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:25:10):**  But you know, at the heart of all this is trust.  And you got to trust the people that you're working with and make sure that they're trustworthy.  Perfect.  
**[1:25:22-1:25:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:25:22):**  Perfect.  Well, CK, you got anything else?  No, that was perfect.  
**[1:25:27-1:25:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:25:27):**  Thank you so much for your time, Kevin.  I think this is a lot of people have been requesting this and I didn't want to give  this because I feel like it's easier to be heard from you because you've been doing the  
**[1:25:37-1:25:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:25:37):**  actual research behind all the soil carbon stuff instead of the person who's doing the  landowner stuff.  So I appreciate that.  
**[1:25:44-1:25:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:25:44):**  Yeah, I know.  And thanks for having me.  I mean, if you if anyone has any questions, please feel free to reach out.

Happy to answer any questions, chat with any folks that are curious about the markets.  Also, I have a newsletter focused on soil carbon.  
**[1:26:04-1:26:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:26:04):**  Try and post on it every two weeks.  You know, it's just different topics.  If there's anything you guys want to know, let me know.  
**[1:26:11-1:26:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:26:11):**  Where can we find your blog?  It's soilcarbon.substack.com.  That's the platform for independent writers these days.  
**[1:26:26-1:26:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:26:26):**  So check it out.  Anything else you want me to include in the show notes?  Any other good resources or places our listeners can go to get more information?  
**[1:26:33-1:26:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:26:33):**  I'll send a couple links after.  But I also write a newsletter every week on different regenerative topics.  For example, last week I wrote about overproduction in agriculture and the grass fed certification  
**[1:26:50-1:26:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:26:50):**  and the problems with that.  So I'll also shoot that over.  That's regeneration.substack.com.  
**[1:26:58-1:27:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:26:58):**  I'll make sure all those get in the show notes page.  Yeah, I appreciate that.  Well, thanks again for joining us, Kevin.  
**[1:27:06-1:27:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/30-Kevin-Silverman-takes-a-Deep-Dive-into-Carbon-Credits-e1794g4#t=1:27:06):**  Have a great day.  You too, man.

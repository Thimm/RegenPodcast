**[0:02:02-0:02:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:02:02):**  somebody on that isn't a stranger to the show.  Back for his fourth trip in the hot seat, Mike Calacrate.  Where are you at today, Mike?  
**[0:02:09-0:02:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:02:09):**  Colorado Springs at our meat plant.  I'd never know where you're going to be when we talk.  It's usually either St. Francis, Kansas at the ranch or I'm here in Colorado Springs.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:02:21):**  Good deal.  How's things been going?  We need a rain.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:02:25):**  We had a little rain out at St. Francis and we had a huge snow in Colorado Springs.  It was beautiful over this last weekend.  But in St. Francis, in western Kansas, Southwest Nebraska, we are in a terrible dry area and  
**[0:02:43-0:02:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:02:43):**  really hurting.  One of our bigger cow herds in the area called the other day and had to make some decisions.  They had 500 cows and no grass.  
**[0:02:56-0:03:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:02:56):**  It just wasn't green enough.  It was not going to be able to handle any cows.  And then of course you throw in there those high feed costs.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:03:06):**  I'm happy the farmer's getting a better price for grain.  But boy, we're in a real squeeze if we can't raise the feed in our area and be able to  afford to feed these cattle.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:03:25):**  I think we're going to have to unpack that can a little bit later.  But the high feed costs, lack of rain, I feel it too.  Until this morning, we were over 230 days since we've had an inch of rain and we've  
**[0:03:40-0:03:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:03:40):**  had probably an inch and three quarters since last night.  It's all come real nice and slow.  It's just this nice, slow, beautiful rain.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:03:50):**  Seems like a lot and it is.  But it's not anywhere close to what we need to make it right.  No, not yet.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:03:59):**  When you get that dry, a lot of that rain never goes into the soil.  It just gets sucked up by all the biomass and dry air.  And it's just, yeah, we need a lot more rain.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:04:13):**  Yeah, for sure.  So what have you been up to lately?  But Brian, while we're on that subject of weather, it is nice to know that that's the  
**[0:04:21-0:04:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:04:21):**  only risk that we have to face as cattle producers.  Yeah, to some extent that's one of the biggest ones.  That's the only risk, right?  
**[0:04:32-0:04:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:04:32):**  So the guys that are out there doing all the work and taking the most risk now get a drought.  So it's not easy.  It's not easy to keep things running.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:04:44):**  Yeah, for sure.  So what else have you been up to last six or so months since the last time we talked?  I've been working on a, Ranch Foods Direct is about sort of an alternative pathway to  
**[0:04:56-0:05:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:04:56):**  the marketplace for rent for me, for Calacrate Cattle Company.  In 98 when I got blackballed by the Packers, I'd already been real heavily involved in  litigation and in legislation and trying to just make cattle markets more fair and raise  
**[0:05:17-0:05:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:05:17):**  income at the farm and ranch gate every way we could.  But the third sort of solution for me was to build that pathway to the consumer around  the broken system that we talked about, that concentrated and consolidated marketplace,  
**[0:05:38-0:05:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:05:38):**  the big Packers standing in the way of us getting to the consumer and then their partners,  the big retailers and the big food service companies.  Going through them just wasn't going to leave me as a producer enough dollars to stay alive.  
**[0:05:55-0:06:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:05:55):**  So I built a Ranch Foods Direct model, but what we're doing is really taking that to  the next level here in Colorado Springs.  We just signed a contract on a land purchase to put together really it's kind of a local  
**[0:06:09-0:06:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:06:09):**  regional food village and it'll have the butcher shop, which will be us carcasses hanging fully  on display in front of customers, a fresh meat counter.  It'll take you back to 1969.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:06:26):**  I graduated from high school.  I worked in a meat shop in Evergreen, Colorado, and all of our meat came in carcasses from  the Denver meat Packers.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:06:37):**  We had pepper lit back.  We had Pueblo, Alpha Beta, Sterling Pack in Sterling, Colorado, but all the trade was  in carcasses, not boxed beef.  
**[0:06:47-0:07:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:06:47):**  So what we want to do is build a model that shows that time when it worked, when it worked  for producers, when it worked for the meat market guys, and when it worked just as well  for the consumer.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:07:04):**  So what we want to do is not only just have that meat market, because we have that now.  We have two locations in Colorado Springs where we have that now.  We cut from the carcass, but I want to put it in a format of a sort of a village to where  
**[0:07:17-0:07:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:07:17):**  the baker, the brewer, you know, maybe the distiller, the coffee roaster, the cheese  maker that of course the butcher, maybe the best steak that you can get in the region.  You know, the taco trailer, all of us that care about a local economy being healthy and  
**[0:07:42-0:08:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:07:42):**  all of us who care about eating good food and supporting people who grow food and the  independent businesses that deliver that to us have a safe place to do business.  And so I'm suggesting that we go out and we buy land and that we build each one of those  
**[0:08:03-0:08:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:08:03):**  vendors that I mentioned earlier, their own space that they can own.  Right now, if you are a young guy and you want to bake bread and open up a bakery, typically  you go to some developer or you go to some commercial real estate person and you say,  
**[0:08:24-0:08:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:08:24):**  where can I rent a place to open a bakery?  And so you'll go in and of course you don't have any money.  You're running on a shoestring.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:08:32):**  You're just hoping, hoping you can make it and people will support you.  But what happens is you jump in there into a five or a 10 year lease with a landlord  and you know, you're subject to rent increases and you're subject to cam increases and common  
**[0:08:52-0:09:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:08:52):**  area maintenance increases.  You're subject to a lot of things that you have no more control over.  And what if, what if there was a model that you could build your business inside a space  
**[0:09:07-0:09:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:09:07):**  that you could actually own and earn equity in and pay a mortgage instead of rent?  If USDA, if President Biden with his bill back better is really interested in giving  independent business and farmers and ranchers access to consumers through a local regional  
**[0:09:28-0:09:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:09:28):**  food system, I'm saying let's begin with the end in mind.  Let's build it.  Let's build that little, that community of businesses that are food related and let them  
**[0:09:39-0:09:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:09:39):**  own their space.  And then when they're ready to retire, I mean, talk about planning and investing for the  long term when you as a, as a bakery owner and you're now 75 years old and getting tired,  
**[0:09:54-0:10:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:09:54):**  maybe you're 65 years old and getting tired.  But you want to turn it over to the next generation.  Maybe it's your best employees, maybe it's your children, but you can do that now because  
**[0:10:06-0:10:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:10:06):**  you owned it.  You, you paid a mortgage instead of rent, and now you have equity in the real estate  that your business is located in.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:10:14):**  And so, and so now you can, you can say, hey, look, you guys want to buy the business.  I'm happy to sell it to you.  You can make monthly payments and you, you now assume a mortgage and that person then  
**[0:10:28-0:10:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:10:28):**  can go ahead and retire, but also advise that, you know, the new owners of that business,  you know, maybe hang out and work every now and then a year in your retirement.  I mean, it just becomes this community that sticks together and helps each other.  
**[0:10:44-0:11:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:10:44):**  So it creates opportunity immediately for farmers and ranchers to get access to the  consumer via this, this community of food producers.  But it, but it also, it also helps that next generation, you know, be able to really stay  
**[0:11:02-0:11:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:11:02):**  on the, on the ranch and stay in the bakery and stay in the meat shop and, or stay in  whatever business that that may be.  And so, you know, we're really looking at this being the alternative model to the chain,  
**[0:11:16-0:11:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:11:16):**  to the, to the franchise, to those wall street based businesses that sell things from somewhere  else in all, in all the communities around the world, and then take the money away every  day.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:11:28):**  And so I think we, we overlook the people between the ranch and the farm and the consumer,  those people who are working hard.  I mean, they haven't had a raise since 1970 in real dollars.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:11:43):**  And, you know, the model that we've got right now that COVID exposed is as fragile and totally  breakable with big meat plants and fast moving chains and inexperienced workers standing  shoulder to shoulder, that just doesn't work.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:11:59):**  And it won't work going forward.  And why we want to build more of those kinds of facilities beyond me, let's invest our  money in that local regional food system, as I've described, and, and, and really build  
**[0:12:11-0:12:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:12:11):**  something that's resilient and sustainable.  Okay.  Yeah, there's, there was a lot there.  
**[0:12:21-0:12:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:12:21):**  You know, I've heard that I've heard rumors at the Packers that the big four are trying  to build some new plants, but again, we still haven't seen any news release.  Nobody's talking about it.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:12:33):**  And nobody's, you know, been posting on social media saying, Oh, hey, there's a new Cargill  plant going in down the street from me.  I don't, it doesn't seem like they're trying to add capacity to leave, you know, to work  
**[0:12:47-0:13:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:12:47):**  with any shortages.  And I start to get really concerned about, you know, we, we talk about small scale meat  plants and, you know, mid, mid scale and community size meat plants, but on it, I'm starting  
**[0:13:02-0:13:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:13:02):**  to wonder how many of those do we have to have to make a difference or will they all  make a difference?  No, they won't make a difference at all.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:13:13):**  Brian, the first thing we have to do is break up the abusive market power, the concentrated  power of the, of the current meat packing and in retail food service businesses that  are out there that now control the market building new infrastructure that sells to  
**[0:13:31-0:13:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:13:31):**  the existing infrastructure at any level, whether it's food service or retail absolutely  will not work.  These folks are used to making 30% return on their equity.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:13:47):**  Cisco last at the end of the year was for the five, six year average was over 43% return  on equity.  They are not going to willingly give that up.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:13:58):**  And of course, their whole business has been, you know, making money for their shareholders  and executives and all of that.  And they feel that's their responsibility.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:14:07):**  And honestly, it is and that's part of the problem.  It is their responsibility to lie, cheat and steal to make all the damn money they can  possibly make.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:14:16):**  And you don't just tell them to be nice and hopefully get let you have a seat at the table.  You got to kick their ass, you've got to break them up.  You have there should not be a conglomerate anywhere on the planet that controls any part  
**[0:14:34-0:14:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:14:34):**  of any vital, vital industry in the United States.  Their conglomerates should should we shouldn't allow conglomerates to even exist.  Look what General or General Electric did.

They got big enough that they knew themselves that they had become inefficient and that  they were not doing a great job and all these various industries that they had decided to  
**[0:15:01-0:15:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:15:01):**  put money in and run.  So they broke themselves up.  Johnson and Johnson is breaking themselves up.  
**[0:15:08-0:15:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:15:08):**  I mean, has didn't antitrust wait a little long, a little too long when the companies  themselves say, hey, you guys should have, you know, should have thrown the flag on us,  you know, 30 years ago.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:15:20):**  Where have you been?  You could have saved us some money.  You know, we just thought we actually believed our own lie that bigger is better and we were  
**[0:15:27-0:15:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:15:27):**  wrong.  There's another there's another monopolized commodity that's in that's having shortages.  And by this time, by the time this one comes out in about a week, I bet we'll still be  
**[0:15:42-0:15:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:15:42):**  hearing about it.  Baby food shortages.  Three companies make like 98 percent of the baby food sold in the United States.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:15:50):**  Three companies, 98 percent.  Nobody sees a problem with that.  And Abbott, the conglomerate Abbott controls five percent.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:15:59):**  It's five percent of their of their business.  And they control like 90 something percent of the market.  And the government is complicit in this whole thing.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:16:07):**  The government is part of the problem because they fueled it.  They've supported concentration and consolidation and got us where we are today in this completely  broken system.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:16:17):**  But my goodness, Abbott, you know, they got they got to deal with the government.  The government gave them a monopoly through through the WIC program, Women and Infants  Nutrition Program.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:16:30):**  And and so here they get five five percent of their company, but it's 90 percent of the  entire supply of formula in the country.  And is that something that the CEO really gives?  
**[0:16:45-0:16:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:16:45):**  Does he really care about it?  It's five percent of the company.  You know, oh, it might be a little bit of an irritant right now when mothers are screaming  
**[0:16:52-0:16:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:16:52):**  at him.  But honestly, the mothers can't even find him.  Does the factory manager care?  
**[0:16:58-0:17:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:16:58):**  No.  And so I'm just saying we made some really big mistakes.  And like I said, a conglomerate, that's the best example.  
**[0:17:06-0:17:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:17:06):**  A conglomerate should never control the supply of baby formula.  And of course, you know, this is really serious when you when you can't feed your babies,  when you can't feed the infants and take care of them.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:17:19):**  It's also a real problem that mothers don't have time to nurse.  They got to get back to work.  You know, they can't pay the mortgage if they don't.  
**[0:17:28-0:17:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:17:28):**  I mean, why are we putting so much pressure on all these young mothers when if the economy  worked and there was a fair distribution of income throughout the you know, we'd be moms  could stay with at home with their kids, you know, because the the the other breadwinner  
**[0:17:46-0:17:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:17:46):**  or the main breadwinner of the family could could earn enough at his job to pay the mortgage.  But no, he worked he works at Tyson in Garden City, and they live seven families to a trailer  house.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:17:59):**  And now we and we hell we can't even get milk.  And she works at Dollar General.  Exactly.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:18:04):**  They don't have enough money to even live.  And so and so had the meat shelves been empty longer, it would have probably helped people  become more aware of the threat and the insecurity of having big corporations in charge of your  
**[0:18:20-0:18:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:18:20):**  food supply.  You know, when the Tyson fire happened in Garden City, they you know, there was some  there was some big price movements and they call it the Black Swan.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:18:32):**  And then we have another Black Swan with COVID and another Black Swan with with somebody  tapping into JBS's computer system, all these Black Swans and pretty quick, it just it just  becomes the standard ordinary deal.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:18:46):**  It's always a wreck.  There's they're always trying to figure out how to pay less for cattle and charge consumers  more for meat.  
**[0:18:54-0:19:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:18:54):**  And I'm just saying we don't get rid of these kangul this conglomerate ownership of these  critical industries, we can't get anywhere.  And so the Justice Department has got to get with USDA and and has got to get with the  
**[0:19:07-0:19:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:19:07):**  Federal Trade Commission and they got to put a plan together to break these plants up.  And I'm suggesting that there should not be any multi plant ownership at all.  These these big guys like Tyson, they each plant that they own is about five or 6% of  
**[0:19:25-0:19:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:19:25):**  the total slaughter in the US.  Each plant and I'm saying let them own one plant period.  If there is an efficiency economy of scale benefit, it'll be realized at that level.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:19:41):**  But I would argue that it's not efficient, most certainly got an economy of scale argument,  but it's just basic raw market power that keeps competitors out.  And as long as we allow these guys to slaughter this many animals in across our country and  
**[0:19:59-0:20:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:19:59):**  multi species in addition, there's no reason for these for these plants to be killing or  controlling all three meat categories in and including even the fourth the fake meat.  So you take a Cargill, they're in all the categories are from there in poultry, pork,  
**[0:20:17-0:20:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:20:17):**  beef, and fake meat.  JBS same way.  Tyson Cargill, JBS all of them are the same way.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:20:25):**  And I'm just saying if we want a resilient food system, one that works one that keeps  people on the land with a fair share of the consumer dollar, these guys got to go.  And their buddies at retail, Kroger, Walmart, Amazon, which whole owns Whole Foods, those  
**[0:20:42-0:20:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:20:42):**  guys got to go to you, you've got to create the pathway to the consumer.  And that's why I go back to the little the village sort of concept that I just mentioned,  I think consumers are clamoring for it.  
**[0:20:54-0:21:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:20:54):**  There's a little town north of Colorado Springs, by the name of monument that that Starbucks  coffee shop came into town and put a put a shop in well, there's, there's a longtime  coffee shop named Serrano's that's been there for a long time.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:21:09):**  And it was really cool the way the community when Starbucks came in, they just didn't go  there.  Now, that's hard.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:21:14):**  I mean, it's like, that's really amazing that this community said no to Starbucks and continued  to support their local coffee shop.  And so you go up there, and Serrano's will be just packed full.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:21:27):**  And there'll be two people in Starbucks.  And of course, you know, Starbucks has probably got a location across the interstate, and  it's not far to get to another Starbucks.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:21:36):**  But but I'm just saying we've had enough of these darn big corporate control chains and  and franchises that extract well, not only from our communities and main streets, but  from our farms and ranches and, and the workers who make sure that food gets to our plates.  
**[0:21:56-0:22:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:21:56):**  So I know we've talked we talked about this often about using the Packers and Stockyards  Act to break up the Packers.  And it's like, that's an antitrust.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:22:11):**  I guess that that's a weapon of antitrust in the government's toolbag, right?  Yeah, it's specifically designed to protect the producer.  And, and it was really just never enforced.  
**[0:22:22-0:22:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:22:22):**  After, you know, much after the breakup of the Packers 120 or so years ago, we it was  actually 100 years ago that we broke up the Packers 1921 Packers Stockyards Act, and they  had a consent decree that basically made they could broke up the conglomerate control.  
**[0:22:40-0:22:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:22:40):**  So they had to give up retail railroad stockyards.  I mean, if you were going to be a packer, you had to be a packer, you couldn't be feeding  the cow.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:22:48):**  And so that that really worked.  But but that really never got enforced.  And, and we came into that era when, you know, Ronald Reagan was president, and even before  
**[0:22:57-0:23:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:22:57):**  that somewhat, and we just decided that corporations were nice, and we should, we should let them  get as big as they want to get, because we really believe big is better.  And it's time to globalize and have big companies that can sell and buy on a global basis.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:23:14):**  And we just wiped out the Packers Stockyards Act with with lack of enforcement.  But there was a there was a really big hit to the Packers Stockyards Act with the with  the Tyson IBP case that I was a plaintiff in.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:23:28):**  You know, I blame Judge Lolly strong.  He was one of those Reagan appointees that didn't believe in antitrust law enforcement,  didn't believe in, you know, holding corporations accountable.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:23:39):**  And he we won that lawsuit against Tyson IBP.  When the jury awarded its $1.28 billion.  And it was in 2004, that that trial occurred.  
**[0:23:52-0:24:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:23:52):**  And, and the jury apologized to us, we're sorry, you deserve a lot more, but we didn't  have a mathematical formula available to us that would that would allow it.  And in but honestly, we didn't care about the money.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:24:09):**  We wanted the injunctive relief, we wanted the Packers to compete again, instead of cooperate,  and and continue their anti competitive practices.  And so, Lyle strong, we knew he was in Tyson's pocket when he wrote the jury instructions,  
**[0:24:27-0:24:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:24:27):**  because the jury instructions were really written as if as if the Clayton or Sherman  Act was being applied to this case.  What's that?  
**[0:24:35-0:24:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:24:35):**  The Sherman and Clayton acts or antitrust laws that happened before the Packers and  stockyards that that really addressed that robber baron monopoly economy that we had  around 1900.  
**[0:24:49-0:24:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:24:49):**  You know, Epson Sinclair wrote the book, the jungle in 1906.  And, and that that really shone the light on the big meat packers and all their bad  behavior.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:24:59):**  But but we at that time, we were we were passing laws to control monopoly.  And so that's what the Sherman and the Clayton Act were about.  And, and it basically it prevented collusion, but it was all about not the consumer benefit,  
**[0:25:18-0:25:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:25:18):**  how, how do we protect the consumer?  And so here, the meat monopoly comes along.  And then it becomes a question then, when Congress was considering what to do, it was  
**[0:25:28-0:25:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:25:28):**  about how do we protect the producer.  And so it's specifically to protect the producer, which was great.  And and it helped us for some time.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:25:39):**  But with Judge Strom in the Alabama case against Tyson, IBP, he wrote jury instructions that  were very much in line with with the ones you would see for for the Sherman and Clayton  Act.  
**[0:25:53-0:26:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:25:53):**  And he was, he was, he believed that, you know, that's where this harm to competition  problem came from, you know, so if you're if you're at Terry in, in, on the East Coast,  you know, contract growing for Tyson, and you find out that Tyson is cheating you on  
**[0:26:16-0:26:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:26:16):**  the chicken whites, you've got to prove that because chice Tyson cheated you on your chicken  whites, you've got to prove that that harmed chicken growers all across the United States.  Well, no, it didn't.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:26:30):**  It harmed at Terry, at Terry proved that Tyson cheated him on his chicken whites.  But he couldn't get relief under the Packers and stockyards Act.  Because the judges had decided that he had to prove harm to competition.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:26:46):**  Well, that might be true for the Sherman and Clayton acts, but it is absolutely not true  for the Packers and Stockyards Act.  In fact, the Packers and Stockyards plain language says that no meat pack, no meat packer  
**[0:26:58-0:27:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:26:58):**  can do anything that even so much has the effect of reducing competition.  And so how do we end up with 80 and 85% captive supplies with the meat packer staying out  of the market for six weeks in the spring of 1994?  
**[0:27:15-0:27:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:27:15):**  Not buying any cattle drop in the market $17 a hundred ways.  How does that happen if you've got a Packers and Stockyards Act that says anything they  do that even has the effect of reducing competition they can't do?  
**[0:27:30-0:27:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:27:30):**  And the other thing that Judge Strom said is, or what Judge Strom believed was that  if these Packers have a business reason, rule of reason, in other words, if they have a  business reason, if they have to do something to meet the competition, like feed cattle,  
**[0:27:48-0:28:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:27:48):**  or better yet, the formula that IVP developed where they had captive supply without having  to own the cattle, if they had to do that to compete with Cargill and ConAgra, now ConAgra  is JBS, then that was okay.  
**[0:28:02-0:28:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:28:02):**  That wasn't all bad and we're not going to tie their hands while their competitors run  over them.  And so rather than do the right thing and just say, look, no packer can have captive  
**[0:28:13-0:28:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:28:13):**  supplies, no packer can have ownership of the livestock to the extent that it impacts  competition in the market.  And no, we didn't do that.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:28:26):**  We just, we gave them a green light.  And so in that lawsuit against Tyson and IVP that was decided in 2004, the judge gave the  green light to the big Packers to pillage and plunder all they want.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:28:41):**  I mean, without any worry about law enforcement.  And you remember back when Tyson was buying IVP, right after John Tyson, it was in 2002,  he was at the National Cattlemen's Beef Association meeting there to give a talk and basically  
**[0:28:58-0:29:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:28:58):**  announced that he was buying IVP and that the cattlemen shouldn't worry because it was  going to be just fine.  We weren't going to do the cattle producers what we did to chicken growers.

And I said, you know, John, I've got a lawsuit against you.  If you buy IVP, you're going to be buying a lawsuit.  
**[0:29:24-0:29:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:29:24):**  And he said, well, what lawsuit is that?  I said, well, it's a package.  It's anti-competitive practices.  
**[0:29:30-0:29:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:29:30):**  IVP has been using captive supplies to depress the cash market.  It's anti-competitive and it's illegal under the law.  And Tyson says, well, I know all about the Patrons and Stockyards Act.  
**[0:29:40-0:29:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:29:40):**  And I said, yeah, I'm sure you do.  I said, had it been properly applied, you wouldn't be where you are in the chicken business.  You certainly wouldn't be where you are today buying the biggest meat packer, IVP.  
**[0:29:51-0:30:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:29:51):**  And so we fussed back and forth a little bit.  And then he said, well, you know, Mike, you're suing the wrong people.  You should be suing Walmart.  
**[0:30:01-0:30:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:30:01):**  They dictate price to us and we have no choice but to pay you less.  And I said, exactly.  I totally agree.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:30:10):**  And had you not had such a large amount of market power, you couldn't pay us less.  Had IVP not had their captive supplies, had Tyson in the poultry business not been able  to lower their cost of production by not paying growers a fair price and workers a fair wage,  
**[0:30:31-0:30:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:30:31):**  they wouldn't be able to produce less and less for the Walmart contract every year.  And so John Tyson was right.  But the problem is judges like Lyle Strom and other D-reg judges, mostly of the Reagan  
**[0:30:47-0:31:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:30:47):**  era that were appointed on the federal bench, those guys really gave corporations new power  to do even worse things than we've seen even from the 1900 time frame.  Today our markets are more concentrated by almost double what they were then.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:31:05):**  Food safety is worse now than it was then, except on a much larger scale with more efficient  distribution to the consumer.  And you think about the recalls that we have and the size of those recalls and how widespread  
**[0:31:19-0:31:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:31:19):**  they are.  So that same efficient distribution system works great for pathogens as well.  We're treating workers as bad as we did back in the jungle era, except we're treating a  
**[0:31:31-0:31:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:31:31):**  lot more of them worse and we're treating them worse also in other countries, even Canada,  Mexico.  In order to compete with JDS and these big meat packers that run chains so fast, everybody  
**[0:31:43-0:31:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:31:43):**  else has to do the same thing.  And so I'm just saying, I think it's time to put a stop to it.  And let's honestly, truly rebuild local regional food systems that actually work like 1969  
**[0:31:57-0:32:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:31:57):**  when I was in that meat market in Evergreen, Colorado.  It was inside the thrifty grocery store.  What's your timeline for your food village?  
**[0:32:05-0:32:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:32:05):**  When do you hope to have that run in?  Well we signed a contract to purchase the real estate.  Now we're doing our due diligence, but it looks like we should have all of that pretty  
**[0:32:17-0:32:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:32:17):**  well figured out by November 1st.  And then it's a matter of getting construction documents approved and all of that.  So I think we're looking at 2024 to get that done.  
**[0:32:33-0:32:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:32:33):**  But Brian, this is where the farmer's market is going to be held.  This is where the music is going to be played.  This is where we can de-stress instead of stress.  
**[0:32:46-0:32:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:32:46):**  This is where you're going to go and talk to everybody.  This is where you're going to go and the kids are going to be able to have a safe place  to play while you have a beer and a burger.  
**[0:32:58-0:33:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:32:58):**  And when it's time to go home, those kids are going to be saying, are you ready to go?  And they're going to go to sleep when they get home.  This is going to be the place where really community happens and independent business  
**[0:33:12-0:33:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:33:12):**  thrives and farmers and ranchers get a fair share of the consumer dollar.  And you know what?  Consumers aren't going to pay a penny more than what they're paying now because there  
**[0:33:20-0:33:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:33:20):**  is plenty of money.  There's never been more money in the food system, in the food business at the consumer  level and never, never so little going back to the people who actually grow stuff and  
**[0:33:31-0:33:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:33:31):**  do the work.  Yep.  And the more inflation hits, like the more inflation sets in and like puts it sticky  
**[0:33:40-0:33:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:33:40):**  little fingers on the economy, the more that's going to affect food price.  I guess that the more it will affect the price of food that has to trend that has to go through  a bunch of different hands and a bunch of different middlemen before it gets to you.  
**[0:33:55-0:34:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:33:55):**  You know, we slaughter our cattle right on the ranch where they're raised.  So we got pigs and cattle out there that we, that we killed right on site.  And just think about that efficiency of not having to haul the animal.  
**[0:34:09-0:34:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:34:09):**  You know, I ran into a trucker in St. Francis last week that was loading cattle in right  in our area to go to Skyler, Nebraska with $5 diesel fuel.  Are you kidding me?  
**[0:34:23-0:34:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:34:23):**  Why would you take them four or 500 miles to slaughter when, you know, the Garden City  plant's 170 miles away.  You know, we've got the, we've got the brush plant or that, or Fort Morgan plant that's  
**[0:34:38-0:34:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:34:38):**  120 miles away.  You know, Greeley, that's 180.  I mean, what is going on here?  
**[0:34:43-0:34:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:34:43):**  And so you think about that inefficiency, but I honestly weren't those, those cattle  were very likely being hauled from Northwest Kansas to Skyler, Nebraska, because they needed  the cattle back there to break the market or so that they didn't have to go into the  
**[0:34:56-0:35:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:34:56):**  market and push the cash price up.  And so they're, they're, they're regionally, they're working with cattle supplies that  they have control of to keep the prices down at all their plants.  
**[0:35:07-0:35:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:35:07):**  And this is just an example of one of the anti-competitive practices.  Do you think that they would buy, do you think that they would have some other contractor  on a formula in one yard, maybe have a little oversupply and then ship those at a loss to  
**[0:35:20-0:35:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:35:20):**  another region, just to mean, just to depress a price?  Of course they do.  In fact, we knew that from, from when ConAgra was selling cattle at IBP years ago.  
**[0:35:29-0:35:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:35:29):**  You know, ConAgra had a few extra cattle, which they had those 300,000 head and those  three feedlots up in near Greeley in Yuma, Colorado.  And you know, you get a little long on some cattle, you can, you can sell them to IBP  
**[0:35:41-0:35:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:35:41):**  and it helps break the market.  Actually that was, excuse me, that wasn't, that wasn't ConAgra, that was Cargill that,  that sold, I'll have to look that up.  
**[0:35:51-0:36:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:35:51):**  It was, it was either Cargill or ConAgra that anyway, Cargill had the same situation.  They had a bunch of feedlots too, but, but they actually literally sold cattle at IBP.  I mean, a big number of cattle, and we saw the market drop, literally drop, you know,  
**[0:36:07-0:36:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:36:07):**  a lot of dollars within, within that week that those packers were able to stay out of  the market.  So again, you know, you can't, you can't match an independent cattle feeder against a multinational  
**[0:36:19-0:36:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:36:19):**  conglomerate and hope to have any market power.  It's just not going to happen.  And so you go, you got to go back to your, your first question, you know, you know, how  
**[0:36:31-0:36:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:36:31):**  do we, you know, what do we do?  I mean, do we need more big plants?  No, we don't.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:36:36):**  We need to, we need to scatter those investments out and, and we need to feed the people in  a, in a region, not, not the people around the world.  And we need to let the world do the same thing.  
**[0:36:47-0:36:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:36:47):**  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, and I can start to see the problems with big corporate structure, say a big company  
**[0:36:58-0:37:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:36:58):**  that's run for the benefit of the shareholders.  Okay.  The people that manage that company, they have a responsibility to turn a profit for  
**[0:37:05-0:37:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:37:05):**  the shareholders to show return for the shareholders.  And that goes for everybody from everybody in management, all the salaried management  type people.  
**[0:37:15-0:37:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:37:15):**  So you take, you know, a large company, we'll name any one of them because we don't want  to get sued, but you know, we could, you could pick a name because there's so many of them  having supply chain problems.  
**[0:37:26-0:37:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:37:26):**  So you have a plant that has to shut down for some reason.  Well, the manager of that plant, is he under any special pressure to get it running?  Probably not.  
**[0:37:39-0:37:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:37:39):**  Well, do the best you can.  He's going to do the best he can.  But say, if it was a manufacturer of baby food formula, and it was a family that owned  
**[0:37:51-0:38:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:37:51):**  that, that worked there every day, they would wake up every day and go to work owning that  plant and know that their mission in life was to provide safe, clean, nutritious baby  formula to whatever babies needed.  
**[0:38:05-0:38:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:38:05):**  Right.  Right.  But when you remove that ownership layer, and you distance them so far from the means  
**[0:38:15-0:38:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:38:15):**  of production, or the place or the mechanism of production, you lose a lot of accountability.  Yeah, that's right.  And you know, you go back to COVID.  
**[0:38:31-0:38:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:38:31):**  What did Ranch Foods Direct do when COVID hit?  We never had an empty shelf.  We just worked harder.  
**[0:38:37-0:38:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:38:37):**  I mean, it's such a small company.  It's such it's the, you know, just serves the communities that it's in St. Francis,  Kansas, and in Colorado Springs, but we we work really hard.  
**[0:38:50-0:39:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:38:50):**  I mean, our guys just stepped up.  And I mean, you know, we just did all we just worked as fast and hard as we could.  And we kept shelves full while the other guys's shelves were bare, completely bare and empty.  
**[0:39:04-0:39:18](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:39:04):**  And so we've already proved that and it's kind of like the keg restaurant in Manitou.  It's a family owned restaurant.  We've supplied them ever since we've been in Colorado Springs, and for 20 some years  
**[0:39:18-0:39:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:39:18):**  and, and they came out of COVID probably with the best year they had had financially.  At the same time, as a lot of other restaurants went bankrupt, and just closed down.  And chains closed up and, you know, their workers didn't want to come to work.  
**[0:39:38-0:39:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:39:38):**  They didn't own the place.  But the keg right away decided to go curbside.  And they sold a lot of food curbside with a lot less labor expense in their business.  
**[0:39:51-0:40:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:39:51):**  And so they've come out of it in good shape.  And, and they're ready to go on.  Now what about those restaurants in Great Bend, Kansas, or Salina, Kansas, that Cisco  
**[0:40:04-0:40:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:40:04):**  failed to deliver?  Now what are you going to do?  They don't have a Ranch Foods Direct supply in them like the keg.  
**[0:40:10-0:40:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:40:10):**  The keg never ran out of meat.  We never ran out of meat.  But those little restaurants in Salina and Great Bend and in Larned and wherever they  
**[0:40:19-0:40:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:40:19):**  may be, and they've been buying off the Cisco truck, they just didn't get deliveries.  So they didn't even if they wanted to, they couldn't, they couldn't have continued with  curbside or contact free delivery.  
**[0:40:30-0:40:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:40:30):**  They couldn't have done it.  And what was really weird is when Cisco decided they weren't going to deliver the small restaurants  and in fact, we're going to rather take care of their national accounts, which are chains  
**[0:40:43-0:41:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:40:43):**  and franchises, then US Food decided they weren't going to call on Cisco's accounts,  that they weren't going to sell Cisco's accounts.  Well the bottom line is they, you know, they had, you know, looked at merging with Cisco.  
**[0:41:01-0:41:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:41:01):**  It was going to buy US Foods or merge with US Foods earlier, and they got to know each  other really well.  Well they didn't now they didn't have to buy, they didn't have to merge.  
**[0:41:11-0:41:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:41:11):**  They had all the benefits of just knowing each other really well and having the same  objective of maximizing profits.  And so they decided, well, like the big backers, why don't we just cooperate rather than compete?  
**[0:41:24-0:41:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:41:24):**  And so if Cisco wasn't going to deliver the account, then the US Food Service wasn't going  to deliver the account.  And so now you got small plants, small restaurants, food service or food related businesses that  
**[0:41:35-0:41:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:41:35):**  can't get supply.  And so you just think how vulnerable they are.  And so now they not only have the problem with supply, which the keg didn't have, and  
**[0:41:44-0:42:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:41:44):**  our customers at Ranch Foods didn't have, but now they got the landlord trying to raise  the rent, or the landlords trying to demand, you know, that they pay, you know, whatever.  And now, like you said about the inflation thing, all of diesel fuel at five bucks is  
**[0:42:02-0:42:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:42:02):**  creeping into everything, everything's going to go up because diesel's at five bucks.  But the biggest problem with inflation is not true inflation, it's price gouging.  And you mentioned their loyalty and their legal responsibilities to maximize shareholder  
**[0:42:19-0:42:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:42:19):**  returns.  And so if you're an oil company, and you want to maximize shareholder returns, and you're  in a position of monopoly power, or at least shared monopoly power with three other oil

**[0:42:40-0:42:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:42:40):**  And people everywhere are going to be hurt.  And this just gets back to why in the world that antitrust sleep so long.  They are showing signs of waking up.  
**[0:42:53-0:43:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:42:53):**  Just signs.  There hasn't been any real progress yet.  And I mean, really, Justice Department, where's the where's the report on the Tyson fire?  
**[0:43:03-0:43:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:43:03):**  You know, where's the report on the on the price fixing during COVID?  You know, JBS paid 52 and a half million in settlements for for fixing the price at the  same time as a report a billion dollar profit.  
**[0:43:17-0:43:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:43:17):**  Really is 52 million going to make a difference?  It certainly isn't going to make any difference to the people they cheated.  I sent you that rap sheet on JBS earlier today.  
**[0:43:26-0:43:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:43:26):**  I don't know if you had time to check your email, but JBS has got quite the impressive  rap sheet.  And so honestly, you know, part of the deal with corporate charters is you have to, you  
**[0:43:38-0:43:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:43:38):**  can't be a felon, you can't be a, you know, a serial lawbreaker, you've got to you've  got to behave well.  So I'm just wondering, why are we allowing JBS to have a charter dot do business and  
**[0:43:51-0:44:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:43:51):**  the same for Tyson Smithfield Cargill and all these others?  The last time we talked, you brought up the that there is a USDA rule that prevented felons  from owning packing plants in the United States.  
**[0:44:06-0:44:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:44:06):**  And I think he said that you'd you'd called out JBS already wants to the USDA.  And the answer was, well, they're not felons in the US.  They're just felons in Brazil.  
**[0:44:21-0:44:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:44:21):**  So that's okay.  Did that change?  No, that didn't change.  
**[0:44:26-0:44:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:44:26):**  In fact, I love Greg Gunthorpe wrote him a letter to and and said, Look, you know, these  guys are multiple.  I mean, serious felons.  
**[0:44:34-0:44:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:44:34):**  I mean, they bribed the last three presidents of Brazil, almost 2000 government officials  and inspectors get rotten meat in the United States.  At what point do you pull their grant of inspection?  
**[0:44:46-0:44:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:44:46):**  I mean, if I did that, I mean, I'd never I mean, I'd never be in the back of the meat  business.  And so I you know, the government is favoring the big plants over the little plants.  
**[0:44:57-0:45:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:44:57):**  And there's so many common sense things they could do to help small plants and reduce the  onerous, you know, inspection process that they deal with and make it actually a lot  better and a lot safer and easier to to, to, you know, hold people accountable.  
**[0:45:15-0:45:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:45:15):**  But USDA is not interested in that USDA is only interested in the benefit of big corporations  and, you know, the big the big slaughterhouses and of course, you know, we've got the revolving  door from big business into into the agencies and back again and now Mazda the guy that  
**[0:45:34-0:45:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:45:34):**  let the rotten meat in from JBS when he was, you know, food safety inspection.  Yeah, he administrator for food safety inspection service.  You know, he just when Sonny Purdue made him stop it, the stop importing the rotten meat.  
**[0:45:51-0:46:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:45:51):**  He quit and went to work for JBS, who was shipping us the rotten meat.  That's the kind of thing we got to stop.  Almanza should be in prison for what he did.  
**[0:46:01-0:46:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:46:01):**  And yet he got a $5 million upfront payment and he's no doubt getting a livable wage out  of the Matista brothers.  And we got to the point where these meat packers are now in that I guess the unofficial, legal  
**[0:46:19-0:46:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:46:19):**  governmental protected status of too big to fail.  And they're just kind of looking the other way and letting them do whatever they want  to do.  
**[0:46:27-0:46:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:46:27):**  Because that really seems like that's what's happening.  Like too big to fail.  And I can also define too big to fail, as too many congressmen are invested in those  
**[0:46:36-0:46:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:46:36):**  companies to let them go to let anything happen to them.  Yeah, and invest in a different couple of different ways.  But you know, the Tyson fire, although it wasn't, you know, really legitimate, I mean,  
**[0:46:49-0:47:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:46:49):**  they actually killed more cattle the following week than they've been they've done before  the fire.  I mean, so they were able to work Saturdays and speed things up and we're able to fill  
**[0:47:01-0:47:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:47:01):**  in but they used it as a way to break the market and to maximize their profits.  And so yeah, they hold that just this whole price gouging thing.  If we don't break up this abusive power, we're never going to see an end to what we would  
**[0:47:20-0:47:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:47:20):**  call inflation, which is actually price gouging.  Yeah.  Yep.  
**[0:47:27-0:47:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:47:27):**  So over the last couple weeks, I've had I spoke with several people.  Brett Kinsey, that episode just came out just well today as we're recording it.  So and then a couple weeks ago, I had Don Shifflebean from NCBA on did you did you  
**[0:47:43-0:47:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:47:43):**  get a chance to catch that episode?  I watched every minute of it, right?  I was I was I couldn't believe Don's answer.  
**[0:47:52-0:48:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:47:52):**  Don's answer to us being successful is we have to innovate.  Really, where's the innovation?  We don't need we don't need a fair share of the consumer dollar.  
**[0:48:04-0:48:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:48:04):**  We don't need the living wage and and I get very tired of all these guys that are out  there trying to tell you how to farm and how to ranch and you know, you need smaller cows  you need you know, you need more cows you need, you know, rotational grazing if you  
**[0:48:19-0:48:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:48:19):**  go regenerative, you can save money.  It's this idea that we've got to be the low cost producer and and the last man standing  with all the technology and all of the practices and management and stuff that's going on while  
**[0:48:32-0:48:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:48:32):**  our kids leave and never want to come back.  Why the hell don't we go after what's really wrong?  And that is our share of the consumer dollar is dropped as a result of big meat packers  
**[0:48:44-0:48:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:48:44):**  cooperating rather than competing, rigging the markets and paying us too damn little.  When are we going to go after that darn problem?  And we're wasting valuable time.  
**[0:48:58-0:49:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:48:58):**  I'm with you.  I mean, you know, I'm with you.  And the thing that stuck out to me is it was kind of, I think it was about the first half  
**[0:49:07-0:49:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:49:07):**  hour.  I said something, he said something, I said something, and then he really kind of pushed  back on me about knowing your customer, that you have to know your customer.  
**[0:49:19-0:49:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:49:19):**  And my thought was, yes, you do.  And I'm pretty sure I know who my customer is.  I feel like I have a good idea of who his customer is.  
**[0:49:33-0:49:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:49:33):**  And I know you know your customer.  And let's just say that you and I are kind of standing on one side of the road and he's  standing on another with who our customer is.  
**[0:49:45-0:49:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:49:45):**  But that's important.  Because yes, you have to know who your customer is and what your customer wants.  And you have to make a product that makes sense for you that makes economic sense for  
**[0:49:56-0:50:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:49:56):**  you to make for that customer.  Yeah, well, Don Shufflebine's customers, big meat packer.  And Don Shufflebine serves the big meat packers interest as president of NCBA.  
**[0:50:09-0:50:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:50:09):**  And I honestly feel sorry for the guy.  I mean, he's obviously a nice person.  He's got a nice family.  
**[0:50:14-0:50:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:50:14):**  And he's done a good job of bringing them into the operation.  He's like a great job about his advantages.  You know, he can innovate, well, we can feed byproducts.  
**[0:50:23-0:50:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:50:23):**  Well, that's great.  You can feed byproducts while Paul Engler's feeding, you know, $8 corn.  That's great.  
**[0:50:30-0:50:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:50:30):**  But Paul Engler's got a sweetheart deal probably that's better than you, Don Shufflebine.  You no doubt have a sweetheart deal.  Why don't you share that with us?  
**[0:50:39-0:50:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:50:39):**  Why don't you tell us what you're actually getting for your cattle?  You know, how about some transparency in CBA?  How about pulling the curtain back on this confidentiality provision that was that reversed  
**[0:50:50-0:50:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:50:50):**  the intent of mandatory price reporting?  You know, Shufflebine is on the opposite side of all of the policy that I believe needs  to happen.  
**[0:50:59-0:51:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:50:59):**  And, you know, he's been he's probably been an NCB member for a long time.  And he's probably, you know, drank the globalization Kool-Aid and bigger is better Kool-Aid.  But dog on it, there's no excuse.  
**[0:51:14-0:51:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:51:14):**  There's just no excuse for what's coming out of his mouth in the way of supporting policy  that hurts cattle producers.  Why don't we have country of origin labeling?  
**[0:51:25-0:51:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:51:25):**  You know, why did we at the rulemaking table like we did with mandatory price reporting  in the confidentiality rule, which reversed the intent of that of that piece of legislation?  Same thing happened with country of origin labeling, we passed it, it was the right thing  
**[0:51:40-0:51:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:51:40):**  to do.  And then during the rulemaking, they say, well, it won't apply to, you know, ground  or value added or cooked or whatever.  
**[0:51:49-0:51:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:51:49):**  Well, you know what, when I go to a McDonald's, which I won't do, but if I go to a McDonald's,  I want to know where the meat comes from.  Yes.  
**[0:51:57-0:52:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:51:57):**  And shouldn't I be able to know as an eater, the same as I am as a shopper at a grocery  store.  And so anyway, Don Shovelbine is taking on the position of the big meat packers, big  
**[0:52:07-0:52:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:52:07):**  retail, big food in general.  And they're using him.  He's window dressing.  
**[0:52:14-0:52:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:52:14):**  And he, you know, he's got a hat and he sets it down on the table like you're supposed  to.  And, you know, I thought that was funny.  
**[0:52:21-0:52:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:52:21):**  One of the congressmen said, oh, he knows how to put his hat on the table.  Yeah, it's crown.  The hat with the crown down.  
**[0:52:28-0:52:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:52:28):**  You know, it's like bull riders, you know, you never threw your hat on the bed.  I mean, there's some things you know that when you wear your cowboy hat.  And so, you know, he looks good.  
**[0:52:37-0:52:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:52:37):**  I mean, the guy fills the role well for NCBA, but it's a complete and total betrayal of  the cattle producer.  The people paying the check off.  
**[0:52:47-0:52:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:52:47):**  It's a complete betrayal.  And they sat there in NCBA and they watched that producer share the consumer dollar go  to nothing.  
**[0:52:54-0:53:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:52:54):**  27% during COVID when it used to be 70% when I first started feeding cattle in 1970, in  the 70s.  I mean, this guy is totally betraying the industry that he makes his money off of.  
**[0:53:10-0:53:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:53:10):**  And he's got a purebred business.  So he's got, you know, he's got some Angus cattle.  So isn't he just a little bit outside of the real market there as well?  
**[0:53:17-0:53:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:53:17):**  He's selling bulls.  But hey, I think the guy out of, you know, you ought to be selling feeder cattle to JBS  and see how that works or selling feeder cattle to Paul Engler and see how well that works.  
**[0:53:28-0:53:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:53:28):**  No, he doesn't know that.  He doesn't know all those things that are really impacting some of these members, although  we should be hearing it from bull customers.  
**[0:53:38-0:53:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:53:38):**  So something I've been thinking about since I talked to Don and you know, I talked to  Brett Kinsey from RCAP as well.  I haven't reached out to anybody at US Cattlemen's Association.  
**[0:53:51-0:54:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:53:51):**  NCBA should just for due diligence.  But here's the question.  So of those three organizations, NCBA, RCAP and USCA, those are pretty much the three  
**[0:54:01-0:54:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:54:01):**  cattle national cattlemen's organizations that everybody's heard of, right?  That's right.  So here's what I want to know.  
**[0:54:12-0:54:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:54:12):**  Where are their members geographically?  And what's the average size of those operations?  Like maybe have it on a map to where there's like a blue dot for an RCAP and the size of  
**[0:54:24-0:54:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:54:24):**  the dot is the size of the operation.  Like I'd like to see that on a map size of operation and where they're at and who they're  a member of.  
**[0:54:34-0:54:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:54:34):**  And I kind of feel like that there's going to be a pattern, right?  Like RCAP is going to be more up in the Dakotas and Montana and Idaho.  USCA is kind of going to be in the Southwest RCAP is going to be represented by the feed  
**[0:54:51-0:55:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:54:51):**  yards and the packers and the backyard cow people that are east of the Mississippi River.  RCAP?  No, RCAP would be kind of like Northern Plains.  
**[0:55:04-0:55:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:55:04):**  Yeah, that's right.  Okay.  So who are you just talking about?  
**[0:55:07-0:55:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:55:07):**  RCAP, Northern Plains, US Cattlemen's kind of Southwest.  And then NCBA is.  Ah, yeah.  
**[0:55:16-0:55:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:55:16):**  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.

They're going to be serving the big contract feed yards.  They're going to be serving the power in the industry, the concentrated power.  
**[0:55:31-0:55:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:55:31):**  So I heard it from Brett and I heard it from Don.  They both said the membership tells us what they want to support.  I get that.  
**[0:55:41-0:55:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:55:41):**  Totally get that.  Let's be transparent about where your members are.  Well, well, and also who they are and how much power they have as a member.  
**[0:55:50-0:56:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:55:50):**  I used to be a member of National Cattlemen's Association.  I was there that year in San Antonio in 96 when they merged the checkoff, which I opposed.  But I went to those meetings.  
**[0:56:03-0:56:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:56:03):**  I went to the ninth.  Well, I was at the 2001 NCBA meeting.  So I hung with them for five years after the merger.  
**[0:56:11-0:56:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:56:11):**  But when I was in a marketing committee meeting, I'd be the only guy speaking out and I'd be  getting shouted down by an IBP employee.  They were on the board now.  
**[0:56:22-0:56:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:56:22):**  And Bruce Bass would be sitting up in front of me in the aisle, gazing with his gaze,  going back to all those big cattle feeders, keeping their mouths shut.  Bruce Bass was the head buyer for IBP.  
**[0:56:34-0:56:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:56:34):**  So I was a member, but I, it didn't help me to show up.  The biggest and the strongest ran the organization.  That was the big meat packers.  
**[0:56:44-0:56:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:56:44):**  They ran the organization.  It was just sickening to see the head buyers of all these slaughterhouses, you know, at  the bar drinking together and laughing and, you know, calling Calacrate an idiot from  
**[0:56:57-0:57:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:56:57):**  the back row.  And I mean, we were being shouted down.  And the bottom line is Don Shufflebine's membership that runs the organization is the big meat  
**[0:57:09-0:57:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:57:09):**  packers and their partner, big feed yard people.  So it's not the cow calf guy.  So the cow calf people, they may be members of NCBA.  
**[0:57:21-0:57:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:57:21):**  I'd love to see a real membership list because I'm saying they got a whole lot fewer members  than they claim.  But Don Shufflebine's membership that he talks about that runs the organization is the big  
**[0:57:33-0:57:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:57:33):**  meat packers.  It is not cow calf people.  For to get that representation, you do have to go to our calf and you and the United States  
**[0:57:42-0:57:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:57:42):**  Cattlemen's Association.  Once they got some checkoff money, they got awfully quiet on the on the market concentration  problem and they got awfully quiet on on the protest around the checkoff and the misuse  
**[0:57:54-0:58:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:57:54):**  of those dollars.  And so I don't see the U.S. Cattlemen's Association being near strong enough for the cow man.  See, I think the only guy that really matters in this in this business right now is the  
**[0:58:07-0:58:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:58:07):**  cow calf producer.  If we don't have the calves being produced on these ranches, these farmer feeders aren't  going to have anything to put in their feedlots.  
**[0:58:16-0:58:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:58:16):**  The big feeders aren't going to have anything except for what they import out of Mexico  and Canada.  They honestly don't know when to quit being predators in the market.  
**[0:58:25-0:58:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:58:25):**  They don't know when to quit.  It's all about my self-interest in my short term profitability right now and that and  all of that is being given power through the checkoff financing the National Cattlemen's  
**[0:58:37-0:58:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:58:37):**  Beef Association.  And we keep picking them off.  So you give a little checkoff money to the U.S. Cattlemen's and they become a little  
**[0:58:44-0:58:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:58:44):**  weaker.  Our calf is the only organization that stands strong.  Brett Kinsey is awesome.  
**[0:58:49-0:58:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:58:49):**  He does a terrific job as president of that organization.  But he's he's up front.  He's got a front row seat in this industry.  
**[0:58:56-0:59:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:58:56):**  You know, he raises cattle and feeds cattle and he has to sell them to a damn meat packer.  And if you live that every day, you are you are fighting a war.  You get up every day having a look at the market to see how you're supposed to feel.  
**[0:59:11-0:59:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:59:11):**  And that is no way to live your life.  You it's got we've got to fix this thing.  And I think the first step that we have to take is not the compromise bill.  
**[0:59:22-0:59:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:59:22):**  My God, hold the phone on all of this legislation that's being proposed now right in these in  these ag committees.  Just stop it.  
**[0:59:29-0:59:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:59:29):**  Don't talk about it.  Grassley and Tester and and then and Frasier or Fisher from Nebraska.  Just be quiet and stop it.  
**[0:59:40-0:59:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:59:40):**  Withdraw it all.  And we've got to do one thing, just one thing.  We've got to reverse the confidentiality provision with take it out of the price reporting, mandatory  
**[0:59:50-0:59:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:59:50):**  price reporting, get rid of the confidentiality provision.  How does a market work with secret trades that are going on?  I'm saying you get rid of that.  
**[0:59:59-1:00:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=0:59:59):**  You get rid of that confidentiality rule and just let the ship fly.  It will be a firestorm when these cattle feeders find out what Paul Angler has been getting  for cattle for the last 30 years compared to what they were paying or getting paid.  
**[1:00:14-1:00:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:00:14):**  And they're all competing at the same sale market for feeder cattle.  If you knew the feedlots out there that were absolutely guaranteed a profit on every animal,  regardless of what the price does up or down, wouldn't you be mad when your little feedlot  
**[1:00:29-1:00:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:00:29):**  went broke and you played the fool's game all those years?  You'd want to get even with somebody.  I'm just saying make every single transaction totally transparent.  
**[1:00:40-1:00:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:00:40):**  Yeah, yeah, I get real upset, especially if I was feeding, you know, basically the same  cattle, the same thing for the same amount of days and they were yielding and grading  and weighing the same as the guy down the road, but I'm getting 20% less.  
**[1:00:59-1:01:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:00:59):**  And you know, Brian, I ran a commercial feedlot, the one I built in 1978 with my shareholder  friends in St. Francis, Kansas.  I ran that feedlot for eight years.  
**[1:01:10-1:01:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:01:10):**  When I started, we had 20 buyers we could sell to.  And then I left in about 1986 and things were not fun.  I mean, I felt like a transfer agent.  
**[1:01:22-1:01:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:01:22):**  I mean, you get these wonderful ranch families out of the Sandhills, Nebraska to bring you  cattle to be retained ownership, you know, cattle packs is talking about knowing your  genetics and, you know, knowing what your cattle can do.  
**[1:01:34-1:01:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:01:34):**  So you're part of that.  You're having steer futurities where people are bringing in, you know, several head of  their herd to test them and see what their genetics are doing.  
**[1:01:46-1:01:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:01:46):**  And you're all wrapped up in this total BS that the national cattlemen and cattle packs  and the big meat packers are promoting.  And all the while they're buying out their competitors, their predatory pricing, their  
**[1:01:59-1:02:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:01:59):**  competitors, their lying, their cheating, their stealing, they're violating the Packers  and Stockyards Act.  And all the while as a cattle feeder, a custom cattle feeder, I'm out there flying my airplane  
**[1:02:12-1:02:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:02:12):**  around trying to get cattle in my feedlot.  And in the end, I felt like a transfer agent.  I'm transferring the equity of their ranch to the meat packing industry as a cattle feeder.  
**[1:02:24-1:02:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:02:24):**  And of course, my, my interest was to keep my pens full.  You know, I've got to, I've got to get the throughput.  I've got to get the, the, the 25 cents a head of day yardage on those animals to where I  
**[1:02:35-1:02:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:02:35):**  can make my part work.  And so, you know, I've got to, I can't even see the reality for the financial demands.  And then as time passes, it gets harder and harder and harder to the point where Jim Keller  
**[1:02:50-1:03:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:02:50):**  down at Oakley feedlot, the Keller brother feed yard, they, they just, he just gives  up and he says, IBP, you can have my cattle and you tell me at the end of the week, what  you're going to pay me.  
**[1:03:04-1:03:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:03:04):**  And I don't have time to negotiate price with, with a bunch of meat packers that have more  power than I do.  And I, and I, and it does me no good.  
**[1:03:11-1:03:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:03:11):**  He says, just, you can have them.  And IBP might've said, Hey, yeah, that's great.  Mr. Keller, we'll give you 50 cents over the high of the week.  
**[1:03:20-1:03:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:03:20):**  And that was it.  And then more and more feedlots got more and more tired and they just started handing off  their cattle to these packers and, and letting Calacrate up in St. Francis and, and Dan Jones  
**[1:03:33-1:03:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:03:33):**  up in, up in Scott city, let us, that's the little guys with no power.  We're going to set the cash market for everybody.  And so the, so the industry dies.  
**[1:03:45-1:03:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:03:45):**  And when I, when I say we got to have transparency, we've got to get rid of the confidentiality  rule.  I want people to just see what the big feedlots are being paid to sell this industry out to,  
**[1:03:58-1:04:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:03:58):**  to eliminate competition and turn everybody into a chicken farmer, except worse.  You can't pay the mortgage on a ranch with two jobs in town.  Like you can a chicken house when you're under contract with Tyson.  
**[1:04:14-1:04:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:04:14):**  Yeah.  Yep.  So more small plants, more small plants are the answer.  
**[1:04:22-1:04:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:04:22):**  I mean, I did have written down here to ask you about 50, 14 and Fisher Grassley and the  contract library and the compromise bill, but like you kind of, that ship has sailed  so to speak.  
**[1:04:38-1:04:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:04:38):**  It has, but Brian, more small plants are not the answer without a market.  And right now nobody's talking about the market.  Look at, look at the Hertzog plant in Missouri.  
**[1:04:50-1:05:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:04:50):**  Good guys, Jim and Todd Hertzog.  What a terrific opportunity.  I mean, they saw COVID hit and they broke ground and they built a plant and then Hy-Vee,  
**[1:05:02-1:05:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:05:02):**  they got into Hy-Vee.  Well, Hy-Vee had, they had a bunch of empty shelves and they were in probably those local,  those local store managers saw a real opportunity in finding a local supplier that wasn't going  
**[1:05:13-1:05:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:05:13):**  to let them run out.  And so they, they got into some Hy-Vee's in Kansas city.  Until then things lightened up a little bit and the big packers were starting to flow  
**[1:05:23-1:05:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:05:23):**  a little more product into the big stores.  And they probably discovered that there was this little packer by the name of Hertzog  Meats out of Missouri that was in those darn IV stores.  
**[1:05:34-1:05:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:05:34):**  Well, we can't have that.  You can't have those guys buying outside of the system.  I mean, here I am Cargill, I've got all, I own the meat counter.  
**[1:05:44-1:05:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:05:44):**  Tyson owns the meat counter at the Walmart, poultry, pork, chicken, you know, the fake  meat, the whole thing.  We own it all.  
**[1:05:52-1:06:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:05:52):**  You can't be having a Hertzog come in and put up his little display.  I mean, my goodness, his product looks so much better than ours and that's so embarrassing,  you know?  
**[1:06:02-1:06:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:06:02):**  And so pretty soon, you know, Hertzog gets the phone call, Hy-Vee kicks them out.  So now what are they going to do?  Well, they can custom kill, but my gosh, how are you going to pay, you know, your labor?  
**[1:06:14-1:06:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:06:14):**  How are you going to cover your overhead with your custom kill?  You know, and there's just not enough volume there at good enough margins to be able to  make it work.  
**[1:06:27-1:06:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:06:27):**  And that's why the small plants went out of business to begin with.  That's why there aren't any is because they couldn't make a living, you know, doing custom  killing.  
**[1:06:35-1:06:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:06:35):**  And of course, if they brought in USDA, they had a whole another level of expense that  went on to the operation that I would estimate adds about a 30% increase in your costs because  everything slows down.  
**[1:06:50-1:07:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:06:50):**  You've got lots of paperwork to do.  You've got to hire extra staff to do that paperwork.  And for a small plant operator that actually had a knife in his hand, it was on the kill  
**[1:07:00-1:07:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:07:00):**  crew and was on the cut crew to process those carcasses into retail cuts that represented  a whole lot more expense for him and a whole lot more headache.  And you know, the last thing a guy with a knife in his hand wants to do is get on his  
**[1:07:14-1:07:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:07:14):**  laptop and fill out forms for USDA that don't make food safer.  And so, you know, USDA is in right now, in my opinion, is not serious about building  more small plants or promoting small plants.  
**[1:07:28-1:07:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:07:28):**  But the grants they're throwing out there are these massive, huge grants that can really  only be for plants that are going to be owned at some point by the big meat packers.  It might be a North Platte feeder, a North Platte plant, or it might be a Junction City  
**[1:07:46-1:07:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:07:46):**  plant or whatever it may be out there.  But without a market, without being able to sell to the consumer, none of those plants  are going to succeed.  
**[1:07:56-1:08:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:07:56):**  And the big packers then just get a more modern version of what they already have.  Okay, let's talk about like meat plant nuts and bolts for a little bit.  So how many times have you upgraded or expanded your plants?  
**[1:08:15-1:08:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:08:15):**  Well I've got, I started out with the mobile slaughter unit and we built a prototype in  conjunction with the socially responsible egg project, SRAP.  They funded the first mobile slaughter unit that I had in our cattle operation.  
**[1:08:31-1:08:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:08:31):**  And, you know, we didn't like it.  It wasn't designed right, which is always true with prototyping, right?  You always find better ways and make improvements.  
**[1:08:42-1:08:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:08:42):**  And that's part of the fun too.  And so, and this story of that mobile slaughter unit gets more interesting when you learn  that they were IBP's trailers.  
**[1:08:57-1:09:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:08:57):**  It was their tram trailers that they put the little packer out of business with.  So what happened when IBP introduced box beef, that meant they didn't want to sell carcasses  anymore.  
**[1:09:10-1:09:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:09:10):**  And so they convinced the big retailers to buy their carcasses and the small plants all  across the country that sold carcasses, like I used to see in the meat plant when I was  in high school, they didn't have market anymore.  
**[1:09:25-1:09:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:09:25):**  And so IBP came to them and said, well, hey, look, we've got excess boxing capacity.  We'll buy your carcasses.  And so IBP is going to buy the carcasses of the small plants that they compete for fat  
**[1:09:38-1:09:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:09:38):**  cattle with?  Really?  And the stockyards didn't see a problem with that.  
**[1:09:46-1:09:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:09:46):**  And nobody saw seemed to see a problem with that.  Well, they use these tram trailers to haul these whole half carcasses, not quarters,  half carcasses.  
**[1:09:55-1:10:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:09:55):**  So they needed a special tram door.  They had to build a new dock to back the trailer up to, and they had to use and then IBP would  haul these carcasses.  
**[1:10:04-1:10:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:10:04):**  And so the small packer wasn't selling quarters anymore.  He was simply really killing cattle for IBP and getting squeezed on in competing with  them for the live cattle.  
**[1:10:16-1:10:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:10:16):**  And I've got the set of notes from the IBP meeting where they plan this whole strategy.  And they said, we've got to move fast because we got to break them in a hurry and we got  to shut them down.  
**[1:10:30-1:10:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:10:30):**  And that's what they did with these tram trailers.  So here we've got these 55 foot long tram trailers that are extra tall and extra low  to the ground and specifically made to haul half carcasses in.  
**[1:10:41-1:10:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:10:41):**  And that's where you used to hear about that swinging beef being so dangerous to pull down  the road with a semi.  Because they literally did swing in those trailers and they were real top heavy.  
**[1:10:52-1:11:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:10:52):**  So what we did is we bought six of those trailers and converted them into mobile slaughter units.  So the first and second trailer that we did were in St. Francis, Kansas.  The first trailer went back to the East Coast to kill hogs.  
**[1:11:07-1:11:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:11:07):**  And so I got the second trailer, which was really cool.  We did everything on that trailer that we needed to do to fix it and make it better.  We could kill an animal every 20 minutes.  
**[1:11:17-1:11:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:11:17):**  The cooler on it would hold about 15 head.  And so you could fill the cooler every day.  And then one of the more innovative, getting back to Don Shufflebine, innovation, right?  
**[1:11:27-1:11:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:11:27):**  We added a six foot quartering section on the back of that trailer so that we could  quarter outside of the cooler.  Well, that gave us more room to hold two or three more head inside the cooler.  
**[1:11:40-1:11:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:11:40):**  And then back a truck up, a semi truck that hauled quarters, not halves, quarters.  And then we could quarter those carcasses and hang them in a rail trailer or put them  in tubs and haul them in a straight truck or whatever you wanted to do that was refrigerated.  
**[1:11:57-1:12:08](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:11:57):**  And so we were very innovative.  I mean, we think of cool stuff all the time.  And so that mobile slaughter unit was just really, really, we nailed it with that one.  
**[1:12:08-1:12:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:12:08):**  And then we, you know, a few more got built out.  And one of them is Wild Idea Buffalo up in Rapid City, South Dakota.  They kill buffalo.  
**[1:12:17-1:12:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:12:17):**  And they go right out onto the ranch like the picture behind you.  If those were buffalo, they'd be right out there and they'd shoot them where they stand,  you know, bleed them, put them in the cooler and then haul them back into town at the end  
**[1:12:31-1:12:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:12:31):**  of the day or at the end of the whatever days it took to fill the cooler.  But the mobile slaughter unit is definitely not the answer.  You can't afford to move them around.  
**[1:12:43-1:12:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:12:43):**  You've got to, you know, dock them, put them in one spot with a really good corral system  so you're not having a rodeo.  You want a good kill box.  
**[1:12:54-1:13:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:12:54):**  You want to be able to have a place to get rid of your slaughter waste, which makes the  feedlot make a lot of sense because you can, you know, bury it in the manure pile and then  compost it.  
**[1:13:06-1:13:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:13:06):**  You've got to get a way of, you've got to have a way of getting water to it and water  away from it.  And if you're in a feedlot like I am, you know, they consider the water coming out of  
**[1:13:15-1:13:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:13:15):**  the slaughter unit as agricultural waste.  And so we're able to utilize the existing runoff system in our feedlot and catchments  that we have there to catch that water.  
**[1:13:26-1:13:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:13:26):**  And so we sold that mobile slaughter unit.  It had been housed inside a new building that my son put up, Teagan, built, and it was really  good, it was serving its purpose and it was doing everything we wanted it to do.  
**[1:13:41-1:13:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:13:41):**  But COVID hit and we decided we really need to be able to kick up, you know, our slaughter.  And we just decided to, you know, we built the building, specifically designed it so  that we could put it in a slaughter floor at some point.  
**[1:13:59-1:14:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:13:59):**  Well now we've had five, six, seven years of experience slaughtering animals through  a mobile slaughter unit.  We pretty much knew what a new kind of a design would look like on a kill floor.  
**[1:14:11-1:14:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:14:11):**  And the building was designed with overhead doors and so forth to accommodate that.  And we sold the mobile slaughter unit to Northern Montana College under the Montana State University  system.  
**[1:14:28-1:14:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:14:28):**  Yeah, you were delivering that last time we talked.  Yeah, and it's going to be part of that meat cutting butchering curriculum up there.  It's going to be really cool what they do with that.  
**[1:14:37-1:14:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:14:37):**  But that is a really great unit.  It will, it'll be 15 cattle a day every day and, and, you know, four guys basically can  run that operation very, very efficiently.  
**[1:14:50-1:15:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:14:50):**  And so we sold the unit, we built a purpose built kill floor there in St. Francis that  is unlike any kill floor that that's out there.  It's, you talk about efficient and just seriously low cost.  
**[1:15:06-1:15:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:15:06):**  We use a skinning cradle, and we, you know, lift the animal to the, up with a hoist, and  that hoist is on a trolley on an I beam system, where it's moved along where it's gutted,  it's split.  
**[1:15:22-1:15:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:15:22):**  And then it's put on the rail, where we, where we do the final inspection, and we do an acid  spray for final pathogen control before those carcasses go into a 70 head cooler 30 on the  kill side on the drip side, and 40 head on the finished cooler side.  
**[1:15:42-1:15:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:15:42):**  And we're now pouring concrete here very soon for a new freezer and building a cut room  inside that building.  So we'll be able to move carcasses directly out of the, out of the coolers into the cut  
**[1:15:56-1:16:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:15:56):**  room so that we can help Colorado Springs keep up with carcass processing.  And so the animals we cut or kill for custom business in St. Francis can just stay there  and our kill crew will probably only work a couple three days a week and then cut on  
**[1:16:11-1:16:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:16:11):**  the other days.  But now we've got the capacity to do 30 cattle a day.  And that is such an ideal, such an ideal number, because you can you can service a plant like  
**[1:16:22-1:16:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:16:22):**  that with a 3500 head feedlot.  You could, you can keep all the slaughter waste on site.  You can make it into beautiful fertilizer that builds soil health.  
**[1:16:34-1:16:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:16:34):**  You can get rid of the water in good shape.  You can use 30 to 50 gallons of water per head per day, as opposed to the big meat packers  that are using over 700 gallons of water a day.  
**[1:16:48-1:17:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:16:48):**  You can, you can really level things out to where your kill crew becomes very skilled  and gets back to what a journeyman butcher was expected to do in 1980, which was hang  10 head of cattle in a cooler a day per man.  
**[1:17:02-1:17:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:17:02):**  And, you know, we're looking at four or five right now with our crew not being all that  highly skilled.  But that can improve with better, you know, with better, you know, training and all that.  
**[1:17:15-1:17:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:17:15):**  So we're really looking forward to the support of these curriculums, you know, getting kids  trained up to where they can come in and run plants like this.  And so, you know, IBP, you know, we're looking at four or five head a day per man.  
**[1:17:30-1:17:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:17:30):**  The journeyman butcher in 1980 was expected to hang 10 head a day by himself and GNC packing  company in fact, where we first started killing cattle 22 years ago, did in fact kill 40 head  a day with four butchers.  
**[1:17:43-1:17:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:17:43):**  And they did that consistently every week.  Tyson IBP are getting about 1.57 animals per man per day.  So they're getting they're getting less than, you know, 20% of what a skilled butcher got  
**[1:17:59-1:18:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:17:59):**  in 1980.  And like, I guess efficiencies.  I guess in 1980, they did have they didn't have power saws and band saws and oh, yeah,  
**[1:18:11-1:18:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:18:11):**  I guess they really had a Brian they were producing a carcass, not a box beat.  So they jump right in with that argument.  And I say, you know what, we're, we're killing at least we're twice as efficient as you are  
**[1:18:23-1:18:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:18:23):**  with our labor.  You know, when I talk about killing four to five animals per man today, and they're getting  1.57 at Garden City and Dakota City combined, and they say, Yeah, but we put it in a box.  
**[1:18:34-1:18:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:18:34):**  And my my answer to that is why?  Why Why aren't you shipping carcasses to butchers and grocery stores that know what they're  doing and can put it in a fresh counter?  
**[1:18:46-1:19:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:18:46):**  Why instead of zombies that just take it out of a box and put it in a counter?  Why don't we bring back the meat cutting skill and put it in retail stores again?  Well, the reason is, when IBP in about 1969, decided that the mafia out of New York City  
**[1:19:05-1:19:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:19:05):**  needed to, you know, pay their bill for the meat they'd been buying, loaded up and went  to New York and, and courier Holman and his, you know, for fellow, fellow executive met  with most time, who was head of the sort of the meat meat division of the New York mafia.  
**[1:19:28-1:19:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:19:28):**  And basically, they bribe the store executives, the grocery store executives to take box beef,  and they had to bribe the union as well, the union had to had to agree that they were going  to replace carcass beef with box beef.  
**[1:19:42-1:19:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:19:42):**  And that was going to result in about a 40% cut in wages.  While that interested the grocery store folks a bunch, they thought that was a great idea.  Well, the union probably didn't like it a whole lot.  
**[1:19:55-1:20:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:19:55):**  But you know, they were getting their pocket padded.  And the bottom line is, is courier Holman left New York with all the money that was  owed him.  
**[1:20:04-1:20:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:20:04):**  And in fact, he'd been threatened by the bank that they were going to have to shut IBP down  if he couldn't collect that receivable from New York.  And so basically, he struck a deal 50 cents a hundred way on all box beef that went into  
**[1:20:15-1:20:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:20:15):**  that region.  At the time, it was about 25% of all the meat consumed beef consumed in the United States  in that in that area.  
**[1:20:25-1:20:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:20:25):**  And so he came home and very proudly, you know, announced that, you know, that they  had the business and that they'd be shipping a whole lot of stuff into the New York area.  And then the law enforcement got involved in, of course, you know, it's going it's still  
**[1:20:40-1:20:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:20:40):**  going on today, but the law enforcement got involved and, and there were charges filed  because of the bribery and the dealing with the mafia.  And basically, the whole the whole deal was as the judge in the case did convict courier  
**[1:20:58-1:21:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:20:58):**  Holman of a felony count for that bribing and working with the mafia, but said, you  know what, he really didn't have a choice.  You know, the competitors, the other competitors were, you know, in order to compete in order  
**[1:21:14-1:21:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:21:14):**  to get, you know, his meat into New York, he really, he really had no choice but to  deal with the mafia.  And so, you know, courier, you're not going to get a jail sentence, and you're only going  
**[1:21:24-1:21:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:21:24):**  to have to pay $7,000 in fines.  That's what the judge did.  That sounds a whole lot like the judge in the in the IBP Tyson case that said, Hey,  
**[1:21:35-1:21:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:21:35):**  rule of reason, you know, they got to do what they got to do.  You know, we're not going to we're not going to enforce the law.  We're going to let them get away with it.  
**[1:21:43-1:21:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:21:43):**  And that's what they did.  And that is that is precisely how IBP got to where they are in the market today.  And eventually then became a part of Tyson.  
**[1:21:50-1:22:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:21:50):**  So you know, this is all based upon a lot of whole lot a whole lot of illegal acts that  law enforcement is completely and totally failed to to enforce the laws and there ought  to be people in jail.  
**[1:22:04-1:22:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:22:04):**  And one I like I really liked what the under the assistant attorney general said that one  of the hearings the other day is he said, I'm not I'm not going to be a member of the  chicken chick club.  
**[1:22:17-1:22:33](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:22:17):**  And the book was written called the chicken chick club and basically it's it's the Justice  Department and law enforcement being willing to settle cases instead of prosecute them  and actually get a felony count and maybe get some people put in jail.  
**[1:22:33-1:22:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:22:33):**  They're too willing to settle the cases like they did with JBS in the 52 and a half million  dollars.  So they really haven't changed their their motive of enforcement.  
**[1:22:43-1:22:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:22:43):**  It's pretty much still the same and they still are the chicken chick club.  But the reason it's called the chicken chick club is is the Comey James Comey was was presenting  to a group of state's attorneys general and he would raise he would ask them questions  
**[1:22:57-1:23:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:22:57):**  and they'd raise their hand and then he says, how many of you have never lost a case against  a big a big corporation?  And there'd be a bunch of hands go up.  
**[1:23:06-1:23:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:23:06):**  Oh, man, that's really awesome.  You know, or how many of you lost maybe just a few cases and so, you know, there'd be some  hands go up, they lost a few cases.  
**[1:23:15-1:23:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:23:15):**  And he says, Well, I just want you to know that you're all members.  All of you guys who raised your hand are members of the chicken chick club, because you didn't  actually try those cases, you settled those cases.  
**[1:23:28-1:23:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:23:28):**  That didn't fix a damn thing.  You've got to prosecute, you've got to break that market power that abusive market power.  And you know, of course, I don't know how much Comey did in that regard either.  
**[1:23:41-1:23:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:23:41):**  But but the whole attitude since Reagan especially has been was president is, is this D reg mentality  just just we don't need regulations.  But the runs we do get are anti small business, anti small meat packer, anti rancher anti,  
**[1:23:57-1:24:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:23:57):**  you know, cattle beater.  Well, of course, because, you know, the people that write those laws, they got to protect  the people that are donating to their campaigns.  
**[1:24:05-1:24:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:24:05):**  And that's right, screw the rest of us.  That's right.  So last week, I was, I went down to Fort Worth, the grass fed exchange, but a lot of really  
**[1:24:16-1:24:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:24:16):**  awesome fans.  I like it was really cool.  Everybody came up and said hi.  
**[1:24:23-1:24:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:24:23):**  But the the thing I want to talk to you about Mike is, I on the second day, I sat through  a couple breakout sessions about processing and processing at scale and and getting value  back out of carcasses.  
**[1:24:36-1:24:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:24:36):**  And one of the speakers that I listened to, he has a meat plant that he's expanded from  a fairly small operation, say 10 people.  Now he's got 150.  
**[1:24:52-1:25:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:24:52):**  And you know, they and I think they just do beef, but they also have, you know, cooked  products and sausage products and you know, hot dogs and things like that.  They do cuts, they do boxes.  
**[1:25:04-1:25:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:25:04):**  And I think they even they they'll even ship primals out of there.  Anyway, this gentleman was talking about capacity and scheduling.  And that is one of his biggest problems is making sure that he's got enough coming in  
**[1:25:22-1:25:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:25:22):**  the coming in the door to keep his cutters busy, because if he can't keep his cutters  busy, then that that snafus everything else down the line.  Okay, and I say that, because, you know, we talk on this podcast a lot about grass finishing  
**[1:25:40-1:25:50](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:25:40):**  and being regenerative.  And the first one we did, you said that, you know, you've only been able to finish like  one out of three years in St. Francis.  
**[1:25:50-1:26:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:25:50):**  And to be honest, it doesn't look good for this year again.  Like one out of 10.  I hate to say it, it doesn't look good to do a whole lot of grass finishing anywhere  
**[1:26:00-1:26:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:26:00):**  in Kansas this year.  But that is the problem, right?  That's part of the problem with trying to be a grass fed producer is knowing when that  
**[1:26:13-1:26:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:26:13):**  animal is going to be ready.  And having enough consistently that are going to be ready, you know, space through the year  that you can keep your processor happy.  
**[1:26:24-1:26:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:26:24):**  So I know you get around that by having a feedlot where you can control when those are  finishing to some degree.  And you know when they're going to be finished.  
**[1:26:39-1:26:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:26:39):**  And you also don't have to call around and look for a slot.  So what do you have to say about the seasonality of grass finishing and plant capacity?  Well, Brian, I love the idea of grass finished product.  
**[1:26:59-1:27:15](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:26:59):**  I mean, you get to bypass the feedlot, which is really good.  You know, if you can actually finish an animal on grass, that's beautiful.  But when you look at it from the perspective of what the risks are, like it doesn't rain,  
**[1:27:15-1:27:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:27:15):**  or you know, they just didn't finish this year for some reason, or we have grasses that  aren't conducive to finishing the animal.  They grow okay, but they don't finish them very well.  
**[1:27:28-1:27:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:27:28):**  That you've got some things that are in the way of making that program successful.  And so as a cattle feeder, you know, and a small plant operator, I can schedule my cattle  as long as I can feed them.  
**[1:27:47-1:28:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:27:47):**  I know they're going to be ready and from a perspective of a retail store owner as well,  I've got to know that I've got a consistent flow of product through to my retail customers  and wholesale customers as well.  
**[1:28:01-1:28:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:28:01):**  And so I can't depend on hoping it rains because like I said, in the last two out of the last  12 years, you could have probably finished cattle on grass, but they wouldn't have been  big enough for me to suit my program.  
**[1:28:14-1:28:27](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:28:14):**  And I probably would have liked to have put another couple hundred pounds on them, even  though they were in great shape coming off of grass.  And that really impacts the bottom line of profitability too, is if you can take those  
**[1:28:27-1:28:43](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:28:27):**  animals to their genetic potential, their genetically, you know, the right finish weight  for that, for the genetics of that animal, I think is important.  Otherwise we're wasting the animal's ability to produce food.  
**[1:28:43-1:28:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:28:43):**  But the way I, the really the way that I saw the grass fed thing cranking up to begin with  is Dale Lassiter.  Dale Lassiter at Matheson, Colorado, Lassiter grassland beef, and, and, you know, it was  
**[1:28:58-1:29:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:28:58):**  one fall Dale pre-checked his heifers and he had some open heifers and, you know, decided,  well, let's, let's sell some meat.  You know, those heifers are beautiful.  
**[1:29:09-1:29:12](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:29:09):**  They're fat.  They weren't, they aren't pregnant.  They put good weight on this summer.  
**[1:29:12-1:29:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:29:12):**  We had a great, you know, good, good season.  And so you kill those heifers and you hang those up in the cooler next to something that's  coming out of the feedlot.  
**[1:29:22-1:29:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:29:22):**  And honestly, you can't tell the difference because of that plane of nutrition was sufficiently  high that those, those open heifers really did a good job.  And they're at their, they're at their target weight.  
**[1:29:34-1:29:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:29:34):**  So they're weighing like 1150, maybe 1200 pounds.  And it's just totally the idea of grass fed product.  So it's got a lot of quality, it's got marbling in the meat.  
**[1:29:44-1:29:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:29:44):**  And so you go out there and you present that to your retail customer and they like it and  they want more of it.  Well, what if you got more demand than you have open heifers?  
**[1:29:54-1:30:04](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:29:54):**  Well now we're going to keep the steers over.  Well then we hit a drought, you know, or, or whatever.  And we're ended up, you know, we're killing feeder cattle at the end of the season instead  
**[1:30:04-1:30:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:30:04):**  of good high quality fat grass fed beef.  And so with a feedlot, at least you can, you can manage that and minimize that risk.  Like right now, I've got 300 cows that we run on our place.  
**[1:30:19-1:30:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:30:19):**  I would have had to sold them had I not had a feedlot.  I mean, I sure we did the corn stocks.  We went out and grazed it crop aftermath.  
**[1:30:28-1:30:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:30:28):**  We worked hard putting up electric fence all over the place to get those, keep those cows  and some feed.  But in the end, we had to bring them into the feedlot and feed them a cow ration, some  
**[1:30:37-1:30:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:30:37):**  cheap, you know, just some cheap hay and, and, and whatever else we could put together  to try to keep those costs down.  But at least we kept the cow herd.  
**[1:30:47-1:30:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:30:47):**  And these are special cows.  These are Angus cows bred to Wagyu bulls that are producing, you know, some of the most  beautiful meat you'll ever see in the world out of our operation.  
**[1:30:56-1:31:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:30:56):**  And so I see the feedlot is really making an operation even more regenerative.  You have a home yet you have that, what we would call in the grazing business, that sacrifice  pasture, you know, where you put the animals and they just, you know, they totally destroy  
**[1:31:11-1:31:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:31:11):**  it because there's too many in there for too long.  Well, that's what that's what a feedlot is for me, is I can bring those animals in and  it's sort of your sacrifice area.  
**[1:31:21-1:31:31](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:31:21):**  And now I can really let my grass come back and not put those out those animals out on  that grass too soon.  You know, I'm just able to manage so much better.  
**[1:31:31-1:31:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:31:31):**  And from the feedlot perspective, you know, I've got a really great water system there  that I can now pipe all my pastures to where, you know, I can run 600 head of cattle in  one group, move them around and not overtax my water system.  
**[1:31:44-1:31:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:31:44):**  And so now I've got the pounds per acre that I need to really get the impact I want.  But the feedlot is always there is that safety valve.  And now with the feedlot, I can slaughter those animals on site.  
**[1:31:59-1:32:07](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:31:59):**  So now I've got a comfortable place for those animals to be.  None of them have ever been on a truck in their entire life.  They've never left the place.  
**[1:32:07-1:32:21](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:32:07):**  And I can slaughter them on site, low stress, making meat quality even better.  And animal welfare, I mean, 100% better than what the others that go to a Tyson plant might  experience.  
**[1:32:21-1:32:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:32:21):**  And so now I can get in the meat business instead of the cattle business and avoid the,  you know, the meat packer monopoly.  And so that's really what it's done for me.  
**[1:32:29-1:32:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:32:29):**  And so when I see, and I see the absolute most efficient, best cattle operation, the  cattle feeding operation being the farmer feeder.  That's a Brett Kinsey.  
**[1:32:41-1:32:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:32:41):**  That's an Eric Nelson in Iowa.  These guys have the right size feedlots to support the feed, the crops that they grow.  And so we run our cows on grass, all those marginal acres that can do nothing but feed  
**[1:32:57-1:33:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:32:57):**  a cow.  And we run those cows on the grass, we bring them into these farmer feeder slots, where  all of that corn and hay and everything that was produced on that farm is fed to the livestock.  
**[1:33:10-1:33:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:33:10):**  So now they've maximized the value of their crop.  And that's what Shufflebine's doing too, remember his conversation.  And so you're putting your farm through the livestock.  
**[1:33:20-1:33:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:33:20):**  And then the big, the really big advantage is that manure then goes back on the land  that the crops came off of.  We even put it on our pastures.  
**[1:33:30-1:33:41](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:33:30):**  So you know, and by the time, by the time that manure gets out back on those pastures,  it's already, it's got biochar added to it.  It's got all the slaughter waste that's been added to it.  
**[1:33:41-1:33:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:33:41):**  It's a powerful compost product, but that's made possible with the feedlot.  And so I manage a lot, a lot of the risk in the industry, or my business is managed with  the feedlot.  
**[1:33:53-1:34:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:33:53):**  And so, so now I've got a carcass going, going to a meat shop.  But you know, go back to Shufflebine.  I mean, he's, I just described his operation.  
**[1:34:02-1:34:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:34:02):**  You know, he's producing cattle, he's feeding the byproducts, and he's selling that product  to a meat packer.  But if you're doing all of that, and you've been all really innovative, and you're efficient  
**[1:34:13-1:34:23](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:34:13):**  and all that stuff, and you got a lot of family labor in the deal, aren't you the lowest cost  producer?  Way lower than the big feedlot that's hiring all their help and feeding $8 corn, you're  
**[1:34:23-1:34:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:34:23):**  way more efficient.  That's more by far the most ideal operation.  But if you're selling into a monopolized market, and now instead of getting paid for the corn  
**[1:34:32-1:34:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:34:32):**  that you grew that went through the cattle, you're giving it away with losses on the cattle.  Your kids that work on the operation, they're not getting paid, the family's not getting  paid, you're going to the bank, you need to borrow money to pay the interest.  
**[1:34:47-1:35:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:34:47):**  You know, this is the business we've been in the last 30 some years.  In my vision of the future, where we can connect producers more closely to consumers, fixes  that problem.  
**[1:35:00-1:35:05](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:35:00):**  We have to fix that problem.  How many of these kids want to come back?  None of them.  
**[1:35:05-1:35:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:35:05):**  None of them.  You can't make a living.  And none of them will until we fix it.  
**[1:35:09-1:35:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:35:09):**  That's right.  So kind of about the last thing on my list is, and this really probably shouldn't even  be on my list, because I know you've talked about it before.  
**[1:35:22-1:35:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:35:22):**  I wanted to give you an opportunity to address working with the Humane Society of the United  States.  Because I, this was a couple weeks ago, there was, I can't remember what it was, there was  
**[1:35:35-1:35:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:35:35):**  somebody that was really, really hot on Facebook about, well, what does Mike think about this?  What does Mike think about this?  Well, what does he say about working with the Humane Society of the United States?  
**[1:35:46-1:35:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:35:46):**  And honestly, I just linked in the last podcast episode that we did, because I'm not your  spokesman, right?  Right, sure.  
**[1:35:56-1:36:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:35:56):**  Yeah, good.  But I'll at least give you another platform again, to address the haters that are upset  that you might have agreed with some things that the HSUS has said.  
**[1:36:09-1:36:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:36:09):**  Yeah, and you know, one of the real effective tools of the monopoly, the food monopoly is  to divide people, get them to fighting over stuff that doesn't matter.  And that way, we can continue to pick their pockets and exploit them.  
**[1:36:24-1:36:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:36:24):**  And so that that's just a just a basic tool that they use very, very effectively.  But I'll never forget that that year I went to RCAP.  I can't remember how long ago it was, it was, it was probably 10 or more years ago by now.  
**[1:36:38-1:36:56](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:36:38):**  And in RCAP is this little group of cow calf producers, you know, some, some farmer feeders  involved and guys like myself that be calor involved, but they're, they're really focused  on market concentration issues, the big deal for our calf is, how do we get a fair price  
**[1:36:56-1:37:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:36:56):**  for what we produce?  How do we restore competition?  And it really comes down to a political problem.  
**[1:37:03-1:37:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:37:03):**  You know, we've talked about how Congress is owned by big corporations.  And the only thing that beats that relationship is a vote.  That's the only thing that beats a lobbyist is the voters, kicking the guy out, and or  
**[1:37:17-1:37:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:37:17):**  at least having that serious threat of kicking the guy out.  And so I always encouraged the RCAP leadership to look to the consumer to partner with, try  to get the consumer on your side, let them know that their food best comes from an independent  
**[1:37:36-1:37:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:37:36):**  family farm and ranch, and a farmer feeder operation as opposed to the big, the big,  you know, corporate model.  And they did that.  
**[1:37:47-1:38:01](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:37:47):**  I mean, they, they really, they got with the Consumers Union.  And I think, you know, we're starting to really do some good partnerships with with some of  the consumer groups, I think Food and Water Watch, where Paddy Lavera was good friends  
**[1:38:01-1:38:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:38:01):**  at the time and presented on RCAP conventions on some of their panels.  And I said, but look, guys, there is an organization out there that likes animals.  How many in this room?  
**[1:38:14-1:38:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:38:14):**  How many ranchers in this room don't like animals?  You know, you've got you've got some things potentially in common with the Humane Society  of the United States, who, who, what's his name, the, the Mr. Evil guy from 60 Minutes,  
**[1:38:30-1:38:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:38:30):**  the, the big backer of Farm Bureau, Berman, Rick Berman, you know, he's got Humane Watch  the whole website that makes the Humane Society bad.  But you know, that's another wedge kind of sort of a project to divide people.  
**[1:38:47-1:39:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:38:47):**  But I said, think about this, the best steward, the best husbandman is a rancher, a family  farmer, a farmer raising pigs in, you know, out out in the pasture in a hut.  I mean, the pigs are happy, the farmers happy, the kids are in 4-H, everybody's making a  
**[1:39:06-1:39:17](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:39:06):**  little money, it's working, it's working good.  And that's the right way to raise a hog.  And, and, and I said, and how many of you can agree that it's a good idea to put a sow  
**[1:39:17-1:39:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:39:17):**  in a two by seven crate, and they don't and they never get to turn around?  How many of you think that's a great way to raise it to raise pigs?  And how many of you think it's a great way to raise chickens to put them in a battery  
**[1:39:28-1:39:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:39:28):**  cage with other hands and they can't even spread their wings?  How many of you think that's a good idea?  Well, animal science research said that that was the safest, most humane way to do it,  
**[1:39:39-1:39:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:39:39):**  Mike.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.  But a rancher knows better.  
**[1:39:42-1:39:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:39:42):**  I mean, they're not going to do that to their cattle, you know, it's better husbandry, they're  the stewards of the land.  Well, it so happens that the Humane Society had decided at that time, that they might  
**[1:39:57-1:40:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:39:57):**  be better off supporting family farmers and ranchers, as opposed to just, you know, fighting  agriculture and many of the practices that we consider inhumane, like the sow in a gestation  crate in the in the chicken in a in a battery cage, and 150,000 head of cattle in one spot.  
**[1:40:20-1:40:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:40:20):**  And when it when it's when the snowstorm comes by the third day, they still aren't fed, or  they're in mud up to their butt and they're losing, you know, a whole lot of cattle, as  opposed to Eric Nelson and Brett Kinsey's yards.  
**[1:40:34-1:40:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:40:34):**  They were fed the next day after the blizzard, right?  And all the kids were out there scooping bunks.  And I mean, you talk about humane care and quality care to animals, that's where you're  
**[1:40:44-1:40:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:40:44):**  going to get it.  And so basically, the Humane Society came to myself and Joe Maxwell and some of us producers,  and they said, Don't we have something in common here?  
**[1:40:53-1:41:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:40:53):**  There's 11 million of us and we vote.  Don't we have something in common here?  Could we work together to support family farm agriculture and really do a better, more effective  
**[1:41:03-1:41:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:41:03):**  job of fighting the factory farm side that's so exploitive of ranchers and producers and  farm workers and all that?  And we said, Yeah, why don't we just give it a shot?  
**[1:41:13-1:41:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:41:13):**  And so I suggested that year in our cap, that, that the Humane Society and their 11 million  members might be a pretty good collaboration.  And of course, it didn't go anywhere, but it got said, and then we just went right on  
**[1:41:29-1:41:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:41:29):**  and we we developed some, some state groups, some advisory groups that would advise the  Humane Society on policy.  And so I did a chart one time and I basically it was it was the organization like like our  
**[1:41:44-1:42:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:41:44):**  cap and CBA, the NC or the Humane Society, and just where they stood on certain policy.  And it was interesting because on country of origin labeling mandatory price reporting,  you know, market concentration, really these seriously important policies, Humane Society  
**[1:42:06-1:42:19](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:42:06):**  was 100% in alignment with our cap.  And NCPA was on the other side with the meat packers.  And so, you know, we were really making the case that, you know, this would be a pretty  
**[1:42:19-1:42:34](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:42:19):**  good group, you know, to, to perhaps align with and get them in when they hit the hill  on in DC, DC feels it.  I mean, when they're lobbyists, and they're, you know, animal lovers hit the hill, I guarantee  
**[1:42:34-1:42:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:42:34):**  you there's passion there.  There's there's a lot of volume to their voice, and the hill listens.  And so we really did do some good there for a little bit.  
**[1:42:45-1:42:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:42:45):**  And then we got crossways.  What happened was the Humane Society had partnered with Whole Foods on the on gap certification,  the global animal partnership thing.  
**[1:42:58-1:43:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:42:58):**  And it was deceptive.  It was misleading, and we felt as advisors to the Humane Society through this advisory  group, that they shouldn't be a part of that what we thought was food fraud.  
**[1:43:13-1:43:30](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:43:13):**  And we were never able to break the connection between the Humane Society and Whole Foods  global animal partnership, which is which was a certification program that Whole Foods  imposed upon their suppliers that wasn't being held up to the to the stated standards.  
**[1:43:30-1:43:45](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:43:30):**  It was more of a marketing thing for Whole Foods to be able to sell to their consumers.  And honestly, they were just producing, you know, regular feedlot factory farm product  and putting, you know, what we what I thought was a fake label on it.  
**[1:43:45-1:43:55](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:43:45):**  Many of us other many of the other folks in the group thought was a fake label as well.  And so we ended up parting ways.  You know, I'm no longer on an advisory panel with with HSUS.  
**[1:43:55-1:44:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:43:55):**  I don't see them as a threat to the kind of agriculture that I want.  But I see them not being willing to do address what I thought was a fatal fatal flaw in their  relationship on the gap certification thing.  
**[1:44:09-1:44:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:44:09):**  And it was just to me, it was a question of, you know, they have that they had to decide  if they thought their relationship with Whole Foods was was more important than their relationship  with their family farm and ranch advisory group.  
**[1:44:24-1:44:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:44:24):**  We ended up just parting ways.  But still, Brian, I think we did a lot of good during those years of really earning  some trust of a lot of the membership of HSUS.  
**[1:44:36-1:44:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:44:36):**  I mean, like Kevin Fulton would go and present to their annual meeting.  And I mean, he he's a you know, Kevin, I mean, he's an awesome operator out of out of Nebraska  regenerative for sure, like multi species livestock producer.  
**[1:44:51-1:45:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:44:51):**  And he literally would get a standing applause at an HSUS board meeting.  There'd be six, seven hundred people in the room.  And I was there and I witnessed it.  
**[1:45:00-1:45:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:45:00):**  I mean, they loved Kevin Fulton.  Sure there's a lot of vegetarians in the room, but you got to ask yourself, why are they  a vegetarian?  
**[1:45:09-1:45:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:45:09):**  And for the HSUS member or supporter, it's going to be the way animals are treated.  And I think that that's a very important point.  You said it where they're not against the kind of agriculture that we want to do.  
**[1:45:25-1:45:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:45:25):**  Right?  That's right.  They don't they don't like seeing those 50 and 70,000 head feedlots with, you know, a  
**[1:45:32-1:45:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:45:32):**  20 acre shit pond.  They don't like seeing the quarter million head chicken bar, the 10,000 head hog barn,  which I think just about everybody that listens to this podcast is going to agree that shit's  
**[1:45:44-1:45:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:45:44):**  gross.  That's right.  Especially pig, especially hogs.  
**[1:45:49-1:45:58](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:45:49):**  You know, they're really bad.  And I mean, you when you stack them up and combine them the way that Iowa has done, it  makes the place unlivable.  
**[1:45:58-1:46:11](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:45:58):**  And no family farmer wants to, you know, not be able to cook a steak out on his on his  back deck in the evenings.  You know, they would, you know, except, you know, he can't stand the hog smell of all  
**[1:46:11-1:46:20](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:46:11):**  the barns that are that are on his property line.  So you know, we've got to fix this.  And I think we have to be willing to work with others and don't don't let Rick Berman,  
**[1:46:20-1:46:32](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:46:20):**  you know, drive the wedge and and try to divide us to make us weaker.  The fact is, the way we win is we win by coming together and we win with a boat.  And to me, we've got it.  
**[1:46:32-1:46:44](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:46:32):**  We've got it.  I loved with with one of the old talking heads in Washington said the other day he said,  you know, we just really need the old people to leave.  
**[1:46:44-1:47:00](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:46:44):**  And he's talking about the Nancy Pelosi's the Joe Biden, the the guy in the Senate,  Mitch McConnell, Mitch McConnell, these guys really honestly and truly need to retire.  They're part of the problem.  
**[1:47:00-1:47:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:47:00):**  They're part of the Wall Street Congress partnership instead of the People Congress partnership.  And honestly, they do need to go.  I mean, get some young people in there that that add more energy and have a better perspective  
**[1:47:16-1:47:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:47:16):**  of where the future ought to lie for for for Americans and get rid of all this corruption  that just won't ever end.  We just keep covering more and more of it up every day.  
**[1:47:28-1:47:37](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:47:28):**  Maybe turn limits to.  Yeah.  You know, I know there's some benefit in some, you know, some wisdom among some leadership.  
**[1:47:37-1:47:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:47:37):**  But but man, these guys are hanging around way too long.  I mean, I mean, poor old Mitch McConnell really needs to go spend some time with his grandkids.  They'll be in college before they'll have the great grandkids.  
**[1:47:54-1:48:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:47:54):**  Yeah, yeah.  So anyway, I you know, I just one more point on that HSUS thing.  When I was in the lawsuit against IBP and we were in Alabama, you know, working on the  
**[1:48:06-1:48:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:48:06):**  case and I met I met an attorney, Buck Watson was his name.  And Buck Watson, it was a really successful plaintiff's lawyer from Alabama and was very  political.  
**[1:48:16-1:48:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:48:16):**  And they were down there talking about blue dogs and, you know, Blue Dog Democrats and  different all this stuff.  And and, you know, a Blue Dog Democrat was I'd rather vote for a blue dog than a Democrat  
**[1:48:28-1:48:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:48:28):**  or whatever.  I forget all that stuff.  But they had all these categories that they would put you in.  
**[1:48:35-1:48:47](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:48:35):**  You know, you're either a conservative Democrat or a liberal Democrat or you're, you know,  a Republican, this or that.  And so Buck Watson said to me one day, he said, you know, Mike, we were talking about  
**[1:48:47-1:48:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:48:47):**  politics.  He says, you know, Mike, politics is about addition, not subtraction.  That was my message to our care.  
**[1:48:57-1:49:10](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:48:57):**  Who can you collaborate with?  Who can you coordinate your effort with to where you can get power again?  And let's try to do something before we have a complete meltdown of the current system,  
**[1:49:10-1:49:28](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:49:10):**  which is coming in, which has already happened and we haven't done anything about it yet.  Let's let's really try to fix this mess right now, as soon as we possibly can.  I want my grandkids to come back to that farming and cattle operation in St. Francis.  
**[1:49:28-1:49:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:49:28):**  My kids didn't want to come back because they saw how awful the eighties were.  It was in and how, you know, the eighties were bad though.  I mean, the eighties really bad.

**[1:49:48-1:49:57](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:49:48):**  Well, that just drove me to want to make it better.  How do we carve out like Brett Kinsey called it?  He says, you need a lifeboat.  
**[1:49:57-1:50:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:49:57):**  And for me, Ranch Foods Direct has been my lifeboat.  It's cost money, but at least it's a lifeboat and it keeps me running, hopefully to get  to a better place on land at some point where a lot of us could be doing what I'm doing.  
**[1:50:13-1:50:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:50:13):**  And a lot of us can be connecting back to those consumers more directly.  And that's why I'm really excited about this project that I told you about at the very  first of the podcast is if we can build these little local regional food villages and take  
**[1:50:26-1:50:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:50:26):**  care of the producer, the small business guy that's the Miller of the grains from the region.  And think about it, Miller being in a little village like that.  He's got the Baker, the distiller, the brewer, he's got the pie maker.  
**[1:50:39-1:50:46](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:50:39):**  He's got how much done demand has he got for flour in that place?  A bunch.  And it's going to be stone ground.  
**[1:50:46-1:50:53](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:50:46):**  It's not going to be like what Cargill and ADM produce.  It's going to be a healthy, better flower.  It's not going to have GMOs involved.  
**[1:50:53-1:51:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:50:53):**  It's not going to have Roundup involved.  It's going to be amazing.  He's going to go buy the heirloom grain from the guy down the road that only planted 40  
**[1:51:02-1:51:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:51:02):**  acres as a test.  And it's going to be some weird ancient variety that nobody's grown for 150 years.  And it's going to be a funny color.  
**[1:51:09-1:51:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:51:09):**  It'll be so damn delicious.  Everybody will want it.  And he's going to pay too much, I hope.  
**[1:51:14-1:51:25](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:51:14):**  Yes.  And the consumer is still going to get a great deal on that loaf of bread.  Have you ever picked up a loaf of real sourdough and in one hand and a loaf of Wonder Bread  
**[1:51:25-1:51:35](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:51:25):**  in the other?  I don't know if I've directly done that comparison, but I have had sourdough made from Turkey  Red.  
**[1:51:35-1:51:40](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:51:35):**  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  We're talking about sourdough boulangerie in Colorado Springs.  
**[1:51:40-1:51:49](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:51:40):**  He's going to be in the village.  He's going to be the baker.  And I got to just tell you that I mean, the loaf of sourdough that Shawn makes with sourdough  
**[1:51:49-1:51:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:51:49):**  boulangerie is so much heavier.  I mean, it's real food.  Yeah.  
**[1:51:54-1:52:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:51:54):**  And you know what?  You don't have a gluten intolerance to it because it's sourdough.  He fermented the grain.  
**[1:52:02-1:52:13](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:52:02):**  Those grains have a built in protective device.  They don't want you eating them.  And so with sourdough and the fermentation process, you can eliminate, pretty much eliminate  
**[1:52:13-1:52:22](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:52:13):**  that problem.  So anyway, that's what I want to surround myself with is good food and people who make  good food and grow good commodities.  
**[1:52:22-1:52:38](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:52:22):**  That's and I think that's something that we can all try to surround ourselves with is  a community that is centered around providing food for each other.  Well, we've got the why we do it in front of us.  
**[1:52:38-1:52:51](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:52:38):**  And from baby formula to everything else that goes in our diet.  So I think it's time I think it's time to come together and build some true local regional  infrastructure that serves people instead of corporations.  
**[1:52:51-1:52:59](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:52:51):**  Yes, for sure.  I'm really excited to follow along and see how you build your food village, Mike.  We'll keep it we'll keep you informed.  
**[1:52:59-1:53:03](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:52:59):**  Yep.  All right.  Where do you want anywhere you want to send people today?

And, and, you know, you can check out the blog, I got a listserv and just almost everything  else I do there is somehow represented from, you know, from Ranch Foods Direct to the Calcrate  
**[1:53:17-1:53:26](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:53:17):**  cattle company, but we do for a regenerative program, you know, when you when you can make  money, you can really be regenerative.  Yeah, yeah, for sure.  
**[1:53:26-1:53:36](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:53:26):**  So I missed you at Grass Fed Exchange.  I think the next one coming up on the calendar.  That's more than a couple weeks out.  
**[1:53:36-1:53:42](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:53:36):**  Let's see our calf convention.  August in Deadwood, South Dakota.  Yes.  
**[1:53:42-1:53:48](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:53:42):**  Are you gonna go?  Yeah, I'll be there.  I think I might, I might have to do that.  
**[1:53:48-1:53:54](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:53:48):**  Plane tickets out of Dodge City are half of what they are out of Wichita.  You can really Yeah.  Would that be a problem?  
**[1:53:54-1:54:06](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:53:54):**  Maybe with some concentration consolidation issues of monopoly power?  I think it's, I think it's federally subsidized tickets out of Dodge City.  Yeah.  
**[1:54:06-1:54:14](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:54:06):**  Yeah.  But but the Yeah, that's Yeah, that's exactly what it is like Cara springs is starting to  get more flights, which is really good.  
**[1:54:14-1:54:24](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:54:14):**  But but united has way too much power at the FBI.  You know, they control gates and it makes it hard.  More monopoly power.  
**[1:54:24-1:54:29](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:54:24):**  What else?  Quivira is regenerate, probably back in Albuquerque this year.  You go into that one.  
**[1:54:29-1:54:39](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:54:29):**  Yeah, I usually try to get there.  Okay, go ahead, slowed me down a little bit from going.  Well, two opportunities to see this year.  
**[1:54:39-1:54:52](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:54:39):**  I'm gonna I'm gonna really look into making that.  You know, our calf up and dead, but I think that'll be really good time.  It's gonna kind of depend on when my summer help has to go back to college because I think  
**[1:54:52-1:55:02](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:54:52):**  it's either that week or the week before or the week after.  So if he's going back to college, that means I've got to go back to work.  Well, good luck.  
**[1:55:02-1:55:09](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:55:02):**  I hope that works out.  Because our calves are good, really good.  We'll see if we can make it work.  
**[1:55:09-1:55:16](https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/66-Mike-Callicrate-4-Building-a-Food-Village-e1j6q81#t=1:55:09):**  And I think with that, we're gonna go ahead and get out of here.  Mike, so he's been a always, always awesome.  Thanks for joining me.

### Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food  (Tue, 30 Nov 2021 17:00:00)
## 142 Maddie Akkermans on changing the weather systems in the Middle East through regeneration at scale  
**[0:00:00-0:00:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:00:00):**  We often talk about scale in regeneration, but there are very few projects that I know  
**[0:00:04-0:00:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:00:04):**  of that operate at this scale.  
**[0:00:07-0:00:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:00:07):**  What if we could re-green the Sinai desert, and not only bring back an ecosystem full  
**[0:00:12-0:00:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:00:12):**  of abundance, think a lot of fish, plants, trees and thousands of people living healthily  
**[0:00:17-0:00:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:00:17):**  and happily, but by restoring the local water cycle we can influence the weather patterns  
**[0:00:22-0:00:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:00:22):**  in most of the Middle East and the Mediterranean.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:00:25):**  Sounds like science fiction, listen and learn why and how we need to think and act at scale.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:00:33):**  Tempering climate change, bringing back rivers, preventing floods and obviously lots and lots  
**[0:00:38-0:00:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:00:38):**  of nutrient-dense food.  
**[0:00:39-0:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:00:39):**  The promises of REGEN-AC often sound straight out of a science fiction book.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:00:44):**  And for these promises to be met, we need to significantly scale regeneration to a landscape  
**[0:00:49-0:00:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:00:49):**  scale within this decade.  
**[0:00:52-0:00:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:00:52):**  Welcome to a new series where we look into the technologies needed to bring regeneration  
**[0:00:56-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:00:56):**  to a landscape scale.  
**[0:00:58-0:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:00:58):**  In this series we'll look at already existing technologies, digital tech, ag tech, new financing  
**[0:01:03-0:01:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:01:03):**  mechanisms etc. that can scale fast enough during the next 10 years.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:01:07):**  Technologies which put significantly more money into the pockets of farmers, landowners  
**[0:01:11-0:01:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:01:11):**  and land stewards who are regenerating their and our soils so they can go faster.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:01:17):**  And we'll ask the question, what is missing?  
**[0:01:19-0:01:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:01:19):**  What needs to be urgently developed over the next years?  
**[0:01:22-0:01:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:01:22):**  We're very happy with the support for this series by the Grantham Environmental Trust,  
**[0:01:26-0:01:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:01:26):**  which supports strategic communications and collaboration in solving the world's most

**[0:02:01-0:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:02:01):**  Thank you.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:02:02):**  Welcome to another episode today with Maddie Ackermans, the co-founder of The Weathermakers.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:02:07):**  The weathermakers strive to develop watershed-wide ecosystem regeneration by influencing the  
**[0:02:12-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:02:12):**  vegetation to increase freshwater availability through land atmospheric processes.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:02:18):**  Welcome Maddie.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:02:19):**  Thank you Koen for having me.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:02:20):**  To start with a personal question, I have a lot to ask obviously on The Weathermakers,  
**[0:02:24-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:02:24):**  but what brings you to The Weathermakers and to take on such an ambitious soil, but actually  
**[0:02:30-0:02:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:02:30):**  way beyond soil regeneration process?  
**[0:02:32-0:02:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:02:32):**  What led you to joining The Weathermakers, co-founding The Weathermakers and going very  
**[0:02:35-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:02:35):**  deep in this topic?  
**[0:02:37-0:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:02:37):**  The friendship with Thies, I would say.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:02:39):**  Thies was requested to think about Barleyville Lake and the location that we will discuss  
**[0:02:44-0:02:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:02:44):**  a little bit more on later regarding is it possible to regenerate the lake and create  
**[0:02:48-0:02:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:02:48):**  more fish for the people around the lake also to feed and have an economy, etc.  
**[0:02:54-0:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:02:54):**  And during that time, he spent a lot of time at my dining table as we had a family with  
**[0:02:58-0:03:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:02:58):**  children and a scheme each day and he was by himself.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:03:03):**  So he tended to sit at my table and discuss.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:03:07):**  And I was able in that time to bring a little bit the testaments to the story.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:03:11):**  So we're talking about the Sinai where many of our religious books are situated partly.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:03:18):**  So I was able to bring that kind of knowledge to the table and it triggered me a lot to  
**[0:03:23-0:03:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:03:23):**  reread a lot of the texts.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:03:26):**  And by the time that he needed to start his own company because it was too ambitious and  
**[0:03:29-0:03:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:03:29):**  too green for the company that he worked at that time, he asked me to take up the management  
**[0:03:35-0:03:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:03:35):**  of the company.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:03:37):**  And of course, this is such an amazing vision, so I was very happy to say yes.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:03:42):**  And I didn't think about it a lot.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:03:44):**  So really knowing why it just resonated with me.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:03:48):**  So here I am.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:03:50):**  Because it's not that you've been in the Sinai.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:03:53):**  We're talking about the Sinai, which is currently part of Egypt.  
**[0:03:55-0:03:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:03:55):**  But just go to Google Maps and envision it's a massive place.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:03:59):**  Mostly seems desert at the moment, but there's a lot of opportunity.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:04:02):**  But we'll get to that later.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:04:03):**  It's not that you've been there very often that the place resonated with you.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:04:06):**  Apart from the religious connection, obviously, but it's not that you were a very frequent  
**[0:04:11-0:04:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:04:11):**  Egypt visitor or something like that.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:04:13):**  It was more than that, but it wasn't specifically the place, I think, or at least you haven't  
**[0:04:17-0:04:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:04:17):**  you weren't visiting there very often before you joined and co-founded the weathermakers.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:04:22):**  I have no ecology background.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:04:24):**  I have no biology background, no technical background.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:04:27):**  So for me, it's a far fetched choice, let's say.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:04:31):**  I do have good connection with deers, I would say.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:04:35):**  So a lot of my choices I make by that energy.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:04:39):**  And since we started this, I did visit the Sinai.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:04:43):**  And I can say that the earth energy at that location is very high frequency.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:04:48):**  So I do think that probably assisted in me coming to this path.  
**[0:04:54-0:04:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:04:54):**  But no, it is a far fetched choice, but very willingly taken.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:04:59):**  And just for people, I will link a great Guardian article on what you're trying to achieve,  
**[0:05:04-0:05:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:05:04):**  but in a few sentences, which is very difficult, but for the people that didn't read that yet,  
**[0:05:08-0:05:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:05:08):**  or haven't ever heard of the weathermakers, what are you trying to achieve in your first  
**[0:05:14-0:05:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:05:14):**  project?  
**[0:05:15-0:05:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:05:15):**  I'm imagining there will be others following.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:05:16):**  You're very ambitious in that sense.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:05:18):**  But what are in a few sentences, what is the central theme of the project in the Sinai?  
**[0:05:24-0:05:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:05:24):**  Our central theme is water.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:05:25):**  So you started in the introduction about soil, few sentences, so I won't say too much.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:05:31):**  But water is the central point of view for us, and we want to heal the water cycle.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:05:35):**  So we're really talking about creating such natural systems that the water cycle itself  
**[0:05:42-0:05:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:05:42):**  will take over and create enough moist for the whole system to heal and become abundant.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:05:51):**  And to have us that not needed in the system anymore.  
**[0:05:54-0:05:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:05:54):**  Well, as the weathermakers, but people, of course, are part of the system.  
**[0:05:58-0:05:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:05:58):**  We are part of nature.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:05:59):**  Yeah, and this is a place where I'm imagining many people envisioned or they see desert  
**[0:06:06-0:06:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:06:06):**  when they see the place.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:06:07):**  There's a very shallow lake that used to be a lot deeper.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:06:09):**  And that's one of the central places where you are planning an intervention or already  
**[0:06:13-0:06:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:06:13):**  doing actually a smaller intervention.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:06:16):**  But I think many people and that's actually the title of the that article as well.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:06:20):**  Our biggest challenge is the lack of imagination.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:06:23):**  Many people see a desert or see a landscape as well.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:06:25):**  We talk about regeneration in other places, Australia, but also here in Europe and the  
**[0:06:29-0:06:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:06:29):**  US and sort of assume it always was like that, even though it's degrading in front of our  
**[0:06:33-0:06:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:06:33):**  eyes.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:06:34):**  How do you is a very big question.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:06:35):**  How do you trigger people on that imagination?  
**[0:06:38-0:06:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:06:38):**  How do you make people join you on the journey?  
**[0:06:41-0:06:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:06:41):**  You joined this and you were triggered enough by that imagination to see more than the sand  
**[0:06:46-0:06:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:06:46):**  and more than the desert and more than a shallow lake that is pretty basically dead.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:06:49):**  And you actually see the potential of a lot more life, fish, restoring water cycles, vegetation,  
**[0:06:54-0:06:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:06:54):**  very lush, etc.  
**[0:06:56-0:06:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:06:56):**  How do you trigger that imagination in other people?  
**[0:06:57-0:07:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:06:57):**  Because you must have done it a few times because you have quite a large team now, a  
**[0:07:01-0:07:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:07:01):**  lot of other people supporting you.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:07:03):**  How do you trigger that imagination in people to see more than a degraded landscape?  
**[0:07:07-0:07:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:07:07):**  I think it's the connection to nature.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:07:09):**  We connect towards nature and imagine what is or what has been there.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:07:15):**  And that is such intrinsic value for each and every person.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:07:20):**  Everybody resonates with that.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:07:21):**  So I think we are carrying that energy with us.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:07:25):**  So when we are talking to a group or to a person, we light up, you could say.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:07:30):**  So I think that energy really, really helps.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:07:33):**  We did also create a green Sinai by using computers and drawings, etc.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:07:39):**  So we visualize it actually to share with people as well.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:07:44):**  But we don't need it for people to actually connect to it.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:07:48):**  Just a short talk of three minutes most of the time is enough for people to be triggered  
**[0:07:53-0:07:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:07:53):**  enough to bring their values.  
**[0:07:55-0:08:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:07:55):**  So let's because this is much bigger and that's why I'm very interested in it then just just  
**[0:08:00-0:08:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:08:00):**  between brackets, a simple regeneration project that we see very often, like we do some waterworks,  
**[0:08:05-0:08:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:08:05):**  we restore some vegetation.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:08:08):**  This is and that's in your name, the weather makers.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:08:10):**  This is a scheme to influence the local weather patterns.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:08:13):**  Was that there from the beginning that the ambitious was so high that you actually want  
**[0:08:17-0:08:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:08:17):**  to influence quite a large weather system.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:08:19):**  It's part of the Mediterranean.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:08:21):**  It's part of the other side as well.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:08:22):**  To see like this is not this is almost geoengineering with nature at its core.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:08:27):**  Was it part of the plan from the beginning or did it really start with, OK, let's see  
**[0:08:30-0:08:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:08:30):**  if we can restore this lake.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:08:32):**  And then suddenly you found out like, wow, this is part of such big system and we can  
**[0:08:36-0:08:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:08:36):**  influence that as well.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:08:37):**  Well, the initial question was about the lake.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:08:39):**  But at that time it was still with the dredging company.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:08:42):**  For them, it was regenerating the lake.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:08:45):**  Just for people, what is a dredging company?  
**[0:08:47-0:08:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:08:47):**  If you have no idea, if you have to describe it in what to do a child, how would you describe  
**[0:08:53-0:08:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:08:53):**  a dredging company?  
**[0:08:54-0:08:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:08:54):**  Well, dredging is one of the biggest industries we have.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:08:59):**  It's deepening canals.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:09:01):**  It's creating ports.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:09:02):**  It's deep sea mining.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:09:04):**  It's also they're a big part of placing windmills in the oceans.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:09:09):**  Underwater infrastructure.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:09:10):**  Well, it's being able to scrape away the bottom of the ocean to create infrastructure there.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:09:16):**  So if it's rock or is it mud or it doesn't matter, they can they can take it out.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:09:23):**  It's quite an intensive, I would say, negative footprint or extractive industry.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:09:29):**  Even if you do it with the best intentions, it's quite an industry with a lot of impact.  
**[0:09:33-0:09:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:09:33):**  Well, very much related also to the oil industry and in infrastructure, of course, we need  
**[0:09:38-0:09:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:09:38):**  it.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:09:39):**  And it also created land, as we know, in the Netherlands.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:09:42):**  So the Netherlands is created by placing sand at spots, which also the dredging industry  
**[0:09:48-0:09:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:09:48):**  will do.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:09:49):**  But yes, it has a very negative footprint, you could say.  
**[0:09:53-0:09:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:09:53):**  But they have the potential to have huge impact.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:09:57):**  They can change the Earth's view that you can actually view from satellites.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:10:02):**  So you could use that kind of potential to do good.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:10:06):**  So that's why we have a large scale impact.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:10:09):**  And we dream large scale.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:10:11):**  And so it was first the lake.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:10:14):**  And then how did it become influencing a weather system?  
**[0:10:18-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:10:18):**  Well, it started with the lake, and then it was still comprehensive enough for the dredging  
**[0:10:22-0:10:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:10:22):**  company to keep it within their scope.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:10:25):**  At the moment that we started to think, hey, we can change the winds, we can actually heal  
**[0:10:30-0:10:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:10:30):**  the water cycle for the full northern part of the Sinai.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:10:33):**  And that will influence the wind pattern.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:10:36):**  So in that sense, it will influence also the weather system of the Indian Ocean and the  
**[0:10:40-0:10:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:10:40):**  full of the Mediterranean.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:10:42):**  So it's not just the Sinai water cycle, but we're talking very much bigger than that.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:10:48):**  When that became part of our vision, that was the moment we needed to step away from  
**[0:10:52-0:10:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:10:52):**  the dredging company and do it ourselves.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:10:53):**  So that large impact is the reason that we founded the company.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:10:58):**  Without that, we would never have done it.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:11:00):**  And one of the first things we did when we started the company is create a conference  
**[0:11:06-0:11:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:11:06):**  with all the institutes of the Netherlands.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:11:08):**  We have a lot of smart people in the Netherlands regarding water, regarding weather systems  
**[0:11:13-0:11:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:11:13):**  like Canemie, Deltares, Wageningen.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:11:18):**  So we're very well placed in the world for water engineering, you could say.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:11:23):**  So the first thing we did was have a conference to have the question, can we not do this?  
**[0:11:30-0:11:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:11:30):**  So what is the reason we cannot?  
**[0:11:32-0:11:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:11:32):**  So that was the scientific question, like, please tackle us.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:11:36):**  Please let us know why this is an insane plan, why we cannot do this.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:11:41):**  And they were not able to do so.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:11:43):**  So then it was full force.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:11:45):**  And weren't they critical at all?  
**[0:11:47-0:11:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:11:47):**  Or were they just saying, you're crazy, but we don't have really good arguments?  
**[0:11:50-0:11:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:11:50):**  What was the response?  
**[0:11:51-0:11:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:11:51):**  Or please go ahead, somebody has to do this.  
**[0:11:53-0:11:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:11:53):**  What was the general, let's say, energy in the room or mix?  
**[0:11:57-0:12:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:11:57):**  Well, the energy was very positive, although there was also very critical.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:12:02):**  Can we do this?  
**[0:12:03-0:12:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:12:03):**  Are we allowed to do this?  
**[0:12:04-0:12:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:12:04):**  What will be the consequences?  
**[0:12:06-0:12:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:12:06):**  We don't know, so we shouldn't.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:12:08):**  That kind of energy was there.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:12:11):**  But also, we do know that we're in a hotspot together.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:12:15):**  And we do need to do something.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:12:17):**  And we're talking about a region where it's the political tension, the people are not  
**[0:12:22-0:12:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:12:22):**  able to take care of their own livelihood.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:12:25):**  So there's so much gain at that location, that it's also a vision that we, you know,  
**[0:12:31-0:12:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:12:31):**  even if it's 1% chance that we can do this, we should.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:12:35):**  And we were at that moment already very much assisted by what we call our Jedis.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:12:41):**  We have a group of scientists, biologists that have spent their whole life creating  
**[0:12:47-0:12:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:12:47):**  visions, creating solutions, creating data and theories at a high level that are now  
**[0:12:54-0:12:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:12:54):**  like 80 year olds that really assist us and stand with us.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:12:59):**  And they all came to the Netherlands also during that convention.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:13:02):**  So that gave it this, whoa, these people are actually telling us also that, you know, the  
**[0:13:08-0:13:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:13:08):**  weathermakers are correct in saying, let's do this.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:13:12):**  So it was a very hopeful gathering.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:13:15):**  And then what were the first steps after that?  
**[0:13:17-0:13:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:13:17):**  Like what, you come out of this conference energy that we all know, in this case, you  
**[0:13:21-0:13:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:13:21):**  organized it yourself.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:13:22):**  So maybe it was even higher, the energy people didn't shoot it down.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:13:26):**  When was this and then what was the next step?  
**[0:13:29-0:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:13:29):**  Well, this was November, 2017.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:13:32):**  And just so you know, we started April 1st, 2017.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:13:36):**  So at the time people said, what, you're going to do a conference in November?  
**[0:13:40-0:13:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:13:40):**  Are you crazy?  
**[0:13:41-0:13:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:13:41):**  And who are you hiring to do so?  
**[0:13:43-0:13:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:13:43):**  No, we're just, we'll do that.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:13:45):**  And, you know, we organized it in two months and everybody came and we had a location in  
**[0:13:50-0:13:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:13:50):**  the Raadszaal.  
**[0:13:52-0:13:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:13:52):**  So that's like of the municipality, like the beautiful room they have.  
**[0:13:56-0:13:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:13:56):**  And it was a two day.  
**[0:13:58-0:13:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:13:58):**  So we had everybody staying at hotels.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:13:59):**  And I don't know, there was this magical energy that we just, we organized and it was done.  
**[0:14:05-0:14:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:14:05):**  And we had the first night we had a dinner at the parents of Thys and they cooked themselves  
**[0:14:10-0:14:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:14:10):**  and it was amazing.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:14:11):**  And actually afterwards it was like, wow, did we actually do this?  
**[0:14:17-0:14:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:14:17):**  And there was no moment of doubt while creating.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:14:21):**  So we had very high energy coming out and there was nothing keeping us in moving forward.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:14:29):**  And I think it assisted a lot in getting it back on the agenda of the dredging company.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:14:35):**  Because as I said, when it started to be that big, we had to do it by ourselves.  
**[0:14:41-0:14:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:14:41):**  And they supported us a lot with creating work for us as engineers.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:14:46):**  So in that sense, they bring us the revenue that we need to stand.  
**[0:14:51-0:14:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:14:51):**  And of course, for us, it's how much of that energy can we bring to actually regenerative  
**[0:14:56-0:14:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:14:56):**  projects or to Bardeville and the Sinai.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:14:59):**  And at the moment of the convention, the interest of the dredging company started to be a little  
**[0:15:04-0:15:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:15:04):**  bit down.  
**[0:15:05-0:15:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:15:05):**  Like this is too big.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:15:07):**  How much are we going to invest in this actually?  
**[0:15:10-0:15:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:15:10):**  You know, maybe we need to leave it a little bit behind.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:15:12):**  And after the convention, they were like, whoa, did you see all these people that said  
**[0:15:17-0:15:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:15:17):**  that we can actually do this?  
**[0:15:18-0:15:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:15:18):**  So it assisted a lot in the belief within the dredging company and having their board  
**[0:15:24-0:15:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:15:24):**  also discussed this on high level and making the SDGs, but also the regenerative way, a  
**[0:15:32-0:15:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:15:32):**  very big part of their future focus, which of course is already like huge impact if they  
**[0:15:37-0:15:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:15:37):**  actually do that.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:15:39):**  Yeah, if that would be the only thing.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:15:42):**  But just to take one step back, you mentioned us as a company a few times, you very deliberately  
**[0:15:47-0:15:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:15:47):**  set up a company and not a non for profit.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:15:50):**  I think many investors in the room saying the virtual room will be very happy to hear  
**[0:15:55-0:15:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:15:55):**  that.  
**[0:15:56-0:15:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:15:56):**  But can you explain why you chose to do that?  
**[0:15:58-0:15:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:15:58):**  Very deliberately?  
**[0:15:59-0:16:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:15:59):**  If you're an NGO, you have to ask for money.  
**[0:16:03-0:16:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:16:03):**  And it doesn't go well with me, my energy goes down, my light tends to slimmer down  
**[0:16:08-0:16:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:16:08):**  and I need to send in my light if I want to have this happen together with all of us.  
**[0:16:14-0:16:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:16:14):**  So for me, it's already that.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:16:17):**  It's already taking care of yourself part.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:16:20):**  But what is very important is we believe that this will be the biggest industry out there.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:16:26):**  So it will be bigger than regenerative energy, if you would ask me.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:16:30):**  And we can't do that with one company.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:16:32):**  And we can't do that with giving money.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:16:34):**  We need to have people copy paste us and start being part of this.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:16:40):**  And we can only do that if we show that you can make money with it.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:16:43):**  So we need to show that we can take care of our own families, have a healthy business  
**[0:16:48-0:16:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:16:48):**  with a healthy business opportunity so that others will join and make it happen.  
**[0:16:55-0:17:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:16:55):**  And so what is the business model currently in the project in the CNI?  
**[0:17:01-0:17:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:17:01):**  I mean, there's a huge dredging part that needs to happen.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:17:03):**  There are a lot of other moving parts.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:17:05):**  How would you describe to an investor the business opportunity there, apart from that  
**[0:17:09-0:17:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:17:09):**  regreening the desert and influencing weather systems is a very significant goal to you  
**[0:17:15-0:17:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:17:15):**  and very significant outcome, obviously.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:17:17):**  But what is the business opportunity if you have your meeting with investors as you regularly  
**[0:17:22-0:17:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:17:22):**  have?  
**[0:17:23-0:17:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:17:23):**  Well, how do you describe that unique opportunity and the why now, which people always like  
**[0:17:27-0:17:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:17:27):**  to know?  
**[0:17:28-0:17:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:17:28):**  Well, A, I think it's important to add that at this moment, we don't have external investors.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:17:34):**  So as you mentioned, when you talk to your investors, we tend to tell ourselves, let's  
**[0:17:40-0:17:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:17:40):**  imagine we are having investors because we do need to have that focus to show that we  
**[0:17:46-0:17:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:17:46):**  are worthwhile.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:17:47):**  So when you are talking to not your investors yet, but potential investors, what do you  
**[0:17:51-0:17:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:17:51):**  say?  
**[0:17:52-0:17:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:17:52):**  Well, I think that's very important to potential investors.  
**[0:17:55-0:18:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:17:55):**  Yes, I think A, it's very important to split up the project in phases and then each track  
**[0:18:01-0:18:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:18:01):**  even in more phases, because there are many different complex systems that we need to  
**[0:18:06-0:18:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:18:06):**  use and they will not all have the same kind of business scheme or opportunity.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:18:15):**  Phase one, track one is regenerating the coastal zone.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:18:19):**  And I think that's also the one that is most intertwined with the dredging company.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:18:25):**  And also it's like it's in the sense of it's an infrastructural project and we're used  
**[0:18:31-0:18:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:18:31):**  to talk about millions if we talk about infrastructural projects.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:18:35):**  So that really assists.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:18:36):**  Probably hundreds of millions.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:18:37):**  Yes, no problem.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:18:39):**  That's like still a small project.  
**[0:18:41-0:18:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:18:41):**  So that really helps in this sense.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:18:45):**  How is the business case at this moment set?  
**[0:18:47-0:18:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:18:47):**  If you look at the quality of the aquatic systems and fish stocks out there, we are  
**[0:18:53-0:18:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:18:53):**  having a problem.  
**[0:18:55-0:18:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:18:55):**  It's almost like don't eat fish because there's not enough out there.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:18:59):**  But if you look at regenerative time schedules, your aquatic system regenerates much quicker  
**[0:19:06-0:19:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:19:06):**  than your land system.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:19:08):**  So we should first have our attention on the coastal zone, create more fish stocks so that  
**[0:19:13-0:19:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:19:13):**  people can eat from it, have livelihood about it and then move forward.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:19:19):**  And the investment of the lake will be earned back by the government via the VAT out of  
**[0:19:26-0:19:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:19:26):**  the economy that is created with the fish stock.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:19:30):**  So we're really talking about a fish engine within the lake and creating an abundant system  
**[0:19:36-0:19:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:19:36):**  of which people can eat, have export economy, pay taxes.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:19:41):**  And that's the first step to restore the fish stocks, to restore the lake that it can carry  
**[0:19:46-0:19:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:19:46):**  an abundance of fish.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:19:48):**  And in this case, you mentioned the return model is through simple or simple, it's not  
**[0:19:53-0:19:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:19:53):**  simple, but increased economic activity and does VAT.  
**[0:19:57-0:20:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:19:57):**  And so you're envisioning that the Egyptian government will pay for this and see it as  
**[0:20:02-0:20:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:20:02):**  an investment in regional development as they do all the time in many other places.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:20:07):**  Could be sewage systems, could be roads, could be anything.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:20:11):**  Would it already be enough to start to like, let's get a bit into the fish system.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:20:15):**  Would that be enough to start restoring a significant amount of vegetation also around  
**[0:20:20-0:20:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:20:20):**  the lake?  
**[0:20:21-0:20:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:20:21):**  Is that the first trigger there?  
**[0:20:23-0:20:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:20:23):**  Definitely.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:20:24):**  You need wetlands, you need mudslides, you need that part to have an abundant aquatic  
**[0:20:30-0:20:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:20:30):**  system.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:20:31):**  So that's all part.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:20:32):**  And I think you're right, it is a simple business case, you could say.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:20:37):**  The only thing is you need someone to own the land and the VAT system around it, which  
**[0:20:42-0:20:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:20:42):**  makes it complex because you need to have a go ahead on very high level in a political  
**[0:20:48-0:20:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:20:48):**  sense.  
**[0:20:49-0:20:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:20:49):**  So that is, you have a long road.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:20:51):**  It's not like you have one person saying, Hey, I've got a plot of land, let's do this.  
**[0:20:55-0:20:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:20:55):**  Let's go.  
**[0:20:56-0:20:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:20:56):**  So that makes it complex.  
**[0:20:57-0:20:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:20:57):**  Yeah.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:20:58):**  You need to convince the right parts of the Egyptian government all the way up to the  
**[0:21:02-0:21:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:21:02):**  top that this is all the way up to the top.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:21:05):**  Yes.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:21:06):**  That this is very doable and looking very good for him or for them whenever this is  
**[0:21:12-0:21:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:21:12):**  successful and not a risk that could taint any political careers, etc, etc.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:21:16):**  Of course, you get into a lot of political interesting discussions.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:21:19):**  Well, you know, we're talking business case, we most of the time only talk about money,  
**[0:21:24-0:21:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:21:24):**  like first grade money.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:21:26):**  So that's why I'm saying the VAT and the fish.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:21:29):**  But actually, as a government, of course, they have a huge problem that it's a location  
**[0:21:36-0:21:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:21:36):**  where there's a lot of disputes, an unsafe location, not always easy for them to go to  
**[0:21:42-0:21:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:21:42):**  terrorist activities.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:21:45):**  And they want to have it part of Egypt, but it's the Sinai.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:21:48):**  So you know, there tends to be sometimes a little bit of discussion.  
**[0:21:52-0:22:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:21:52):**  So just creating a balanced situation is already of a huge value to the government.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:22:01):**  But we cannot easily say that value is, you know, accumulated towards this and this amount.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:22:08):**  And of course, the same goes for if you have a system where people can take care of themselves,  
**[0:22:14-0:22:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:22:14):**  they won't run off to Europe to have a life for their children and themselves.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:22:20):**  So also, there is a lot of value.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:22:23):**  So the value I think the value added will be enormous, but it's very different when  
**[0:22:31-0:22:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:22:31):**  you calculate because we like calculation.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:22:33):**  So we you know, we tend to say like, oh, it's a very beneficial project.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:22:39):**  But when you mention that kind of amount, people tend to say, oh, that's too much.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:22:45):**  So it takes away all the credibility.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:22:50):**  And it's far fetched for people because they tend to say, oh, but I'm too little a person  
**[0:22:55-0:22:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:22:55):**  to have such big impacts.  
**[0:22:57-0:23:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:22:57):**  And the weathermakers is a too small a company to have that kind of impact.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:23:02):**  But we actually believe that as humanity, that's why we are also called the weathermakers,  
**[0:23:07-0:23:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:23:07):**  because everybody can call themselves a weathermaker.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:23:10):**  Because as humanity, we have always been already weathermakers.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:23:14):**  We actually can create such big impact if we want to take care of ourselves and be part  
**[0:23:20-0:23:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:23:20):**  of nature.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:23:21):**  But it's a system change.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:23:24):**  It's a huge switch.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:23:26):**  And for the current the first phase, I imagine the right people say yes, tomorrow, how long  
**[0:23:31-0:23:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:23:31):**  do you envision that first phase to take before you can start saying or speaking about abundance  
**[0:23:37-0:23:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:23:37):**  of fish and abundance of life, let's say in the lake and around the lake?  
**[0:23:41-0:23:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:23:41):**  Is that months, years, generations?  
**[0:23:45-0:23:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:23:45):**  What is the timeline we're looking at here for this specific very large area?  
**[0:23:49-0:23:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:23:49):**  It's not just a small lake.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:23:51):**  It's not just for people to understand this is massive.  
**[0:23:53-0:23:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:23:53):**  But what are you seeing in terms of, let's say the money comes, the approval comes, probably  
**[0:23:58-0:24:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:23:58):**  the approval comes first, then the money.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:24:00):**  You start tomorrow, day after tomorrow, what are the timelines we're looking at before  
**[0:24:04-0:24:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:24:04):**  we see significant, significant impact, and maybe even before the weather starts adapting  
**[0:24:09-0:24:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:24:09):**  to it or starts being influenced and being made, quote unquote.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:24:13):**  For the weather, we need three tracks.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:24:15):**  So we're talking now about phase one, track one.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:24:17):**  So the weather will come later.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:24:19):**  That impact is a longer term.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:24:21):**  However, the aquatic system, when you start dredging, as I said, you know, they can do  
**[0:24:25-0:24:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:24:25):**  huge amounts in very short time.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:24:28):**  So our biggest challenge is going to be the management systems to have them have a clear  
**[0:24:33-0:24:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:24:33):**  view on the impact they're having while dredging, because they have a different outcome request  
**[0:24:40-0:24:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:24:40):**  now.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:24:41):**  Normally, yeah.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:24:42):**  Normally, it's like dig as much as possible.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:24:44):**  So they need to dredge the lake.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:24:46):**  So they need to make the lake a lot deeper and all that sediment from like two or four  
**[0:24:49-0:24:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:24:49):**  meters, but it goes down a lot more that sediment.  
**[0:24:52-0:24:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:24:52):**  In this case, you need it and you need it probably in a certain state.  
**[0:24:56-0:25:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:24:56):**  So what is so different from a normal assignment they do when they have to dredge a port and  
**[0:25:00-0:25:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:25:00):**  make it deeper or have to do some work like that?  
**[0:25:03-0:25:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:25:03):**  What is the challenge for them?  
**[0:25:05-0:25:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:25:05):**  Let's start first with your previous question, because I need to answer that first.  
**[0:25:10-0:25:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:25:10):**  The first results you're already going to see in like three months time.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:25:15):**  So that's really quick.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:25:16):**  At this moment, there are like 2000 families living from the lake, and it used to be way  
**[0:25:21-0:25:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:25:21):**  more.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:25:22):**  Everybody living around the lake used to live from the lake, but there's not enough there  
**[0:25:26-0:25:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:25:26):**  yet.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:25:27):**  So for those first families, those first three months is going to be huge impact because  
**[0:25:32-0:25:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:25:32):**  they're going to have enough food on their tables and they're going to have all that  
**[0:25:36-0:25:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:25:36):**  hope coming.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:25:37):**  And, you know, that's enormous already.  
**[0:25:40-0:25:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:25:40):**  That impact is done because you dredge inlets towards the ocean.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:25:44):**  So it's not deepening the lake yet.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:25:46):**  It's creating flushing of fresh water from the ocean, which is less saline, cooler, and  
**[0:25:54-0:25:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:25:54):**  you create more oxygen, so you create more life in the lake itself.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:25:58):**  So that's part one.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:26:01):**  And that's going to have a huge impact in a very short time.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:26:05):**  If you're talking about the full lake, we think it's going to take us five years.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:26:10):**  And as you said, yes, you're going to use what you dredge and use that to create the  
**[0:26:15-0:26:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:26:15):**  wetlands surrounding the lake.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:26:17):**  So you're going to create nature there where juvenile fish and all the trophic levels of  
**[0:26:23-0:26:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:26:23):**  life can start to regenerate and also plants, you know, plants, trees and have their root  
**[0:26:29-0:26:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:26:29):**  systems revive those soils.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:26:33):**  And that's going to have a huge impact.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:26:35):**  And that's a timeline which is sensible for everybody straight away.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:26:40):**  And it will get to that abundant point in those five years time.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:26:45):**  And it continues after, obviously, but it's going to hit like a significant tipping point  
**[0:26:50-0:26:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:26:50):**  in abundance relatively quickly.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:26:52):**  Like five years is not a lot.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:26:54):**  It's a lot, but it's not a lot at the same time.  
**[0:26:56-0:26:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:26:56):**  Well, and of course, the Egyptian government wants us to do the three years.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:26:58):**  So let's see, you know, how much time we take for it.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:27:01):**  But yes, the lake is going to regenerate very quickly.  
**[0:27:04-0:27:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:27:04):**  Is it possible to do it faster?  
**[0:27:06-0:27:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:27:06):**  Or is this timeline really based on, let's say, growth curves in nature?  
**[0:27:12-0:27:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:27:12):**  Like you cannot pull a piece of grass, it's not going to grow faster because of that,  
**[0:27:15-0:27:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:27:15):**  or a tree or make fish grow faster?  
**[0:27:17-0:27:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:27:17):**  Or is this also limited by resources and things like that?  
**[0:27:21-0:27:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:27:21):**  Well, it actually links also to the question that you already asked when I didn't answer  
**[0:27:26-0:27:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:27:26):**  the other one yet.  
**[0:27:27-0:27:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:27:27):**  If you have a normal dredging project, it's like how much cubic meter of substance you  
**[0:27:33-0:27:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:27:33):**  can dredge within a day?  
**[0:27:36-0:27:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:27:36):**  And just let go.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:27:38):**  And now you really have to look at yes, but if you go slower, you keep more intact, then  
**[0:27:43-0:27:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:27:43):**  you have less, you know, it's a settlement, it needs to have time.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:27:47):**  You don't want to over stir the whole system, which will have negative impact on the fish,  
**[0:27:53-0:27:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:27:53):**  etc, etc.  
**[0:27:54-0:28:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:27:54):**  So you need to take more time to do the work that could be done faster.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:28:01):**  And the game is going to be with monitoring also, like where can we move faster?  
**[0:28:07-0:28:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:28:07):**  And what time do we need?  
**[0:28:10-0:28:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:28:10):**  We will learn while doing.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:28:12):**  And it mainly depends on also the waves, the currents, tidal energy.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:28:18):**  So the most important thing is to have the people that are doing their work have all  
**[0:28:23-0:28:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:28:23):**  these different data inputs, so that they can have easy access towards decision making.  
**[0:28:30-0:28:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:28:30):**  Can I move forward?  
**[0:28:31-0:28:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:28:31):**  Do I need to go slower?  
**[0:28:32-0:28:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:28:32):**  Can I go faster?  
**[0:28:33-0:28:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:28:33):**  So that will actually optimize the productivity and also the timeline of the project and the  
**[0:28:40-0:28:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:28:40):**  outcome.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:28:41):**  So you're building like, on technology wise, like these monitoring, measuring and management  
**[0:28:47-0:28:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:28:47):**  systems to work with the dredging company because you're not dredging yourself, but  
**[0:28:51-0:28:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:28:51):**  to make sure that the outcome is the best possible and still at the least possible time,  
**[0:28:57-0:28:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:28:57):**  because you have the attention there, obviously.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:28:59):**  Is that where you spend a lot of the time of the company on?  
**[0:29:02-0:29:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:29:02):**  It's a very important part, definitely.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:29:04):**  And I think in the long term, it will be one of our main passes.  
**[0:29:08-0:29:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:29:08):**  So at this moment, we put a lot of time and effort in engineering design itself.  
**[0:29:14-0:29:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:29:14):**  What is needed?  
**[0:29:15-0:29:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:29:15):**  How much is needed?  
**[0:29:16-0:29:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:29:16):**  What are the volumes?  
**[0:29:17-0:29:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:29:17):**  What kind of regenerative aquatic ecosystems do we need?  
**[0:29:22-0:29:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:29:22):**  What are the habitats, etc.  
**[0:29:24-0:29:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:29:24):**  So there's a lot of energy going in that part and also in the development of new technologies  
**[0:29:28-0:29:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:29:28):**  that we need to transfer the aquatic towards the land system.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:29:32):**  But in the long term, I see for us as a strategy and also for creating the impact that we need  
**[0:29:38-0:29:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:29:38):**  the actual management systems to have every party within this complex transferal of energy,  
**[0:29:47-0:29:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:29:47):**  have the data available to make their own decisions.  
**[0:29:49-0:29:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:29:49):**  So yes, I think that is our main goal to create that and also to put that in a contractual  
**[0:29:56-0:30:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:29:56):**  setting so that we can also have KPIs on top of that and understand if we actually hit  
**[0:30:04-0:30:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:30:04):**  our goals and have value systems connected to that.  
**[0:30:08-0:30:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:30:08):**  And what is still missing there?  
**[0:30:11-0:30:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:30:11):**  I mean, apart from that, that overview is probably not there, etc.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:30:13):**  But is there are there pieces of technology you would love to have or systems you would  
**[0:30:19-0:30:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:30:19):**  love to have?  
**[0:30:20-0:30:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:30:20):**  Like if that would exist, that would be amazing.  
**[0:30:22-0:30:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:30:22):**  Certain sensors, monitoring or completely different decentralized autonomous organizations.  
**[0:30:28-0:30:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:30:28):**  Like what if you had a wishlist, what would be on top to be able to get off the shelf  
**[0:30:32-0:30:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:30:32):**  tomorrow and use?  
**[0:30:34-0:30:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:30:34):**  My wishlist is actually to create the minimum viable products.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:30:39):**  So I need a location to do so.  
**[0:30:41-0:30:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:30:41):**  I have the team ready.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:30:42):**  We have the competences in house.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:30:44):**  We know in which language we want to create it.  
**[0:30:47-0:30:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:30:47):**  We want to create a digital twin of the of the environmental data of the earth.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:30:51):**  We know how to do so.  
**[0:30:53-0:30:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:30:53):**  But we need time and investment to do it and a location to trial it on.  
**[0:30:59-0:31:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:30:59):**  So I would say a coastal zone.  
**[0:31:02-0:31:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:31:02):**  And how many other areas like the project you're working on now are there?  
**[0:31:07-0:31:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:31:07):**  Like let's say this doesn't happen or doesn't happen anytime soon or does happen and the  
**[0:31:12-0:31:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:31:12):**  company is looking, OK, what's next?  
**[0:31:14-0:31:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:31:14):**  Are there many other coastal zones with lakes like that or many other places where you could  
**[0:31:19-0:31:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:31:19):**  apply this at this scale and have weather impact?  
**[0:31:21-0:31:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:31:21):**  Have you looked at that?  
**[0:31:22-0:31:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:31:22):**  I can't imagine you didn't.  
**[0:31:24-0:31:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:31:24):**  But what's the zone beyond this specific project?  
**[0:31:28-0:31:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:31:28):**  How many other projects could you be working on?  
**[0:31:30-0:31:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:31:30):**  I think there is a there's a divide in the question for me.  
**[0:31:34-0:31:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:31:34):**  We have the goal to have watershed wide impact and a watershed definitely if you look in  
**[0:31:42-0:31:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:31:42):**  the Netherlands, for instance, when are we hitting a mountain range two thousand meter  
**[0:31:47-0:31:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:31:47):**  high?  
**[0:31:48-0:31:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:31:48):**  That's pretty far away from us as a coastal zone.  
**[0:31:51-0:31:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:31:51):**  It's the Alps basically.  
**[0:31:53-0:31:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:31:53):**  And sometimes it's a very widespread area.  
**[0:31:56-0:32:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:31:56):**  I mean, you could say that as a Dutch, we are part of the Brazilian watershed.  
**[0:32:00-0:32:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:32:00):**  I mean, there's just ocean between us.  
**[0:32:02-0:32:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:32:02):**  So then it's such a huge area that it's almost impossible to get to that point immediately  
**[0:32:10-0:32:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:32:10):**  or to have a project in sync to have that done.  
**[0:32:14-0:32:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:32:14):**  The Sinai is, I think, the most perfect, beautiful small watershed out there to do this.  
**[0:32:21-0:32:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:32:21):**  So if you look at our actual goal, watershed wide ecosystem regeneration, the Sinai is  
**[0:32:26-0:32:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:32:26):**  the ideal location.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:32:27):**  However, there are very many small watersheds available.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:32:34):**  So coastline with a mountain top not that far away.  
**[0:32:38-0:32:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:32:38):**  And it could be that it's just a very small wadi, but each and every wadi would be fantastic  
**[0:32:44-0:32:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:32:44):**  to do this.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:32:45):**  So the world is our stage, you could say.  
**[0:32:47-0:32:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:32:47):**  So there's a lot of possibility to have projects.  
**[0:32:51-0:32:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:32:51):**  And we're not only talking about coastal zones, we're also talking about rivers, lakes and  
**[0:32:56-0:32:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:32:56):**  having them be abundant again.  
**[0:32:59-0:33:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:32:59):**  And in the rivers, in the Netherlands, for instance, we talk a lot about pollution because  
**[0:33:04-0:33:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:33:04):**  of too high level of nutrients.  
**[0:33:08-0:33:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:33:08):**  But nutrients are not a pollutant.  
**[0:33:11-0:33:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:33:11):**  They're just in an imbalanced state within the water system.  
**[0:33:16-0:33:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:33:16):**  And life, living biomass, can actually balance that out.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:33:21):**  So it's not only salt, it's also freshwater systems.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:33:26):**  So where there's water, we can do stuff, we can do our work, or we can, you know, have  
**[0:33:33-0:33:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:33:33):**  other people be intrigued and bring their energy.  
**[0:33:38-0:33:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:33:38):**  And because you very specifically mentioned we would love others to do this as well.  
**[0:33:43-0:33:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:33:43):**  We love competitors, competition.  
**[0:33:45-0:33:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:33:45):**  Let's imagine we're listening or there's a group of investors listening to this.  
**[0:33:49-0:33:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:33:49):**  What would you tell them if they are getting interested and they should in, let's say,  
**[0:33:54-0:33:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:33:54):**  the water cycle restoration or regeneration?  
**[0:33:56-0:33:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:33:56):**  Let's not just focus on soil.  
**[0:33:58-0:34:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:33:58):**  The water cycle is what drives it.  
**[0:34:00-0:34:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:34:00):**  Where would you point them?  
**[0:34:01-0:34:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:34:01):**  What would you tell them?  
**[0:34:02-0:34:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:34:02):**  Obviously without giving investment advice, but what would you tell them if they're getting  
**[0:34:06-0:34:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:34:06):**  excited about this to start investigating, to start talking, to diving deep into it?  
**[0:34:11-0:34:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:34:11):**  Because there are not so many, let's say, holistic engineers like yourself.  
**[0:34:14-0:34:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:34:14):**  What would be your advice to a room full of investors that are getting interested in their  
**[0:34:18-0:34:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:34:18):**  areas, their zones in this water cycle regeneration theme?  
**[0:34:22-0:34:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:34:22):**  Well, the biggest obstacle here is that we don't have a project yet to place the money.  
**[0:34:28-0:34:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:34:28):**  And a lot of investors are interested in placing their money in projects.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:34:32):**  And not only investors, but also United Nations, the World Bank, European Commission, et cetera,  
**[0:34:37-0:34:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:34:37):**  et cetera.  
**[0:34:38-0:34:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:34:38):**  They all have these pots of gold, you could say.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:34:41):**  And they have them ready to place in regenerative projects, but they don't have any projects  
**[0:34:46-0:34:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:34:46):**  to put it in.  
**[0:34:48-0:34:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:34:48):**  Or not sustainable projects, because it's projects that will need money forever and  
**[0:34:52-0:34:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:34:52):**  are actually depleting the aquifers at those locations.  
**[0:34:56-0:35:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:34:56):**  So we're talking about creating projects that have a sustainable future in the sense that  
**[0:35:03-0:35:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:35:03):**  you need to invest in it, but after a while the system will keep itself in balance.  
**[0:35:09-0:35:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:35:09):**  So then it is a system where services could come out.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:35:14):**  So it's a very good investment if you look at the hedge against system crash that we're  
**[0:35:18-0:35:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:35:18):**  talking about these days.  
**[0:35:20-0:35:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:35:20):**  But we first need those projects.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:35:22):**  And to get there, we have the issue that because we are working from intrinsic value, we're  
**[0:35:28-0:35:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:35:28):**  creating consultancy work so that we can pay our livelihood while investing all our other  
**[0:35:35-0:35:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:35:35):**  hours in creating solutions to get this done.  
**[0:35:39-0:35:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:35:39):**  But if we keep on doing it with our own revenue, which we've done for four years already, so  
**[0:35:44-0:35:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:35:44):**  I'm actually very proud of that.  
**[0:35:46-0:35:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:35:46):**  And we're now a team of 11.  
**[0:35:48-0:35:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:35:48):**  But it takes a long time if we keep doing it like that.  
**[0:35:51-0:35:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:35:51):**  And I would say after four years, we showed that we are a viable company.  
**[0:35:56-0:36:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:35:56):**  And we need, let's say, two and a half million to get the stress out of the money system  
**[0:36:02-0:36:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:36:02):**  and get all the energy and inspiration into the development.  
**[0:36:06-0:36:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:36:06):**  And then we'll have those projects.  
**[0:36:08-0:36:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:36:08):**  Well, all those billions and millions can flow into and regenerate our earth because  
**[0:36:14-0:36:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:36:14):**  we're creating systems that can be copy-paste wherever we want to do it open source.  
**[0:36:18-0:36:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:36:18):**  We're very keen on that also, because as an opt-in, of course, we want to have all the  
**[0:36:22-0:36:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:36:22):**  data and that will make us smarter and make us more effective and make us able to calibrate  
**[0:36:28-0:36:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:36:28):**  all our solutions towards even more efficient settings.  
**[0:36:33-0:36:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:36:33):**  So you're saying at the moment we are a bit distracted because of the consultancy work  
**[0:36:38-0:36:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:36:38):**  we have to do to keep the company going.  
**[0:36:40-0:36:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:36:40):**  But yeah, which means we're not focusing all of our time and energy and resources and  
**[0:36:45-0:36:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:36:45):**  vision into these projects that we would love to do, which is many, I think, consultants  
**[0:36:49-0:36:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:36:49):**  that also are building projects and products have that constant tension.  
**[0:36:54-0:37:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:36:54):**  So that's something that needs to be resolved in order for you to be able to focus fully  
**[0:37:01-0:37:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:37:01):**  on these kinds of projects.  
**[0:37:02-0:37:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:37:02):**  Would also projects be interesting in a sense that if somebody comes, yeah, but I have an  
**[0:37:06-0:37:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:37:06):**  aquatic system.  
**[0:37:07-0:37:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:37:07):**  I have I'm in control partly of a watershed, partly of enough land to potentially have  
**[0:37:13-0:37:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:37:13):**  an impact in Australia in somewhere else where, let's say, the water system and the mountains  
**[0:37:18-0:37:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:37:18):**  and the watershed is slightly smaller, maybe than the one we're describing in the Netherlands.  
**[0:37:22-0:37:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:37:22):**  You're obviously interested as an engineer and as a you're also interested in projects  
**[0:37:27-0:37:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:37:27):**  and working on them.  
**[0:37:29-0:37:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:37:29):**  So that might be another route to apply it on a much smaller scale, but you still will  
**[0:37:32-0:37:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:37:32):**  influence the weather.  
**[0:37:34-0:37:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:37:34):**  And if there's one landowner, it tends to go a bit faster if he or she is on board,  
**[0:37:38-0:37:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:37:38):**  I'm imagining.  
**[0:37:39-0:37:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:37:39):**  Definitely.  
**[0:37:41-0:37:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:37:41):**  And I think just to add to your comment, what have we done in these four, four and a half  
**[0:37:46-0:37:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:37:46):**  years is most of the projects that we did were projects that assisted us in building  
**[0:37:52-0:37:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:37:52):**  up our competencies and our team to be able to do what we want to do.  
**[0:37:58-0:38:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:37:58):**  So we created workability tools for ships for the company, the dredging company, which  
**[0:38:04-0:38:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:38:04):**  improved their productivity with average five percent.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:38:07):**  Well, if you know how much these ships cost per day, then you know that that is a huge.  
**[0:38:13-0:38:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:38:13):**  Yeah, there was a good investment of them to have us build that.  
**[0:38:17-0:38:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:38:17):**  But that building of that system has a lot of competencies needed that we also need to  
**[0:38:24-0:38:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:38:24):**  build the system of steering them during dredging of ecology work.  
**[0:38:30-0:38:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:38:30):**  So in all these kind of projects, I think 80 percent of our time was actually spent  
**[0:38:34-0:38:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:38:34):**  in projects that assisted us in the build of.  
**[0:38:38-0:38:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:38:38):**  But we're now at that moment that I say, like, we're really ready for the track one.  
**[0:38:43-0:38:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:38:43):**  So the regeneration of the coastal zone, we're ready.  
**[0:38:47-0:38:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:38:47):**  And we needed this four and a half years to really start shimmering where we needed and  
**[0:38:52-0:38:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:38:52):**  shining and being able to do so.  
**[0:38:55-0:38:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:38:55):**  We're ready.  
**[0:38:56-0:39:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:38:56):**  We're now investing much of our time in a solution of having the aquatic system go to  
**[0:39:01-0:39:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:39:01):**  the land system.  
**[0:39:03-0:39:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:39:03):**  And if we have a project which is large scale, then a small pilot to also assist that part  
**[0:39:08-0:39:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:39:08):**  will be very tangible or credible.  
**[0:39:12-0:39:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:39:12):**  Just what is that connection between the aquatic and the land system?  
**[0:39:15-0:39:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:39:15):**  We're going to get technical, but I'm very curious.  
**[0:39:17-0:39:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:39:17):**  Just describe it visually, because we're obviously in audio.  
**[0:39:21-0:39:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:39:21):**  And how does that system, what are you building there?  
**[0:39:23-0:39:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:39:23):**  What do you mention there, basically, for us newbies to understand?  
**[0:39:27-0:39:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:39:27):**  Well, we need methods to reuse the sediments.  
**[0:39:30-0:39:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:39:30):**  And I'm talking about the sediments that once were part of an ecosystem, let's say a lush  
**[0:39:35-0:39:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:39:35):**  garden of Eden with everything there, with rivers flowing, with fishes going upstream  
**[0:39:41-0:39:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:39:41):**  and coming down and, you know, the whole setting.  
**[0:39:45-0:39:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:39:45):**  And that was used for agriculture, for, you know, we cut the trees and we sow plants and,  
**[0:39:54-0:39:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:39:54):**  you know, we have animals graze the land, et cetera.  
**[0:39:58-0:40:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:39:58):**  In the end, it was degraded enough to be flushed away with rain, eroded, and it came into the  
**[0:40:06-0:40:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:40:06):**  lake.  
**[0:40:07-0:40:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:40:07):**  As you said, the lake was much deeper.  
**[0:40:08-0:40:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:40:08):**  I mean, we're talking about tens of meters deeper, and now it's one and a half meters  
**[0:40:13-0:40:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:40:13):**  deep on average.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:40:14):**  So what is in that lake is that eroded sediment out of your lush system.  
**[0:40:19-0:40:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:40:19):**  So what we want to do is take that sediment with its indigenous seed memory, with its  
**[0:40:25-0:40:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:40:25):**  indigenous nutrients and everything that is needed for that specific location on the earth,  
**[0:40:31-0:40:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:40:31):**  because it is indigenous and you want to place it back.  
**[0:40:34-0:40:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:40:34):**  But it's saline today, so we need to desalinate those sediments.  
**[0:40:39-0:40:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:40:39):**  And we have a prototype on the construction to do so.  
**[0:40:41-0:40:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:40:41):**  Basically, what's interesting is that we talk a lot about soil erosion with water, obviously,  
**[0:40:46-0:40:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:40:46):**  in larger watershed systems where it usually goes down a river and then it ends up in sea  
**[0:40:51-0:40:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:40:51):**  and it's sort of lost.  
**[0:40:52-0:40:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:40:52):**  I mean, it depends because also there it needs to be dredged if the end of the river gets  
**[0:40:55-0:40:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:40:55):**  too shallow.  
**[0:40:57-0:40:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:40:57):**  But in this case, it's very close.  
**[0:40:58-0:40:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:40:58):**  Like it's in the lake.  
**[0:40:59-0:41:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:40:59):**  Like you could you could touch it and see it.  
**[0:41:01-0:41:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:41:01):**  And of course, it's saline, but there is a possibility to reactivate, to bring it back  
**[0:41:06-0:41:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:41:06):**  and to have all that seed memory, to have all that back because it's relatively close  
**[0:41:10-0:41:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:41:10):**  in terms of I think many other watershed systems cannot or it's very tricky to do it because  
**[0:41:16-0:41:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:41:16):**  it's runoff and it ends up in an ocean somewhere and it goes very deep.  
**[0:41:19-0:41:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:41:19):**  But in many other places where it's so shallow, maybe it is possible to with not too much  
**[0:41:24-0:41:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:41:24):**  energy to bring it back on shore and to use it again.  
**[0:41:28-0:41:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:41:28):**  So that's where there's prototype and work being done now.  
**[0:41:31-0:41:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:41:31):**  And it is also very important in a timeline because there is a natural line that is keeping  
**[0:41:38-0:41:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:41:38):**  the lagoon in place.  
**[0:41:39-0:41:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:41:39):**  So there's a land strip between the lake and the ocean, which makes it a lagoon.  
**[0:41:45-0:41:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:41:45):**  But that is constantly under attack of all the elements.  
**[0:41:51-0:41:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:41:51):**  So winds, ocean, weather, waves, tidal energy.  
**[0:41:56-0:41:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:41:56):**  And you see it already diminishing.  
**[0:41:58-0:42:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:41:58):**  So the moment that that breaks, then you lose that what we're talking about, because then  
**[0:42:03-0:42:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:42:03):**  it's flushed into the deeper parts of the ocean.  
**[0:42:06-0:42:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:42:06):**  So at this moment it's contained, but time is of the essence.  
**[0:42:12-0:42:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:42:12):**  And we're talking about that part being in place for, let's say, 10,000 years, probably  
**[0:42:17-0:42:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:42:17):**  longer because before that it was a very luscious lagoon.  
**[0:42:20-0:42:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:42:20):**  But it kept the eroded sediment in place for thousands of years.  
**[0:42:26-0:42:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:42:26):**  But if that breaks down and we're talking about not, I think within 20 years it could  
**[0:42:32-0:42:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:42:32):**  be very much quicker than that.  
**[0:42:34-0:42:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:42:34):**  But you see it already deteriorating as we speak.  
**[0:42:38-0:42:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:42:38):**  So there is a time limit on this solution, on this location.  
**[0:42:44-0:42:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:42:44):**  And then I like to ask this question, what would you do if you would be in charge of,  
**[0:42:48-0:42:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:42:48):**  let's say, a large investment fund?  
**[0:42:50-0:42:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:42:50):**  And of course you can invest in the weathermakers, but I am always asking this question because  
**[0:42:53-0:42:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:42:53):**  I like to understand priorities.  
**[0:42:56-0:43:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:42:56):**  What would people focus on if they had, I wouldn't say unlimited resources, but let's  
**[0:43:00-0:43:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:43:00):**  say a billion dollars.  
**[0:43:01-0:43:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:43:01):**  What would you, tomorrow morning, you're not, I mean, you are still the co-founder of the  
**[0:43:06-0:43:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:43:06):**  weathermakers, but you have now to put this money to work.  
**[0:43:09-0:43:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:43:09):**  With all the projects you've seen, all the possibilities you've seen, what would you  
**[0:43:12-0:43:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:43:12):**  do with a billion dollars and why?  
**[0:43:15-0:43:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:43:15):**  Regenerate the Sinai.  
**[0:43:16-0:43:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:43:16):**  Would that be enough?  
**[0:43:18-0:43:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:43:18):**  No, it's not enough, but it's a hell of a lot of money to kickstart it.  
**[0:43:24-0:43:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:43:24):**  And would it be enough to get the agreement, like is money the issue there?  
**[0:43:28-0:43:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:43:28):**  Or is it more political, not getting the right signatures and the right okays at the right  
**[0:43:33-0:43:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:43:33):**  places yet?  
**[0:43:34-0:43:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:43:34):**  Or would a billion dollars in your back pocket actually help to kickstart some things?  
**[0:43:38-0:43:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:43:38):**  I'm very happy that the negotiations is between the contractor, so the dredging company and  
**[0:43:44-0:43:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:43:44):**  the Egyptian government that we come after.  
**[0:43:48-0:43:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:43:48):**  But let's say the Egyptian government says they don't need other people's money for this.  
**[0:43:52-0:43:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:43:52):**  They say they can pay for it themselves.  
**[0:43:55-0:43:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:43:55):**  Definitely phase one.  
**[0:43:57-0:44:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:43:57):**  And I think that partly is political because then it's their project and there's no other  
**[0:44:02-0:44:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:44:02):**  influence within their region.  
**[0:44:05-0:44:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:44:05):**  But I think at the moment that we say, I mean, we have contact with them straight as well.  
**[0:44:11-0:44:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:44:11):**  If we would bring to the table to the whole consortium with the dredging company also,  
**[0:44:16-0:44:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:44:16):**  hey guys, we've got a billion dollars.  
**[0:44:19-0:44:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:44:19):**  First loss or something.  
**[0:44:20-0:44:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:44:20):**  Yeah.  
**[0:44:21-0:44:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:44:21):**  I mean, it depends on the conditions coming with that money.  
**[0:44:24-0:44:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:44:24):**  I mean, each and every euro comes with a condition most of the time.  
**[0:44:28-0:44:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:44:28):**  But no, if we have a billion to spend and it doesn't have to be returned in a very quick  
**[0:44:35-0:44:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:44:35):**  note.  
**[0:44:36-0:44:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:44:36):**  It could be, it's your, you're the investor.  
**[0:44:38-0:44:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:44:38):**  It could be 20 years, could be 30 years, 50 years, whatever you prefer.  
**[0:44:42-0:44:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:44:42):**  But it has to come back.  
**[0:44:43-0:44:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:44:43):**  Let's say it's investment money.  
**[0:44:44-0:44:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:44:44):**  It's not grand capital.  
**[0:44:45-0:44:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:44:45):**  But you're saying that could make a significant impact in, would you only spend it there or  
**[0:44:50-0:44:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:44:50):**  invest it there or would you also look at other projects to maybe prove in different  
**[0:44:53-0:44:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:44:53):**  contexts and locations to get more things going?  
**[0:44:56-0:45:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:44:56):**  Well, as I already said to you, Koen, this is the most perfect small watershed out there.  
**[0:45:02-0:45:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:45:02):**  So it has everything we need.  
**[0:45:04-0:45:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:45:04):**  But in not the ideal political place, we might say.  
**[0:45:08-0:45:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:45:08):**  It's not the easiest political sense.  
**[0:45:10-0:45:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:45:10):**  Yeah.  
**[0:45:11-0:45:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:45:11):**  No, but on the other hand, why is it not a political easy location?  
**[0:45:15-0:45:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:45:15):**  Probably connected to the degradation.  
**[0:45:17-0:45:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:45:17):**  Yeah.  
**[0:45:18-0:45:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:45:18):**  There's a lot of talk about what are the reasons to have war.  
**[0:45:21-0:45:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:45:21):**  I believe that water is a very important part of that.  
**[0:45:26-0:45:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:45:26):**  So also to show that impact.  
**[0:45:28-0:45:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:45:28):**  If it can be done there at the perfect place in not ideal circumstances.  
**[0:45:32-0:45:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:45:32):**  Yeah.  
**[0:45:33-0:45:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:45:33):**  So for me, so of course a billion, probably I would say, you know, there are some of the  
**[0:45:38-0:45:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:45:38):**  tracks or parts that we could pilot somewhere else to show, to learn.  
**[0:45:43-0:45:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:45:43):**  I mean, we're building a prototype in our back garden here in Nimbus.  
**[0:45:47-0:45:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:45:47):**  We don't have desert here, but it's very useful also here.  
**[0:45:51-0:45:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:45:51):**  We need to learn.  
**[0:45:52-0:45:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:45:52):**  So there would be a lot of, there would be part of the investment would go to prototypes  
**[0:45:56-0:46:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:45:56):**  and pilots a little bit more close by where we can visit and really feel the whole setting.  
**[0:46:02-0:46:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:46:02):**  But that's why I was saying I need two and a half million.  
**[0:46:04-0:46:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:46:04):**  I don't need a billion to do that.  
**[0:46:06-0:46:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:46:06):**  So the big money would go to the project Sinai, because also there we have the restoring of  
**[0:46:11-0:46:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:46:11):**  the water cycle as an academic research.  
**[0:46:14-0:46:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:46:14):**  So there's a PhD already going on that to have it scientifically proven what the impact  
**[0:46:21-0:46:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:46:21):**  of regreening is on your weather system.  
**[0:46:24-0:46:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:46:24):**  And you need that kind of proof to have the whole world adopt and then do the same in  
**[0:46:29-0:46:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:46:29):**  their region.  
**[0:46:30-0:46:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:46:30):**  So I would love for all the dredging ships to do the full coastline of the Northern Africa  
**[0:46:35-0:46:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:46:35):**  settings.  
**[0:46:36-0:46:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:46:36):**  I mean, there's so much to do there.  
**[0:46:39-0:46:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:46:39):**  So I could use all their additional productivity.  
**[0:46:43-0:46:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:46:43):**  So let's go.  
**[0:46:44-0:46:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:46:44):**  We have, because for me, billion is then not enough.  
**[0:46:47-0:46:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:46:47):**  So if there is no limit on spending, yes, we would do the full coastal zone of the Northern  
**[0:46:55-0:46:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:46:55):**  Africa zone.  
**[0:46:56-0:47:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:46:56):**  And probably there will be a lot of investors that want to do it in Spain because that's  
**[0:47:00-0:47:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:47:00):**  more Western and European.  
**[0:47:04-0:47:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:47:04):**  Easier to digest.  
**[0:47:05-0:47:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:47:05):**  Yeah.  
**[0:47:06-0:47:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:47:06):**  Yes.  
**[0:47:07-0:47:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:47:07):**  So yes, they're spending enough.  
**[0:47:09-0:47:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:47:09):**  And if you could change one thing overnight, so no longer in charge of the one billion,  
**[0:47:14-0:47:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:47:14):**  but you have a magic power, you have a magic wand that can change one thing overnight.  
**[0:47:18-0:47:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:47:18):**  Could be, I mean, people have given all kinds of answers to this question, global consciousness.  
**[0:47:22-0:47:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:47:22):**  I mean, we talk a lot about food and egg taste.  
**[0:47:25-0:47:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:47:25):**  It could be banning all chemical fertilizers and inputs, or it could be, I don't know,  
**[0:47:30-0:47:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:47:30):**  consciousness on the water cycle is the key.  
**[0:47:33-0:47:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:47:33):**  Anything you can imagine, but you have the power to change only one thing.  
**[0:47:36-0:47:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:47:36):**  What would that be?  
**[0:47:37-0:47:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:47:37):**  Awareness of the natural laws.  
**[0:47:39-0:47:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:47:39):**  You call them laws, not principles?  
**[0:47:41-0:47:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:47:41):**  Is it on purpose?  
**[0:47:43-0:47:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:47:43):**  I think they should be laws.  
**[0:47:45-0:47:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:47:45):**  Yeah.  
**[0:47:46-0:47:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:47:46):**  We shouldn't.  
**[0:47:47-0:47:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:47:47):**  For me, everything which is not a natural solution or not a natural answer will in the  
**[0:47:53-0:47:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:47:53):**  end create more problems.  
**[0:47:55-0:48:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:47:55):**  Which is interesting coming from engineers that are using these gigantic machines to  
**[0:48:00-0:48:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:48:00):**  do dredging.  
**[0:48:01-0:48:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:48:01):**  How do you combine that?  
**[0:48:03-0:48:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:48:03):**  How do you see dredging, which is taking pieces of the ocean floor or in this case, a lake  
**[0:48:07-0:48:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:48:07):**  floor, like very deep technology, very invasive technology?  
**[0:48:12-0:48:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:48:12):**  Is that part of nature's laws as dredging happens by nature as well?  
**[0:48:16-0:48:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:48:16):**  Or how do you explain that?  
**[0:48:19-0:48:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:48:19):**  It's using our industrial revolution or our solutions and our technology to large scale  
**[0:48:28-0:48:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:48:28):**  assist nature to get back to her strength and have her back in her light spot and do  
**[0:48:36-0:48:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:48:36):**  what she does best.  
**[0:48:37-0:48:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:48:37):**  So I mean, we mind the world.  
**[0:48:41-0:48:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:48:41):**  So let's mind properly.  
**[0:48:44-0:48:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:48:44):**  We broke a lot of systems and by just having awareness and meditation, we will not have  
**[0:48:51-0:48:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:48:51):**  it return to her natural strength in time.  
**[0:48:56-0:49:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:48:56):**  I mean, the earth will get back in strength in time, but not quick enough for us.  
**[0:49:01-0:49:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:49:01):**  And I think that as people, we have the instruments with our thumbs and our technical abilities  
**[0:49:07-0:49:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:49:07):**  and our data to assist, but I think we need to understand that we are serving and we're  
**[0:49:15-0:49:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:49:15):**  not demanding or controlling.  
**[0:49:20-0:49:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:49:20):**  So yes, I would love to use all technology in the world that is available to us today  
**[0:49:26-0:49:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:49:26):**  to get to that point.  
**[0:49:27-0:49:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:49:27):**  But always with the commons, it needs to bring us to a rebalanced system, which will be able  
**[0:49:37-0:49:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:49:37):**  to be run without those technologies.  
**[0:49:40-0:49:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:49:40):**  So there are time limits.  
**[0:49:42-0:49:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:49:42):**  So that's the condition.  
**[0:49:44-0:49:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:49:44):**  It's time limited self destruction.  
**[0:49:45-0:49:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:49:45):**  No, it's time limited usage.  
**[0:49:48-0:49:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:49:48):**  We should not create dependency on technology or dependency on big machines, but we should  
**[0:49:55-0:50:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:49:55):**  use our abilities to bring it in the position to don't need it anymore.  
**[0:50:02-0:50:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:50:02):**  I think that's a very interesting opinion.  
**[0:50:04-0:50:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:50:04):**  Starting with what's the application of technology as it's becoming bigger and bigger and more  
**[0:50:10-0:50:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:50:10):**  intrusive, etc.  
**[0:50:11-0:50:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:50:11):**  But I think that notion of it should run without technology at some point, then it's much easier  
**[0:50:17-0:50:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:50:17):**  to explain it that way than saying it needs to be nature based biomimicry, etc, etc, because  
**[0:50:22-0:50:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:50:22):**  people get around that all the time.  
**[0:50:23-0:50:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:50:23):**  But it should be able to run at some point relatively quickly, let's hope without the  
**[0:50:28-0:50:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:50:28):**  big diggers or without the software, without the algorithms, without the sensors.  
**[0:50:32-0:50:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:50:32):**  But as you have investors listening to your podcasts, most of the time it's like, hey,  
**[0:50:38-0:50:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:50:38):**  wait, this is a strange thought because many institutions, for instance, run on creating  
**[0:50:43-0:50:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:50:43):**  new problems, new questions, because they want to do new research.  
**[0:50:47-0:50:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:50:47):**  And we tend to create solutions that don't need us anymore.  
**[0:50:51-0:50:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:50:51):**  So we want to be redundant.  
**[0:50:54-0:50:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:50:54):**  Which means you can work on other projects.  
**[0:50:55-0:50:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:50:55):**  There's a world of projects out there to do.  
**[0:50:58-0:51:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:50:58):**  Yes, there's a goal in it itself.  
**[0:51:00-0:51:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:51:00):**  We need to be redundant in the end.  
**[0:51:03-0:51:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:51:03):**  And we are happy to do so as we are also happy to receive a lot of competitors because there's  
**[0:51:08-0:51:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:51:08):**  so much work to do.  
**[0:51:09-0:51:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:51:09):**  But I think you can you can frame it to an investor saying we don't want our limited  
**[0:51:14-0:51:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:51:14):**  resources, which could be software, which could be big machinery, which could be people,  
**[0:51:20-0:51:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:51:20):**  energy, focus, knowledge to be locked in one project, but it needs to be limited in time  
**[0:51:26-0:51:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:51:26):**  because then we can work on another one and another one.  
**[0:51:28-0:51:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:51:28):**  And there's an efficiency that maybe resonates well with with spreadsheet people that say,  
**[0:51:34-0:51:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:51:34):**  I will let's not lock it in there because it will need us forever.  
**[0:51:37-0:51:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:51:37):**  It will break at some point.  
**[0:51:38-0:51:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:51:38):**  It's better to use our limited resources in other places and have more projects.  
**[0:51:43-0:51:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:51:43):**  Final question.  
**[0:51:44-0:51:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:51:44):**  It's never the final one.  
**[0:51:45-0:51:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:51:45):**  But where are you contrarian?  
**[0:51:46-0:51:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:51:46):**  There are many ways.  
**[0:51:48-0:51:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:51:48):**  But in the let's say the region ag and for the regeneration space, the large scale regeneration  
**[0:51:52-0:51:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:51:52):**  space, it's probably not such a busy space.  
**[0:51:54-0:51:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:51:54):**  Unfortunately, we need a lot more people, a lot more resources, a lot more energy and  
**[0:51:57-0:52:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:51:57):**  smart brains thinking about and doing things in the water cycle.  
**[0:52:01-0:52:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:52:01):**  But when you are at these conferences and these events now online, previously offline,  
**[0:52:06-0:52:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:52:06):**  obviously, that's hopefully coming back.  
**[0:52:08-0:52:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:52:08):**  Where do you see this question comes from John Kempf who always asks, it's what do  
**[0:52:11-0:52:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:52:11):**  you believe to be true about regenerative agriculture, in this case, regeneration that  
**[0:52:15-0:52:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:52:15):**  others don't?  
**[0:52:16-0:52:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:52:16):**  So where are you thinking differently?  
**[0:52:18-0:52:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:52:18):**  What do you notice at these coffee tables?  
**[0:52:20-0:52:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:52:20):**  You think, oh, that's weird.  
**[0:52:21-0:52:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:52:21):**  We think very differently about that.  
**[0:52:23-0:52:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:52:23):**  Let's say firstly, we don't go to many of those conferences online or offline, because  
**[0:52:30-0:52:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:52:30):**  I don't think it's where we're going to find the solution.  
**[0:52:33-0:52:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:52:33):**  So it's a lot of energy at this time, I think.  
**[0:52:37-0:52:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:52:37):**  And we're not starting our company to then have like a circus act on stage to tell about  
**[0:52:44-0:52:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:52:44):**  our results.  
**[0:52:46-0:52:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:52:46):**  Although we will have to have a lot of communication and marketing in place when we actually showed  
**[0:52:51-0:52:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:52:51):**  what we can do so that people can start doing it themselves.  
**[0:52:55-0:52:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:52:55):**  So that's a very important thing that we're lacking at this moment.  
**[0:52:59-0:53:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:52:59):**  We need to do better communication and better marketing.  
**[0:53:03-0:53:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:53:03):**  What did trigger me most was to talk about services.  
**[0:53:09-0:53:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:53:09):**  I was at the United Nations UNCCD, a COP in China.  
**[0:53:15-0:53:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:53:15):**  That was the one that I visited.  
**[0:53:17-0:53:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:53:17):**  More than that, we didn't.  
**[0:53:18-0:53:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:53:18):**  And there was a lot of talk about services.  
**[0:53:20-0:53:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:53:20):**  For me, it was like ecosystem services.  
**[0:53:22-0:53:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:53:22):**  Yeah, why are we still talking about what can we take from the land instead of what  
**[0:53:27-0:53:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:53:27):**  can we bring?  
**[0:53:29-0:53:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:53:29):**  Do we really as people still don't understand that our full livelihood is created on a biosphere  
**[0:53:40-0:53:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:53:40):**  which is healthy?  
**[0:53:42-0:53:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:53:42):**  And if the biosphere is not in place, society and economy will not flourish.  
**[0:53:49-0:53:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:53:49):**  So when are we really starting to understand that it's done with just taking and we need  
**[0:53:57-0:54:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:53:57):**  to give the biosphere time to heal and we really need to assist it in that.  
**[0:54:02-0:54:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:54:02):**  So my biggest annoyance was to talk about ecosystem services.  
**[0:54:07-0:54:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:54:07):**  So we talk about ecosystem function because if the system functions well and you understand  
**[0:54:13-0:54:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:54:13):**  how the balance of that system ideally would be to evolve to an abundant system, then you  
**[0:54:19-0:54:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:54:19):**  also understand what you can harvest.  
**[0:54:23-0:54:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:54:23):**  And then you harvest in a sense to have the whole system grow.  
**[0:54:29-0:54:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:54:29):**  So you can take services, but when you understand the function of the system.  
**[0:54:34-0:54:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:54:34):**  So that is, I think that's my main.  
**[0:54:38-0:54:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:54:38):**  I think there's no better way to end this conversation there.  
**[0:54:41-0:54:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:54:41):**  Very well said, the language we use in the space is up for an upgrade and an update,  
**[0:54:47-0:54:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:54:47):**  but it's also the language we inherited from a system that is on its way out.  
**[0:54:52-0:54:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:54:52):**  So we have to deal with it while we're transitioning that.  
**[0:54:54-0:54:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:54:54):**  I want to thank you, Maddy, so much for coming on the podcast and hopefully it's not the  
**[0:54:59-0:55:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:54:59):**  last time.  
**[0:55:00-0:55:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:55:00):**  I'm extremely curious.  
**[0:55:01-0:55:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:55:01):**  I say that very often, but this case it's even more true to follow this over time and  
**[0:55:05-0:55:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:55:05):**  to see where this will lead to.  
**[0:55:07-0:55:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:55:07):**  I mean, there's an ambition here at a scale that we see unfortunately very rarely in this  
**[0:55:12-0:55:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:55:12):**  space.  
**[0:55:13-0:55:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:55:13):**  We often talk about hectares and not about full ecosystems and definitely not about influencing  
**[0:55:18-0:55:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:55:18):**  the weather stabilizing in a region that needs it so desperately.  
**[0:55:24-0:55:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:55:24):**  So thank you so much.  
**[0:55:25-0:55:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:55:25):**  First of all, for the work you do, good luck over the next months to start phase one and  
**[0:55:28-0:55:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:55:28):**  get all the approval you need.  
**[0:55:31-0:55:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:55:31):**  And of course, with all the prototypes and all of that.  
**[0:55:34-0:55:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:55:34):**  Thank you for the time.  
**[0:55:35-0:55:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:55:35):**  And if you find any investors with a plot where we can have some aquatic abundance and  
**[0:55:41-0:55:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:55:41):**  monitor it and create systems around it.  
**[0:55:45-0:55:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/maddie-akkermans#t=0:55:45):**  I'm very happy to hear.

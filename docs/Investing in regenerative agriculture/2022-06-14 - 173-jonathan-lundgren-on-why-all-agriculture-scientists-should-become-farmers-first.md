**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:00:14):**  Checking in with Dr. Jonathan Lundgren, one of the best [[USDA]] ag scientists who left and  
**[0:00:19-0:00:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:00:19):**  started his own farm and research foundation.  
**[0:00:22-0:00:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:00:22):**  What has happened over the last two years since we first chatted?  
**[0:00:25-0:00:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:00:25):**  Has traditional science finally started taking regenerative agriculture more seriously?  
**[0:00:30-0:00:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:00:30):**  And do we finally see more research into profitability and regen practices?  
**[0:00:34-0:00:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:00:34):**  And what about and what is the 1000 farm initiative that John is working on right now?  
**[0:00:46-0:00:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:00:46):**  This is the Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food podcast, Investing as if the Planet  
**[0:00:51-0:00:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:00:51):**  Mattered, where we talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:55-0:01:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:00:55):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:01:00-0:01:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:01:00):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:01:05):**  Why my focus on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:08-0:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:01:08):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:11-0:01:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:01:11):**  our land and our sea, grow our food, what we eat, wear and consume.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:01:16):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:20-0:01:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:01:20):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.

**[0:01:50-0:01:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:01:50):**  Welcome back to another interview.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:01:51):**  Today we have back Dr. Jonathan Lundgren, the founder of Blue Desk Farms and I'm going  
**[0:01:56-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:01:56):**  to butcher this foundation name, Egg Dices Foundation.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:02:00):**  We had him in May 2020.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:02:01):**  You got it.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:02:02):**  Which is almost two years ago, which were an interesting two years to say the least.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:02:07):**  And we talked about almonds, profitability, grains and profitability and the connection  
**[0:02:11-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:02:11):**  to regenerative practices.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:02:12):**  And I think a lot has happened since then, but it's much better to ask it to the man  
**[0:02:17-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:02:17):**  himself.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:02:18):**  So welcome back, John.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:02:19):**  So good to be here again.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:02:22):**  And for the people that of course, I will put the link below on the interview we did  
**[0:02:27-0:02:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:02:27):**  before or the people that didn't listen to that.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:02:28):**  A shame on you.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:02:29):**  Go and listen.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:02:30):**  Not now, but stay here.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:02:31):**  In a few minutes, how would you describe your egg research journey and where did you get  
**[0:02:38-0:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:02:38):**  to where you are now?  
**[0:02:39-0:02:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:02:39):**  Also a few more minutes.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:02:40):**  And it's always interesting to hear this story.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:02:44):**  So I was a scientist within the traditional scientific matrix.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:02:50):**  I worked for USDA for around 11 years and I was very good at that world.  
**[0:02:56-0:02:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:02:56):**  And then I could drive through Iowa.  
**[0:02:57-0:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:02:57):**  He's not saying that to brag by the way.  
**[0:02:58-0:02:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:02:58):**  And just Google it.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:02:59):**  You will see.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:03:02):**  But I could drive through Iowa or Eastern South Dakota and look at acres and acres of  
**[0:03:09-0:03:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:03:09):**  corn and soybeans and cattle.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:03:12):**  And it was like, you know, my research isn't changing anything.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:03:16):**  Farmers aren't getting better.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:03:18):**  It's getting worse for farmers.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:03:20):**  It's getting worse for society and my research is being used to do that.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:03:25):**  And so I've decided it's time for a fundamental shift.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:03:28):**  And so I quit.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:03:31):**  And we started something totally different.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:03:33):**  We started grassroots style science that's rethinking how science is applied in order  
**[0:03:40-0:03:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:03:40):**  to support an evolutionary shift in our food system towards regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:03:46):**  And ever since then, I've been making a lot of mistakes, but having a few wins as well  
**[0:03:51-0:03:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:03:51):**  along the way and just been a part of a movement that's going on in the United States as well  
**[0:03:58-0:04:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:03:58):**  as all over the world right now to save our planet or our place on this planet using our  
**[0:04:03-0:04:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:04:03):**  food system.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:04:04):**  And I think the first major step you took, as you said, I have to become a farmer again  
**[0:04:09-0:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:04:09):**  or have to become a farmer first and then a scientist.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:04:12):**  And that would be good for many other scientists, I would say as well.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:04:15):**  But these wins you mentioned, what are the, I wouldn't say the highlights, but what were  
**[0:04:20-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:04:20):**  the things you look back on now over the last couple of years?  
**[0:04:23-0:04:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:04:23):**  And then we'll talk about the last two years, obviously, of things you like to share the  
**[0:04:27-0:04:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:04:27):**  most when somebody asks, OK, what have you been up to?  
**[0:04:30-0:04:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:04:30):**  What are the things you like to look back on?  
**[0:04:31-0:04:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:04:31):**  Could be the mistakes as well, obviously.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:04:34):**  What are a few things you like to point to?  
**[0:04:36-0:04:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:04:36):**  Well, I think that the relationships that we're building with farmers are one of the  
**[0:04:41-0:04:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:04:41):**  biggest successes and the trust that we're building with farmers and trying to figure  
**[0:04:46-0:04:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:04:46):**  out what is the motivators of decision making on farms.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:04:52):**  And we like to think, oh, you know, it's all about profit, right?  
**[0:04:57-0:05:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:04:57):**  But honestly, if farmers were really interested and driven by profits, they wouldn't be growing  
**[0:05:03-0:05:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:05:03):**  corn and beans.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:05:04):**  They'd be growing something totally different.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:05:07):**  And so there's some other sociological elements there.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:05:12):**  And cracking that nut has been a really important part of this.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:05:18):**  Yeah, just becoming a farmer and our own changes on Blue Dasher Farm here in South Dakota,  
**[0:05:26-0:05:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:05:26):**  and watching that and how that's changed our approach to science and our approach to life  
**[0:05:32-0:05:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:05:32):**  has been a really fun outcome of the...an important outcome of this whole initiative.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:05:41):**  You know, scientists have to be farmers.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:05:43):**  We can't be addressing farmer needs without experiencing that firsthand.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:05:49):**  And the relationships and trust that are associated with that end up driving a far grander impact  
**[0:05:56-0:06:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:05:56):**  of our research than could be attained if we were just working at a normal institution.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:06:04):**  And so what have been the last two years, the biggest surprises?  
**[0:06:08-0:06:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:06:08):**  What have you learned the most of running the farm alongside doing a lot of research?  
**[0:06:13-0:06:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:06:13):**  And what has been...because the farm, I think, I'm guessing started five years ago.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:06:17):**  I don't remember the exact date.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:06:19):**  It's been relatively new and fresh.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:06:21):**  And then especially the first five years in any transition are full of surprises, let's  
**[0:06:26-0:06:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:06:26):**  say.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:06:27):**  As a farmer, putting your farmer head on, what have been the biggest lessons learned  
**[0:06:30-0:06:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:06:30):**  over the last two years since we spoke?  
**[0:06:35-0:06:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:06:35):**  We became a livestock farm.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:06:37):**  We started real focused on crops.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:06:40):**  That's what I knew and thought was the important thing.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:06:45):**  And now I think our bread and butter is lamb production, pork, poultry, eggs, and honey.  
**[0:06:53-0:07:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:06:53):**  Those are the things that we think are the most beneficial for the land as well as for  
**[0:07:01-0:07:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:07:01):**  ourselves and our community.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:07:02):**  Those are the things we enjoy producing the most.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:07:06):**  What triggered that if it's not profitable?  
**[0:07:08-0:07:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:07:08):**  Because you just mentioned farmers are potentially not driven by, probably not driven by profits  
**[0:07:13-0:07:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:07:13):**  alone.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:07:14):**  What triggered that?  
**[0:07:15-0:07:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:07:15):**  Because you went into it as a crop farmer, a potentially vegetable farmer, and livestock  
**[0:07:19-0:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:07:19):**  is very different.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:07:21):**  What was their moment?  
**[0:07:22-0:07:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:07:22):**  When did that realization came?  
**[0:07:24-0:07:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:07:24):**  Okay, we need or we want animals on this farm?  
**[0:07:28-0:07:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:07:28):**  Well, I think it harkens back to when we got started.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:07:33):**  One of my friends who was a farmer, 75-year-old fella, a really good regenerative farmer.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:07:41):**  He's like, you know, a farm just doesn't feel like a farm without livestock.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:07:47):**  And I think he was right.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:07:49):**  There's something fundamentally human about being around animals that I don't know if  
**[0:07:57-0:07:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:07:57):**  it's a spiritual thing or what.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:07:59):**  You cannot see it, but he's smiling a lot when he's talking about animals.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:08:03):**  Yeah.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:08:04):**  I just don't understand what it is, but there's fundamentally something that we feel connected  
**[0:08:10-0:08:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:08:10):**  to when we're raising our animals and caring for those animals.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:08:16):**  So I really like that aspect of it.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:08:19):**  The other element that I'm starting to realize more and more is that in order for us, you  
**[0:08:26-0:08:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:08:26):**  know, regenerative agriculture isn't really even the answer to our planetary scale problems.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:08:33):**  It's a more fundamental sociological shift that needs to happen right now, that we need  
**[0:08:40-0:08:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:08:40):**  to as a society slow down.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:08:44):**  We need to start growing our own food.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:08:46):**  We need to start connecting with something because I feel like we're just losing track  
**[0:08:52-0:08:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:08:52):**  of where we fit in this world anymore.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:08:57):**  And as an artifact of that, this industrialized food system that's having all kinds of problems  
**[0:09:05-0:09:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:09:05):**  ends up evolving and the culture ends up evolving that uses currencies that don't make us feel  
**[0:09:14-0:09:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:09:14):**  whole.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:09:15):**  And animals, I've heard a farmer say that the ideal way of living is herding animals  
**[0:09:23-0:09:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:09:23):**  or sort of moving with the animals in their migrations or their nomadic lifestyle and  
**[0:09:30-0:09:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:09:30):**  our lifestyle is a bad word here, but do you feel like this shift or the addition of animals  
**[0:09:37-0:09:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:09:37):**  on farms is one of those missing puzzle pieces or one of those to slow down, to force to  
**[0:09:45-0:09:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:09:45):**  slow down or to force to ask harder questions, which you don't have to ask if you're doing  
**[0:09:49-0:09:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:09:49):**  vegetables or row crops?  
**[0:09:51-0:09:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:09:51):**  Yeah, you know, I really do.  
**[0:09:54-0:09:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:09:54):**  And you know, as a scientist, I can step back and say, okay, well, there's a lot of ways  
**[0:09:58-0:10:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:09:58):**  of penciling this out and saying, well, the resilience of the operation is improved with  
**[0:10:03-0:10:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:10:03):**  an additional revenue stream and all of these other things, right?  
**[0:10:09-0:10:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:10:09):**  And there's a lot of roles that livestock play as a tool for managing vegetation and  
**[0:10:14-0:10:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:10:14):**  all this other sort of things and all of that's true.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:10:19):**  But then there's also this element of, you know what?  
**[0:10:22-0:10:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:10:22):**  I'm connected to this place.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:10:25):**  It forces me to get out of bed in the middle of winter and go out there and feed the animals  
**[0:10:32-0:10:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:10:32):**  and there's something very mentally stimulating and healthy about that.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:10:37):**  Yeah, there's just, it's bigger than that and it's harder to put a number on it.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:10:44):**  And then does it bother you or do you get pushed back on the whole, do we have to eat  
**[0:10:54-0:11:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:10:54):**  them then, discussion like this slaughtering, like the caring for what about the one bad  
**[0:11:00-0:11:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:11:00):**  day as Joao Salatin mentions it, is that do you then put your scientist hat on?  
**[0:11:05-0:11:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:11:05):**  Okay, it's fundamental for the land, for us, for health, for the economics, or what does  
**[0:11:12-0:11:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:11:12):**  the non-scientist and the farmer hat or the rancher, in this case, I think with livestock,  
**[0:11:16-0:11:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:11:16):**  we have to call you a rancher, hat tells you dare or how has that been for you over the  
**[0:11:22-0:11:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:11:22):**  last two years to also be there with the bad days?  
**[0:11:27-0:11:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:11:27):**  That's yeah, that is, I think that's a great way of saying it, that that's a really bad  
**[0:11:31-0:11:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:11:31):**  day and that's not something that I crave or look forward to, but it's a part of this  
**[0:11:37-0:11:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:11:37):**  whole thing.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:11:38):**  And I respect the hell out of the animals that are on this farm and treat them as well  
**[0:11:45-0:11:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:11:45):**  as I possibly can and they're a part of me.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:11:50):**  And so yeah, that cycle is there and that's another part of being human too, is understanding  
**[0:11:59-0:12:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:11:59):**  that there's an end and accepting that and being a part of that.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:12:09):**  And then when you put your scientist hat on, like how, I wouldn't say like how does it  
**[0:12:14-0:12:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:12:14):**  scale because it's such a, but going or looking at the current agriculture or animal agriculture  
**[0:12:20-0:12:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:12:20):**  system, the industrialized CAFO operations, et cetera, how would that transition, but  
**[0:12:30-0:12:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:12:30):**  do you see a transition possible there?  
**[0:12:33-0:12:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:12:33):**  Do you see with getting the animals back on the land, caring for the land, caring for  
**[0:12:39-0:12:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:12:39):**  the animals, like how is there a shift happening with that or is it still very much one side,  
**[0:12:46-0:12:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:12:46):**  okay, let's squeeze in as much grain and beans as possible into these animals in a closed  
**[0:12:51-0:12:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:12:51):**  system and then there's some grass fed and finished people on the other side and the  
**[0:12:55-0:13:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:12:55):**  vegan movement in the other corner and they were all shouting at each other basically.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:13:00):**  Has something shifted there in the last two years as you've become a livestock farmer  
**[0:13:04-0:13:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:13:04):**  yourself now as well?  
**[0:13:05-0:13:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:13:05):**  Do you take a middle ground or do you feel maybe more extreme than before?  
**[0:13:10-0:13:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:13:10):**  What has happened in that, has that shaped your research even as well?  
**[0:13:14-0:13:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:13:14):**  Yeah, so there was something that happened last year that was really fundamentally changing  
**[0:13:21-0:13:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:13:21):**  to me and it pertains to this question.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:13:26):**  We started working in regenerative dairy and the first step in that question is what the  
**[0:13:32-0:13:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:13:32):**  hell is regenerative dairy?  
**[0:13:33-0:13:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:13:33):**  I mean, what does that look like, right?  
**[0:13:36-0:13:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:13:36):**  And nobody's really tried to define that and so the first step in that process was me experiencing  
**[0:13:43-0:13:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:13:43):**  different dairy operations, me and the scientific staff and so we started to do some tours of  
**[0:13:47-0:13:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:13:47):**  some operations.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:13:48):**  Alexandra Farms and things like that.  
**[0:13:52-0:13:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:13:52):**  And going into this, I mean, there's a ton of large CAFO dairy operations that are springing  
**[0:13:59-0:14:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:13:59):**  up in South Dakota.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:14:02):**  They're spilling in from California because the regulations are more stringent there and  
**[0:14:08-0:14:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:14:08):**  South Dakota says, bring us your CAFOs, right?  
**[0:14:12-0:14:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:14:12):**  Why not?  
**[0:14:13-0:14:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:14:13):**  Which is, oh, it's really disturbing to me and I can say, man, people who run these operations  
**[0:14:21-0:14:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:14:21):**  are morally challenged.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:14:24):**  They're obviously disconnected from what they're trying to do.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:14:28):**  To these animals, they can't even picture a life living in a confinement that they never  
**[0:14:36-0:14:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:14:36):**  see green grass, right?  
**[0:14:38-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:14:38):**  They never get out.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:14:40):**  And so I went in there with that viewpoint and then I met the farmers that were doing  
**[0:14:47-0:14:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:14:47):**  it and these farmers care about their animals and they have automation and technology to  
**[0:14:55-0:15:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:14:55):**  try to assess if there's an injured or sick animal and they try to treat it within that  
**[0:15:00-0:15:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:15:00):**  context and they are 100% confined.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:15:07):**  The confined animal on a dairy or in a CAFO or in a hog yard or anything like that in  
**[0:15:15-0:15:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:15:15):**  the animal, it's the farmer.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:15:17):**  They are stuck.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:15:19):**  They are saddled with debt for generations because somebody convinced them, the CAFO  
**[0:15:26-0:15:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:15:26):**  builder convinced them that this would be a good business decision.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:15:34):**  And for the rest of their lives, they are trying to dig themselves out of that horrendous  
**[0:15:38-0:15:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:15:38):**  debt.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:15:39):**  And I felt differently about that, that I wanted to be there to give another option  
**[0:15:49-0:15:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:15:49):**  and to try to figure out how to help these people.  
**[0:15:53-0:16:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:15:53):**  If one of those milking machines goes down for even a day or two, the whole system starts  
**[0:16:01-0:16:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:16:01):**  to break, right?  
**[0:16:03-0:16:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:16:03):**  Because they can't go anywhere.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:16:07):**  And so how are the conversations with them then?  
**[0:16:10-0:16:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:16:10):**  What do you talk about?  
**[0:16:11-0:16:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:16:11):**  I mean, they must have Googled you before you came and you come with very different  
**[0:16:15-0:16:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:16:15):**  operations as well, let's say.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:16:17):**  What are they?  
**[0:16:18-0:16:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:16:18):**  Are they curious?  
**[0:16:19-0:16:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:16:19):**  Are they asking questions or maybe they don't want to see because it just makes you very  
**[0:16:22-0:16:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:16:22):**  sad if you're locked into something and you see, I would say the green grass outside,  
**[0:16:26-0:16:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:16:26):**  but you see other options.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:16:28):**  It could also be very, very depressing.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:16:34):**  Well I think admitting that you're trapped and that your children are trapped, they can  
**[0:16:44-0:16:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:16:44):**  admit it on one hand, but not understand that there's an alternative.  
**[0:16:52-0:16:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:16:52):**  And so that's kind of the confinement, I guess, is that there.  
**[0:16:56-0:16:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:16:56):**  And have you seen alternatives?  
**[0:16:57-0:17:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:16:57):**  Have you seen other, like you've visited multiple ones, I'm imagining multiple styles  
**[0:17:02-0:17:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:17:02):**  or systems and were the ones that made you happy and made you, even though the dairy  
**[0:17:08-0:17:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:17:08):**  gets always the huge pushback of like, should we even be consuming milk because of the whole  
**[0:17:17-0:17:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:17:17):**  mother calf, let's say challenge.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:17:21):**  And like, what do you see there?  
**[0:17:22-0:17:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:17:22):**  And like the best performing or the best ones you visited, how did they approach that tension  
**[0:17:26-0:17:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:17:26):**  or that dynamic?  
**[0:17:30-0:17:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:17:30):**  The best ones have animals that are on green grass every day.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:17:35):**  And we literally saw, we went from that CAFO dairy to a small pasture dairy operation where  
**[0:17:44-0:17:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:17:44):**  they grow local milk for their community that's raw milk.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:17:49):**  And the animals were literally like jaunting and running through the pasture.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:17:58):**  They looked like totally different animals, right?  
**[0:18:02-0:18:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:18:02):**  And their calves were in association with them.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:18:07):**  And yeah, it was just a, it was a totally different ball game.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:18:13):**  But the scale was much smaller.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:18:18):**  And the more that I think about this, the more I, you know, we have to understand that  
**[0:18:28-0:18:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:18:28):**  we need a lot more farmers and we need to be connected to our own food production.  
**[0:18:34-0:18:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:18:34):**  I mean, when you think about scaling, like farm to school or farm to local communities  
**[0:18:40-0:18:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:18:40):**  or something like that, when you have millions of people aggregated, not all of those people  
**[0:18:45-0:18:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:18:45):**  can learn their farmers.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:18:46):**  I mean, when you think about, okay, if you've got 400 kids in a small elementary school  
**[0:18:51-0:18:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:18:51):**  or something like that, that's 400 carrots a day that you need to produce.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:18:57):**  And the scale that's needed there, suddenly you start thinking, okay, how do you accomplish  
**[0:19:02-0:19:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:19:02):**  this?  
**[0:19:03-0:19:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:19:03):**  And I think more people need to grow food.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:19:07):**  And so why aren't we, in a sense, I mean, it seems to be happening as well.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:19:10):**  Is that partly that we don't think there's a career there?  
**[0:19:15-0:19:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:19:15):**  We I mean, people in the city, let's quote unquote, let's let's generalize here.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:19:18):**  But like, what, what would be needed to unlock many more people?  
**[0:19:24-0:19:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:19:24):**  Let's go from 1%, I think, in the US is involved in farming to 10%.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:19:28):**  Like, what would be needed to do that?  
**[0:19:30-0:19:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:19:30):**  Or do you have any ideas on that?  
**[0:19:32-0:19:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:19:32):**  Maybe you say, I don't know.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:19:36):**  This is it.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:19:37):**  This is an impossible question about these issues every day.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:19:39):**  We have conversations here in our research team every day or scientific team.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:19:43):**  And that's just a part of our culture, right?  
**[0:19:47-0:19:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:19:47):**  There's enough people throwing their hands up saying, I don't know, we need somebody  
**[0:19:50-0:19:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:19:50):**  that's doing something.  
**[0:19:52-0:20:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:19:52):**  And you know, steps in this process are number one, it again, it hearkens back to this concept  
**[0:20:00-0:20:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:20:00):**  of our society needs to change.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:20:05):**  Our best farm sales was the day after COVID was announced.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:20:11):**  Because people weren't running to the fast food restaurants.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:20:15):**  They were thinking about cooking, they were thinking some of that stuck, like after in  
**[0:20:20-0:20:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:20:20):**  the end, like, because I saw some of these things obviously went 300%, etc.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:20:25):**  And most of them, something stayed there, not all, but many of the direct to consumer  
**[0:20:30-0:20:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:20:30):**  ones, and not direct to restaurants ones.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:20:33):**  I mean, that was a difficult business.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:20:35):**  Although it's coming back, but direct to consumer, some of that stayed.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:20:37):**  Is that the same with you?  
**[0:20:38-0:20:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:20:38):**  Are you now operating at a higher level of sales?  
**[0:20:42-0:20:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:20:42):**  Yeah, I think we are.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:20:44):**  And people are understanding that a little bit more too.  
**[0:20:49-0:20:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:20:49):**  It did, you know, I mean, society resumed its rat race, but at a different pace, I think.  
**[0:20:57-0:21:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:20:57):**  There's a larger proportion of the United States population that are just slowing down  
**[0:21:02-0:21:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:21:02):**  and not going back to work, realizing that they were working to pay somebody else to  
**[0:21:07-0:21:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:21:07):**  raise their children, for example, or to grow their food.  
**[0:21:11-0:21:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:21:11):**  Yeah, or to grow their food.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:21:15):**  And that shift, I think, is going to amplify.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:21:19):**  I think there was a lie that was told to society that we believed, and that was that the currency  
**[0:21:27-0:21:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:21:27):**  that was most important was money.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:21:30):**  And there's a lot of other currencies that make us feel like ourselves, like human beings.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:21:39):**  And that's not saying that money isn't important or anything like that.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:21:42):**  Says the guy that the only one that ever did research on profitability and regenerate.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:21:46):**  But yeah, that doesn't mean that profit is the only thing that drives you, obviously.  
**[0:21:51-0:21:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:21:51):**  So isn't that interesting?  
**[0:21:52-0:21:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:21:52):**  I mean, that's been a real evolution over the last two years for us.  
**[0:21:56-0:21:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:21:56):**  Sure, we can provide those numbers, but we know that that's not going to happen.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:21:59):**  Which are very compelling.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:22:00):**  That's not I mean, anybody that's interested, can it be profitable to go and look at the  
**[0:22:04-0:22:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:22:04):**  papers?  
**[0:22:05-0:22:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:22:05):**  They are extremely compelling.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:22:06):**  Of course it's profitable.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:22:08):**  And we're about to have one on rangelands coming out.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:22:11):**  And we have cash grain systems in the northern plains coming out.  
**[0:22:15-0:22:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:22:15):**  We're in vineyards and cherries and apples and all across the United States, a thousand  
**[0:22:21-0:22:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:22:21):**  farms we're going to be visiting.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:22:24):**  And we'll be doing full economic analyses on each of these things, right?  
**[0:22:28-0:22:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:22:28):**  And in all these different crops, the general, because I always say, obviously, you look  
**[0:22:32-0:22:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:22:32):**  at higher profitability or at least the same lower volatility, lower costs.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:22:38):**  Is that a general or does it really depend on the crop or is that the general, say, the  
**[0:22:44-0:22:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:22:44):**  red thread that goes through all of these when you're looking at all of these different  
**[0:22:48-0:22:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:22:48):**  crops and different contexts, et cetera?  
**[0:22:49-0:22:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:22:49):**  If you had to summarize it, what would be there?  
**[0:22:53-0:22:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:22:53):**  Is there a connection between region practices and done well, obviously, and profitability?  
**[0:22:59-0:23:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:22:59):**  Yeah.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:23:00):**  And so essentially, if we'd really dumb it down, it's lower input costs and greater profits.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:23:10):**  And depending on the system that you're looking at, the relative contributions to the overall  
**[0:23:15-0:23:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:23:15):**  profitability are different.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:23:18):**  But for corn, lowering input costs was the primary reason for the overall net profitability  
**[0:23:25-0:23:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:23:25):**  increasing.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:23:26):**  In almonds, you didn't lose money by going regenerative, but you did gain money based  
**[0:23:32-0:23:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:23:32):**  on premiums that are associated with that, the end product.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:23:37):**  And so-  
**[0:23:38-0:23:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:23:38):**  It depends.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:23:39):**  But yeah, the bottom line-  
**[0:23:41-0:23:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:23:41):**  Depends, but it's always net profitability is always higher.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:23:45):**  Yeah, and we talked about it as well last time on the almond side, I remember, of course,  
**[0:23:52-0:23:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:23:52):**  it's not all about, and it shouldn't be about profitability, but a small increase there  
**[0:23:56-0:23:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:23:56):**  could mean your children stay on the farm.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:23:58):**  And a small increase on these things mean a fundamental difference.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:24:02):**  If you're so at the edge in terms of margins and profitability, 10k, 20k, or whatever per  
**[0:24:07-0:24:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:24:07):**  year, and some of it makes an enormous difference because somebody can stay and makes an enormous  
**[0:24:12-0:24:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:24:12):**  difference because new energy comes in and makes an enormous difference to drive this  
**[0:24:16-0:24:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:24:16):**  or gets other currency, which could be family or time around or whatever other currencies  
**[0:24:22-0:24:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:24:22):**  we come up with.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:24:23):**  So it is fundamental to, I think, to dispel the myth of this is all nice and fun, but  
**[0:24:29-0:24:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:24:29):**  only if you are a rich landholder that doesn't have to live off the farm, you can do these  
**[0:24:34-0:24:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:24:34):**  kinds of hobbies.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:24:35):**  That's the like, yeah, that's not true.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:24:38):**  No, that's not that at all.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:24:40):**  It's the only way that we're going to, our farming community is going to remain profitable.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:24:47):**  And what holds the rest back?  
**[0:24:49-0:24:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:24:49):**  If this data is available, I remember that almond farmers finally won, like the two farmers,  
**[0:24:55-0:25:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:24:55):**  one of the two you looked at, visited the other one and looked at the profitability  
**[0:25:00-0:25:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:25:00):**  or looked at the pest number, sorry.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:25:02):**  And so that even though he sprayed five times a year, did exactly what the universities  
**[0:25:05-0:25:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:25:05):**  told him, he had the same amount of pests as his neighbor who never sprayed.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:25:09):**  That was a trigger moment.  
**[0:25:10-0:25:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:25:10):**  What other trigger moments do we need if the data is so clear?  
**[0:25:14-0:25:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:25:14):**  What is holding us back to seriously scale or is it happening and we're just not seeing  
**[0:25:19-0:25:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:25:19):**  it yet because it's so much, it's like an underground movement?  
**[0:25:24-0:25:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:25:24):**  You know that one farmer, just to take one step back, in year one, after that study that  
**[0:25:32-0:25:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:25:32):**  we published, he couldn't believe it, right?  
**[0:25:35-0:25:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:25:35):**  That he changed 160 acres over to regenerative the next year and now he's changed his entire  
**[0:25:42-0:25:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:25:42):**  1000 acre almond operation to regenerative.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:25:47):**  So what is it that inspires those changes?  
**[0:25:51-0:25:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:25:51):**  The thing that we've had to realize is that we have to have the data, but it's not sufficient.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:25:58):**  When we got started, I mean, we can have that conversation, two years ago regenerative was  
**[0:26:05-0:26:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:26:05):**  a dirty word in almonds.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:26:07):**  I mean, you couldn't go into the Central Valley of California and talk about regenerative  
**[0:26:12-0:26:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:26:12):**  because regenerative doesn't work here, right?  
**[0:26:15-0:26:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:26:15):**  Like it's a thing.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:26:17):**  It's also funny.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:26:18):**  And even after seeing the data.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:26:19):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:26:20):**  Right, right.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:26:21):**  The data, even after the data came out that said it was twice as profitable and all these  
**[0:26:25-0:26:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:26:25):**  other wonderful metrics, carbon sequestration, life promotion, water is huge out there.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:26:32):**  That wasn't enough, right?  
**[0:26:34-0:26:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:26:34):**  Regenerative still isn't okay.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:26:35):**  You know what changed is we had a presence there.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:26:40):**  The scientists would show up and we would talk to the farmers and we weren't selling  
**[0:26:45-0:26:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:26:45):**  them anything, right?  
**[0:26:49-0:26:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:26:49):**  Instantly the farmer, when you walk onto a farmer's field or into their office, they're  
**[0:26:54-0:26:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:26:54):**  wondering what's this guy going to sell me?  
**[0:26:58-0:27:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:26:58):**  And suddenly they were like, oh, you want to give us $7,500 worth of free information  
**[0:27:03-0:27:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:27:03):**  about our farm because you just want to help?  
**[0:27:07-0:27:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:27:07):**  That was like a weird, weird thing.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:27:10):**  Yeah, we didn't trust it either.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:27:13):**  We had a field day a couple of months ago, 320 people from up and down the Central Valley  
**[0:27:18-0:27:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:27:18):**  came to that field day and it was regenerative almonds.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:27:22):**  The almond board showed up even.  
**[0:27:26-0:27:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:27:26):**  Was there a lot of skepticism or was there real interest?  
**[0:27:33-0:27:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:27:33):**  There was real interest and we're working with some of the largest almond producers  
**[0:27:37-0:27:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:27:37):**  in the state now, helping them to make a transition.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:27:41):**  And when they say, you know, this can't work, you know, I'm not going to make that management.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:27:45):**  It's like, all right, to hell with you then.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:27:47):**  You know what?  
**[0:27:48-0:27:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:27:48):**  We don't have time for this.  
**[0:27:49-0:27:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:27:49):**  If you're serious about change, we'll work with you.  
**[0:27:52-0:27:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:27:52):**  But if you're not, don't waste our time.  
**[0:27:55-0:27:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:27:55):**  And you know what?  
**[0:27:56-0:28:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:27:56):**  What I told them that really got their attention is regenerative agriculture is the future  
**[0:28:05-0:28:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:28:05):**  of your industry.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:28:06):**  You can either change and evolve with it or you can go out of business.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:28:10):**  And I don't care one way or the other, but I'll be there if you're interested in making  
**[0:28:15-0:28:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:28:15):**  that change.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:28:18):**  That's yep, they got that.  
**[0:28:20-0:28:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:28:20):**  They're not used to somebody saying that.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:28:22):**  No, because everybody tries to sell them something obviously.  
**[0:28:24-0:28:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:28:24):**  And has the last, I would say six months of political tension and obviously the war we're  
**[0:28:30-0:28:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:28:30):**  in now, especially around input prices, like has that, we all expected, or maybe I expected  
**[0:28:37-0:28:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:28:37):**  that that would start some serious conversations about high input driven extractive agriculture.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:28:45):**  Very, very fragile because inputs come, apart from the fact that they're extremely damaging  
**[0:28:48-0:28:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:28:48):**  and all of that, but also just very fragile because they come from far and support certain  
**[0:28:53-0:28:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:28:53):**  regimes that we're not too happy about.  
**[0:28:55-0:29:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:28:55):**  Let's say, has that, like have the last months been more intensive in terms of inbound calls?  
**[0:29:01-0:29:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:29:01):**  People are interested, people that were a bit on the fence of this weird bio fertilizer  
**[0:29:05-0:29:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:29:05):**  stuff and compost and et cetera.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:29:06):**  Like suddenly you're like, let me give it a try because these prices are not sustainable  
**[0:29:10-0:29:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:29:10):**  or has that not happened yet?  
**[0:29:13-0:29:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:29:13):**  You know, we're hearing about that.  
**[0:29:15-0:29:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:29:15):**  We're making that a part of our dialogue, you know, for, it hasn't really changed anything  
**[0:29:21-0:29:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:29:21):**  except maybe in terms of magnitude, but the same trends were there.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:29:27):**  Input costs, I mean, farmers haven't made more money over the last several years.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:29:35):**  Input costs continue to rise, profits, you know, there's a lot more money being made  
**[0:29:39-0:29:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:29:39):**  off of farming, but it isn't about from the farmers.  
**[0:29:44-0:29:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:29:44):**  It's about all of the other people that have come in to make money off of these farmers.  
**[0:29:52-0:30:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:29:52):**  And so as input costs rise, the farmers are, yeah, I mean, prices can go up, right?  
**[0:30:00-0:30:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:30:00):**  Corn and soybean prices are through the roof right now, but farmers aren't going to make  
**[0:30:04-0:30:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:30:04):**  more money.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:30:05):**  They're going to put it all into the inputs.  
**[0:30:07-0:30:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:30:07):**  And so these companies that are parasitizing the farmers are making a ton of cash.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:30:14):**  But that isn't okay, right?  
**[0:30:16-0:30:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:30:16):**  And so what is it?  
**[0:30:18-0:30:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:30:18):**  You mentioned it before, but let's unpack it a bit.  
**[0:30:20-0:30:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:30:20):**  The 1000 Farm Initiative to, I think it feels really to bring this type of research to a  
**[0:30:25-0:30:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:30:25):**  whole new level and a whole new scale because 1000 sounds like a lot.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:30:30):**  What was the reasoning or the thought behind it and what is this initiative and how, and  
**[0:30:35-0:30:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:30:35):**  then we talk about how people can get involved obviously.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:30:38):**  Sure.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:30:39):**  So we're on the edge of a cliff, we're looking over and there's a real sense of urgency.  
**[0:30:50-0:30:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:30:50):**  We just drove down to Kansas City to visit some family this weekend and we watched the  
**[0:30:55-0:30:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:30:55):**  dust blow the entire way down.  
**[0:30:59-0:31:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:30:59):**  Oklahoma, Kansas right now are burning.  
**[0:31:04-0:31:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:31:04):**  Colorado burned last year.  
**[0:31:06-0:31:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:31:06):**  We had to wear masks in South Dakota because Manitoba was burning.  
**[0:31:12-0:31:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:31:12):**  This is end of days kind of shit going on right now.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:31:17):**  And so we decided, we know what the answer is.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:31:21):**  How do we get this done?  
**[0:31:22-0:31:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:31:22):**  How do we move the ball down the field much more quickly?  
**[0:31:26-0:31:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:31:26):**  And we know the style of science that we're doing is something that only we know how to  
**[0:31:33-0:31:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:31:33):**  do and let's amp it up.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:31:35):**  And so we decided to run a full systems assessment on 1000 farms per year around North America  
**[0:31:45-0:31:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:31:45):**  with plans to upgrade this or upscale this globally where we deploy scientific teams  
**[0:31:51-0:31:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:31:51):**  to measure entire systems.  
**[0:31:54-0:32:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:31:54):**  So deep carbon, soil, physical chemical properties, water, invertebrates, microbes, plants, birds,  
**[0:32:03-0:32:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:32:03):**  nutrients, density of the foods, economics on each of these fields, 1000 fields per year  
**[0:32:12-0:32:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:32:12):**  across the country to show or to ask, does regen work no matter what you grow, where  
**[0:32:19-0:32:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:32:19):**  you grow it?  
**[0:32:21-0:32:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:32:21):**  Farmers are developing systems of regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:32:26):**  How can we use empirical assessments to make roadmaps to remove risks associated with this  
**[0:32:33-0:32:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:32:33):**  transition process?  
**[0:32:36-0:32:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:32:36):**  And then does regen deliver on its promises?  
**[0:32:41-0:32:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:32:41):**  Is this the solution to climate change that people are talking about?  
**[0:32:45-0:32:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:32:45):**  Does it reverse desertification?  
**[0:32:47-0:32:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:32:47):**  Does it improve rural community status?  
**[0:32:51-0:32:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:32:51):**  And so we've done these assessments on more than 100 farms this year already.  
**[0:32:59-0:33:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:32:59):**  And it's on the farm level, so not just on a field level, but on a farm scale or depending  
**[0:33:03-0:33:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:33:03):**  on the farm I'm measuring.  
**[0:33:04-0:33:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:33:04):**  Our experimental unit is the field, but yeah, just because we have to.  
**[0:33:11-0:33:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:33:11):**  A farm ends up becoming a much more complicated endeavor, but yeah, this should scale to the  
**[0:33:18-0:33:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:33:18):**  whole farms once you start incorporating the different elements of it.  
**[0:33:24-0:33:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:33:24):**  And so how soon do you want to get to 1000?  
**[0:33:29-0:33:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:33:29):**  So 1000 this year, 1000 fields on farms this year?  
**[0:33:33-0:33:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:33:33):**  You're en route for that?  
**[0:33:35-0:33:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:33:35):**  We're on 500 farms this year and we'll be on 1000 farms per year next year through 2026  
**[0:33:43-0:33:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:33:43):**  or so.  
**[0:33:44-0:33:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:33:44):**  And then we'll be monitoring those transition farms for up to 10 years.  
**[0:33:48-0:33:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:33:48):**  So but we'll be, yeah, when we come out of a field, we have almost all of the data in  
**[0:33:54-0:34:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:33:54):**  hand so we can give that back free for the farmers.  
**[0:34:01-0:34:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:34:01):**  And then we can consolidate it.  
**[0:34:03-0:34:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:34:03):**  It's all anonymized, right?  
**[0:34:04-0:34:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:34:04):**  None of the farmer's information is associated with it, but then we can kind of give that  
**[0:34:08-0:34:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:34:08):**  off to decision makers, policy makers, people that are coming up with verification ideas  
**[0:34:16-0:34:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:34:16):**  for region, people that are trying to conduct forecasting models on carbon or what have  
**[0:34:24-0:34:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:34:24):**  you.  
**[0:34:26-0:34:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:34:26):**  We've got ground truth data on a scale that's never even been attempted before.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:34:32):**  And have you already seen what are the first, I wouldn't say results, but first things you've  
**[0:34:38-0:34:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:34:38):**  seen in this 100 farms or farm fields until now?  
**[0:34:42-0:34:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:34:42):**  Is there something you can share on surprises or non-surprises you've seen until now?  
**[0:34:49-0:34:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:34:49):**  The consistencies across these systems, I mean, you can walk into, but yeah, we're also  
**[0:34:56-0:34:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:34:56):**  in terms of results, right?  
**[0:34:58-0:35:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:34:58):**  I mean, you go onto a regenerative field and life is just through the roof compared to  
**[0:35:03-0:35:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:35:03):**  its conventional counterpart.  
**[0:35:05-0:35:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:35:05):**  And that's really indicative- That's what you do?  
**[0:35:06-0:35:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:35:06):**  I saw you look like a conventional counterpart or conventional neighbor.  
**[0:35:11-0:35:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:35:11):**  That's our control group.  
**[0:35:13-0:35:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:35:13):**  So those are our controls.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:35:15):**  We're benchmarking everything against conventional, successful conventional operations.  
**[0:35:24-0:35:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:35:24):**  But the differences are palpable and the solutions are palpable.  
**[0:35:29-0:35:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:35:29):**  What does palpable mean?  
**[0:35:30-0:35:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:35:30):**  Like available, you can feel it, you can taste it?  
**[0:35:33-0:35:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:35:33):**  You can feel them.  
**[0:35:34-0:35:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:35:34):**  Okay.  
**[0:35:35-0:35:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:35:35):**  Yeah.  
**[0:35:36-0:35:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:35:36):**  I mean, as a scientist, I have to turn everything that I'm seeing into a number and that's hard  
**[0:35:42-0:35:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:35:42):**  sometimes.  
**[0:35:43-0:35:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:35:43):**  I mean, you walk onto a regenerative almond operation in the middle of the hottest part  
**[0:35:48-0:35:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:35:48):**  of the Central Valley and where they tell us that regen won't work.  
**[0:35:56-0:36:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:35:56):**  And you can, I mean, the Central Valley used to be a wetland and now it's a desert.  
**[0:36:02-0:36:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:36:02):**  And you walk onto one of these farms and the temperature is cooler and you hear birds in  
**[0:36:10-0:36:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:36:10):**  the air and you can smell life.  
**[0:36:16-0:36:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:36:16):**  And turning that into a number is really challenging.  
**[0:36:18-0:36:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:36:18):**  So what do you do then?  
**[0:36:19-0:36:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:36:19):**  What do you do, John?  
**[0:36:20-0:36:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:36:20):**  How do you turn it into a number that we can send to policymakers?  
**[0:36:23-0:36:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:36:23):**  We take redundant metrics of measurements of each of these different facets of the system  
**[0:36:29-0:36:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:36:29):**  and consolidate it.  
**[0:36:31-0:36:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:36:31):**  But boy, won't that be nice when we can consolidate that into an index of some sort of environmental  
**[0:36:37-0:36:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:36:37):**  quality or something based on how many birds, how many bugs.  
**[0:36:41-0:36:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:36:41):**  It's all trends and scales together.  
**[0:36:44-0:36:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:36:44):**  Even the profitability scales with how much life you have on that farm.  
**[0:36:48-0:36:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:36:48):**  So are there really no trade-offs there?  
**[0:36:50-0:36:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:36:50):**  Have you seen trade-offs there?  
**[0:36:52-0:36:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:36:52):**  Maybe on the speed of the transition or on the complexity, if you, maybe that's not even  
**[0:36:57-0:36:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:36:57):**  possible, but over-complexify.  
**[0:36:58-0:37:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:36:58):**  Have you seen any trade-offs in the signal so far or the results so far?  
**[0:37:04-0:37:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:37:04):**  No.  
**[0:37:05-0:37:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:37:05):**  So just an amazing, good story basically.  
**[0:37:11-0:37:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:37:11):**  It's crazy how consistent it is across all of these different elements of the system.  
**[0:37:18-0:37:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:37:18):**  Just crazy.  
**[0:37:19-0:37:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:37:19):**  Does it make you suspicious as a scientist putting your scientist hat on?  
**[0:37:23-0:37:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:37:23):**  Too good to be true?  
**[0:37:25-0:37:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:37:25):**  No, it makes total sense.  
**[0:37:27-0:37:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:37:27):**  It makes total sense.  
**[0:37:29-0:37:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:37:29):**  This is from an ecological standpoint.  
**[0:37:32-0:37:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:37:32):**  This is the answer to planetary scale problems.  
**[0:37:36-0:37:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:37:36):**  When you walk away from that almond orchard I was talking about and saying to yourself,  
**[0:37:42-0:37:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:37:42):**  you know what?  
**[0:37:43-0:37:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:37:43):**  We can turn this back into a wetland if we strategize this correctly or we can actually  
**[0:37:50-0:37:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:37:50):**  solve climate change and offset all of our carbon emissions in the Central Valley or  
**[0:37:55-0:38:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:37:55):**  of California using the Central Valley.  
**[0:38:00-0:38:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:38:00):**  That's what it suggests now because we see a lot of pushback from certain circles.  
**[0:38:05-0:38:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:38:05):**  I have to mention on this carbon piece, we see a lot of hype, I think as well, which  
**[0:38:11-0:38:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:38:11):**  is I think good to a certain extent because suddenly people realize that there used to  
**[0:38:15-0:38:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:38:15):**  be a lot of carbon in the soil and it could potentially go back.  
**[0:38:18-0:38:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:38:18):**  But also a lot of cowboys standing up, setting up companies, selling very shady credits and  
**[0:38:23-0:38:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:38:23):**  less shady credits and all of that.  
**[0:38:25-0:38:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:38:25):**  What gives you hope on that carbon piece looking at the science and looking at the fields you  
**[0:38:29-0:38:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:38:29):**  visited?  
**[0:38:31-0:38:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:38:31):**  I think it's the only answer to the carbon crisis.  
**[0:38:35-0:38:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:38:35):**  If we make this a dialogue about carbon, then we're losing before we start because we have  
**[0:38:42-0:38:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:38:42):**  to understand that really all carbon is is an artifact of life.  
**[0:38:48-0:38:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:38:48):**  So if we establish an incentivization program that's focused on carbon instead of on promoting  
**[0:38:54-0:38:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:38:54):**  life on a farm, you're going to lose.  
**[0:38:57-0:39:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:38:57):**  There's too many cheaters that are going to move in and try to take advantage of that  
**[0:39:01-0:39:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:39:01):**  system.  
**[0:39:02-0:39:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:39:02):**  And that's what got us into this mess to begin with.  
**[0:39:06-0:39:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:39:06):**  But if you focus those incentive programs on promoting plant and animal life on your  
**[0:39:10-0:39:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:39:10):**  farms or microbial life, you can't lose.  
**[0:39:14-0:39:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:39:14):**  You can't cheat.  
**[0:39:17-0:39:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:39:17):**  Can't cheat with life.  
**[0:39:18-0:39:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:39:18):**  And so how would you shape a system like that?  
**[0:39:20-0:39:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:39:20):**  If somebody says, OK, John, I would give you the power to to shape, let's say, an ecosystem  
**[0:39:27-0:39:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:39:27):**  service, even though the word is horrible, a system where we're going to sell ecosystem  
**[0:39:33-0:39:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:39:33):**  services to others in a forced market like everybody has to.  
**[0:39:38-0:39:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:39:38):**  How would you shape?  
**[0:39:39-0:39:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:39:39):**  What would you measure?  
**[0:39:40-0:39:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:39:40):**  It's going to be reductionist because we cannot measure everything.  
**[0:39:43-0:39:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:39:43):**  We cannot actually measure the complexity of life.  
**[0:39:47-0:39:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:39:47):**  And that's OK, as long as we acknowledge that.  
**[0:39:49-0:39:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:39:49):**  What would you what would be good proxies for you if it's not carbon?  
**[0:39:53-0:40:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:39:53):**  You know, I don't know that that's even a question for us, because what's happening  
**[0:40:00-0:40:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:40:00):**  right now is an evolution of our food system.  
**[0:40:06-0:40:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:40:06):**  Under the current constraints to our society and our planet and our food system, the current  
**[0:40:13-0:40:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:40:13):**  system is going to die.  
**[0:40:16-0:40:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:40:16):**  It's going to implode.  
**[0:40:18-0:40:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:40:18):**  We're so close to it that it's really alarming.  
**[0:40:22-0:40:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:40:22):**  And the only way that we're going to survive is with regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:40:26-0:40:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:40:26):**  And so the regenerative food systems, because of our profit analysis, they don't have to  
**[0:40:31-0:40:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:40:31):**  have incentive programs.  
**[0:40:33-0:40:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:40:33):**  Right.  
**[0:40:34-0:40:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:40:34):**  I mean, if those incentive programs can make it more attractive to change or something  
**[0:40:39-0:40:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:40:39):**  like this or de-risk, like you mentioned before, the transition risk, we could even be in your  
**[0:40:44-0:40:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:40:44):**  hat, obviously.  
**[0:40:45-0:40:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:40:45):**  It doesn't have to be real risk.  
**[0:40:46-0:40:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:40:46):**  But if it's perceived risk.  
**[0:40:49-0:40:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:40:49):**  Perceived risk, right.  
**[0:40:50-0:40:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:40:50):**  And that's fine.  
**[0:40:53-0:40:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:40:53):**  But it's not necessary.  
**[0:40:56-0:41:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:40:56):**  And I think that that's what, yeah, as additional farms fail, the only ones that are going to  
**[0:41:02-0:41:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:41:02):**  be standing are the regenerative ones.  
**[0:41:05-0:41:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:41:05):**  And so, yeah, from our perspective, do you incentivize life or carbon or whatever?  
**[0:41:11-0:41:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:41:11):**  No, I don't think you need to incentivize any of it.  
**[0:41:13-0:41:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:41:13):**  You just need to stop giving incentives to poor practices and remove some of the food  
**[0:41:21-0:41:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:41:21):**  safety issues or laws and things like this that are real hindrances.  
**[0:41:26-0:41:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:41:26):**  Remove crop insurance that are supporting a dead and broken system.  
**[0:41:34-0:41:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:41:34):**  And you mentioned we compare to successful conventional ones.  
**[0:41:38-0:41:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:41:38):**  Do you see even the successful conventional ones struggling or close to the edge or are  
**[0:41:44-0:41:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:41:44):**  let's say the top in the conventional extractive ones are probably the last one standing of  
**[0:41:49-0:41:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:41:49):**  that sector?  
**[0:41:50-0:41:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:41:50):**  Or are they even on the edge or are they looking at transitioning as the almond grower we talked  
**[0:41:55-0:41:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:41:55):**  about before?  
**[0:41:57-0:42:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:41:57):**  Some of them are looking at transitioning and some of them aren't.  
**[0:42:01-0:42:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:42:01):**  And that's always the way with society, right?  
**[0:42:07-0:42:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:42:07):**  Our economic analysis isn't complete.  
**[0:42:09-0:42:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:42:09):**  We don't do whole farm analyses or anything like this.  
**[0:42:13-0:42:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:42:13):**  We focus kind of the ins and outs is almost a checkbook balancing operation for a particular  
**[0:42:18-0:42:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:42:18):**  field operation.  
**[0:42:20-0:42:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:42:20):**  And that tells us the relative profitability in that one snapshot.  
**[0:42:26-0:42:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:42:26):**  What it doesn't reflect is the brittleness of a larger operation.  
**[0:42:34-0:42:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:42:34):**  We had one farmer, a friend of mine say, you know, I am a farmer.  
**[0:42:39-0:42:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:42:39):**  Every year I borrow $800,000 to make $850,000.  
**[0:42:46-0:42:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:42:46):**  And our economic analysis doesn't reflect that.  
**[0:42:51-0:42:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:42:51):**  It doesn't reflect where people are at.  
**[0:42:53-0:43:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:42:53):**  How on earth, if an acre of land is $10,000 an acre, which it is pretty often around our  
**[0:43:04-0:43:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:43:04):**  area and around there, how on earth, even with the best corn prices, would you ever  
**[0:43:12-0:43:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:43:12):**  in your lifetime pay that off?  
**[0:43:15-0:43:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:43:15):**  And our farming community is so overextended on debt and just trying to squeeze out being  
**[0:43:23-0:43:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:43:23):**  able to pay that mortgage in order to keep the chemical companies and the seed companies  
**[0:43:28-0:43:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:43:28):**  and all the other companies that are making money off of them in business.  
**[0:43:36-0:43:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:43:36):**  We're going to break down mentally before we break down economically.  
**[0:43:39-0:43:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:43:39):**  But I have a feeling both of those things are already happening.  
**[0:43:43-0:43:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:43:43):**  And so what will happen?  
**[0:43:44-0:43:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:43:44):**  Will they collapse or one on one?  
**[0:43:46-0:43:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:43:46):**  And then will the land prices collapse as well and give access to a whole new generation  
**[0:43:53-0:43:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:43:53):**  or will they stay high and will the largest one surviving that still has an OK relationship  
**[0:43:57-0:44:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:43:57):**  with the bank, buy the neighbor and keep getting bigger until it holds?  
**[0:44:02-0:44:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:44:02):**  What is needed?  
**[0:44:03-0:44:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:44:03):**  Do prices need to come down at some point to reflect the real carrying capacity?  
**[0:44:07-0:44:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:44:07):**  Yeah, I think that that's going to happen.  
**[0:44:10-0:44:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:44:10):**  Right now, you end up seeing corporate ownership and investment firms buying land and inflating  
**[0:44:17-0:44:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:44:17):**  prices, land prices, keeping them inflated.  
**[0:44:22-0:44:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:44:22):**  You see more elderly farmers that have some equity reinvesting that equity back into land,  
**[0:44:30-0:44:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:44:30):**  but not being able to really pay that.  
**[0:44:34-0:44:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:44:34):**  And so the land prices are artificially swollen and that bubble continues to swell.  
**[0:44:40-0:44:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:44:40):**  It will burst and it's going to be painful to watch.  
**[0:44:44-0:44:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:44:44):**  But we're real close to that right now.  
**[0:44:47-0:44:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:44:47):**  And when that happens, you know, there is a lot of young farmers that are interested  
**[0:44:53-0:44:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:44:53):**  in coming in.  
**[0:44:54-0:45:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:44:54):**  And it turns out you don't need 190 million acres to produce food to pay our to feed our  
**[0:45:02-0:45:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:45:02):**  society.  
**[0:45:03-0:45:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:45:03):**  You don't need that much land.  
**[0:45:06-0:45:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:45:06):**  If you're a girl food instead of feed.  
**[0:45:11-0:45:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:45:11):**  And so what are you hoping to establish this year with 500 farms to start a bigger debate  
**[0:45:22-0:45:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:45:22):**  on this crop insurance, on the subsidies, on the land prices in general, or just to  
**[0:45:29-0:45:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:45:29):**  publish these results and then hope it sticks somewhere?  
**[0:45:34-0:45:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:45:34):**  What are you going to do with the results even this year?  
**[0:45:38-0:45:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:45:38):**  You know, at the end of this year, we'll have a pretty darn good systems level assessments,  
**[0:45:47-0:45:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:45:47):**  including economics on, I don't know, three, four hundred established contrasts around  
**[0:45:55-0:45:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:45:55):**  the US.  
**[0:45:56-0:46:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:45:56):**  Plus like a control group next to it in most cases.  
**[0:46:00-0:46:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:46:00):**  Yeah.  
**[0:46:01-0:46:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:46:01):**  So I mean, that's a pretty good sample size to make some assertions, multi geographies,  
**[0:46:09-0:46:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:46:09):**  multi food systems, orchards, cash grains, vegetables, all of these sorts of things to  
**[0:46:15-0:46:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:46:15):**  kind of say, OK, here's the big punch, right?  
**[0:46:20-0:46:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:46:20):**  Here's the big punch of does this work?  
**[0:46:22-0:46:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:46:22):**  Yeah, I'm sorry, but it does.  
**[0:46:25-0:46:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:46:25):**  And I'm not sorry, actually.  
**[0:46:27-0:46:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:46:27):**  It should.  
**[0:46:28-0:46:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:46:28):**  This is the answer to a lot of things.  
**[0:46:30-0:46:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:46:30):**  And so the data is it's going to support that.  
**[0:46:34-0:46:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:46:34):**  I mean, that's based on our previous experience, not my ideology.  
**[0:46:40-0:46:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:46:40):**  Whether you're traditional colleagues in like the university world or in the traditional  
**[0:46:45-0:46:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:46:45):**  ag, not even traditional, let's say the rest of the ag industry research community, has  
**[0:46:54-0:46:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:46:54):**  that changed their approach to you and your work in general?  
**[0:46:58-0:47:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:46:58):**  Of course, at the foundation of the last years, has it been more collaborative or is it really  
**[0:47:03-0:47:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:47:03):**  like, do they start to see the potential of this as more research keeps coming out telling  
**[0:47:09-0:47:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:47:09):**  the same story?  
**[0:47:10-0:47:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:47:10):**  Like, look, it works.  
**[0:47:11-0:47:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:47:11):**  There's a lot of potential.  
**[0:47:12-0:47:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:47:12):**  Like, let's not let's not keep ignoring it.  
**[0:47:17-0:47:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:47:17):**  Have you seen a shift in the scientific world around this type of work?  
**[0:47:22-0:47:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:47:22):**  Yeah, I think that, well, you've seen a lot of, there's a lot of greenwashing too.  
**[0:47:31-0:47:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:47:31):**  And so you see university departments that, you know, open up some, they see this as a  
**[0:47:37-0:47:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:47:37):**  cash cow.  
**[0:47:38-0:47:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:47:38):**  And so they end up forging departments and regenerative systems and all this other things,  
**[0:47:45-0:47:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:47:45):**  but they don't really understand what's needed here.  
**[0:47:50-0:47:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:47:50):**  The style of science that ICTISIS does, which is driven by farmers and on farm and multi  
**[0:47:55-0:48:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:47:55):**  geography, multi food systems, you know, we can cross a lot of barriers that other institutions  
**[0:48:04-0:48:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:48:04):**  are constrained by, opens up a lot of opportunities for us to kind of shape the scientific community.  
**[0:48:12-0:48:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:48:12):**  When we got into almonds, nobody was working on regenerative almond production.  
**[0:48:17-0:48:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:48:17):**  They weren't thinking about small components.  
**[0:48:20-0:48:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:48:20):**  By the time we are this year, I mean, there's four, at least four regenerative almond research  
**[0:48:28-0:48:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:48:28):**  operations that are going on or projects that are going on.  
**[0:48:33-0:48:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:48:33):**  And so the other research institutions do fall in line.  
**[0:48:39-0:48:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:48:39):**  It just takes somebody to show them what it's done.  
**[0:48:42-0:48:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:48:42):**  And that's kind of our role at ICTISIS.  
**[0:48:45-0:48:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:48:45):**  Our new slogan is we're the pebble that starts the avalanche.  
**[0:48:49-0:48:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:48:49):**  And the rest of the world, like what have you seen beyond the US, beyond North America?  
**[0:48:56-0:48:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:48:56):**  Are you in touch with other institutions that are doing similar work?  
**[0:48:59-0:49:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:48:59):**  Like what is your, if you have a view, your view on beyond the borders or across the ocean  
**[0:49:04-0:49:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:49:04):**  or across to the south, to the east, to the west, et cetera.  
**[0:49:07-0:49:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:49:07):**  What have you seen there?  
**[0:49:09-0:49:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:49:09):**  Have you been in touch with many or not?  
**[0:49:11-0:49:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:49:11):**  What has been your connection to the rest of the world?  
**[0:49:15-0:49:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:49:15):**  I think it's a similar situation around the world as we have in the United States.  
**[0:49:20-0:49:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:49:20):**  This movement is not being led by the research community or the scientific community or the  
**[0:49:25-0:49:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:49:25):**  governments.  
**[0:49:27-0:49:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:49:27):**  This movement is being led by farmers.  
**[0:49:30-0:49:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:49:30):**  And there's extremely successful farming operations that are regenerative in every habitat that  
**[0:49:38-0:49:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:49:38):**  you visit.  
**[0:49:40-0:49:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:49:40):**  Even in the United States, that's been an interesting thing.  
**[0:49:44-0:49:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:49:44):**  When we started Thousand Farms, we posted a database where people could register their  
**[0:49:48-0:49:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:49:48):**  farm.  
**[0:49:49-0:49:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:49:49):**  And within a couple of weeks, we had almost 900 some farms that were registered from the  
**[0:49:57-0:50:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:49:57):**  United States and even some from outside of our borders.  
**[0:50:01-0:50:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:50:01):**  You know what that means?  
**[0:50:02-0:50:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:50:02):**  I mean, if in a typical crowdfunding situation or something, if you get 10% of people to  
**[0:50:09-0:50:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:50:09):**  click on the link and of those 10% to actually do something like register themselves or something  
**[0:50:15-0:50:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:50:15):**  like that, that's pretty good response rate.  
**[0:50:18-0:50:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:50:18):**  So you're suggesting there's 100x.  
**[0:50:21-0:50:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:50:21):**  There's thousands of regenerative farms just in the United States alone that are operating  
**[0:50:28-0:50:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:50:28):**  under the radar screen that are not being served by anybody in terms of science or policies  
**[0:50:34-0:50:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:50:34):**  or anything like that.  
**[0:50:36-0:50:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:50:36):**  There's a lot going on.  
**[0:50:38-0:50:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:50:38):**  And maybe one of our jobs is to help highlight that.  
**[0:50:42-0:50:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:50:42):**  So how can people get involved?  
**[0:50:44-0:50:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:50:44):**  What do you need to make this 1000 potentially much more farm initiative an even bigger success?  
**[0:50:56-0:51:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:50:56):**  If you have a farm that you're interested in getting involved in this, we're looking  
**[0:51:02-0:51:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:51:02):**  for the leaders in regenerative and those folks that are trying to transition.  
**[0:51:06-0:51:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:51:06):**  So if they're just in their infancy, we want them to register.  
**[0:51:09-0:51:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:51:09):**  It takes about two minutes.  
**[0:51:10-0:51:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:51:10):**  Go to the ichthysis.bio website.  
**[0:51:12-0:51:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:51:12):**  You'll see the link.  
**[0:51:14-0:51:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:51:14):**  Really doesn't take any time.  
**[0:51:15-0:51:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:51:15):**  Doesn't hurt you a bit.  
**[0:51:17-0:51:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:51:17):**  That's the first step.  
**[0:51:19-0:51:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:51:19):**  It costs us about $7,500 per field to do this analysis and we're trying to keep it free  
**[0:51:24-0:51:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:51:24):**  for the farmers.  
**[0:51:26-0:51:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:51:26):**  So if there's philanthropic opportunities or grant opportunities that can help to sponsor  
**[0:51:31-0:51:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:51:31):**  farms, this is going to be one of the most powerful research experiments in human history,  
**[0:51:39-0:51:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:51:39):**  I think.  
**[0:51:40-0:51:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:51:40):**  I truly believe that.  
**[0:51:42-0:51:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:51:42):**  And so please help support that.  
**[0:51:45-0:51:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:51:45):**  We can really use the help.  
**[0:51:48-0:51:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:51:48):**  Get this involved with your networks.  
**[0:51:50-0:51:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:51:50):**  Help coordinate clusters of farms because that's how we keep the price down is by having  
**[0:51:56-0:51:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:51:56):**  clusters.  
**[0:51:57-0:52:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:51:57):**  We can't go out into the middle of nowhere in Nebraska and have one farm, right?  
**[0:52:01-0:52:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:52:01):**  We have to try to strategize this a little bit.  
**[0:52:05-0:52:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:52:05):**  So definitely get in touch or put the links below as well if you want to be on the research  
**[0:52:10-0:52:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:52:10):**  side and if you want to, obviously, if you have a foundation and a grant capacity, anything  
**[0:52:15-0:52:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:52:15):**  helps in this case, but especially if you have larger capacity, it would help if you  
**[0:52:20-0:52:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:52:20):**  get involved.  
**[0:52:22-0:52:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:52:22):**  And I think with that, what is, you mentioned a lot of research that's coming out over the  
**[0:52:26-0:52:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:52:26):**  next years.  
**[0:52:27-0:52:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:52:27):**  I'm thinking, what are you most excited about that's coming, say, in the next months?  
**[0:52:33-0:52:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:52:33):**  What are you busy with now?  
**[0:52:34-0:52:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:52:34):**  Is there anything that's almost ready to be released just to finish up this conversation?  
**[0:52:40-0:52:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:52:40):**  It's not the last one we'll have, I'm pretty sure on that, but just to end with, or an  
**[0:52:45-0:52:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:52:45):**  interesting surprise over the last weeks in research or in farm visits you've done.  
**[0:52:50-0:52:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:52:50):**  What is the first thing that comes in mind, the first story that you would like to end  
**[0:52:53-0:52:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:52:53):**  this with?  
**[0:52:54-0:52:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:52:54):**  Yeah, there's two things.  
**[0:52:56-0:53:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:52:56):**  The one is that we have a couple of three-year transition stories that are starting to come  
**[0:53:01-0:53:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:53:01):**  out because we've been monitoring the same farms up in Canada and down in Kansas and  
**[0:53:06-0:53:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:53:06):**  the rate of changes and magnitude of change that we've seen in just one year is pretty  
**[0:53:14-0:53:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:53:14):**  profound.  
**[0:53:15-0:53:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:53:15):**  So this isn't going to be as risky as we thought it was.  
**[0:53:19-0:53:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:53:19):**  And they'll come out as case studies or as research?  
**[0:53:22-0:53:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:53:22):**  Yeah, we'll be publishing those.  
**[0:53:24-0:53:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:53:24):**  We'll be submitting those within the next couple of months.  
**[0:53:28-0:53:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:53:28):**  And then looking at birds as well as invertebrates and things and how those change in relation  
**[0:53:35-0:53:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:53:35):**  to soil quality and all those other wonderful things.  
**[0:53:40-0:53:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:53:40):**  And then the other thing is, this Thousand Farms Initiative is exposing us, like getting  
**[0:53:48-0:53:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:53:48):**  our hands dirty on just about every food system in every region on a continent.  
**[0:53:57-0:54:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:53:57):**  And the stories that are involved there really get me excited about sharing the success stories  
**[0:54:04-0:54:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:54:04):**  of these farmers, but in the personal stories of the people that are really making a change.  
**[0:54:10-0:54:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:54:10):**  So we're exposing ourselves to our food system and an intimacy and scale that has never been,  
**[0:54:17-0:54:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:54:17):**  I don't think anybody else has that.  
**[0:54:21-0:54:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:54:21):**  But then also, we're studying this at a key pivotal point in human history of the evolution  
**[0:54:28-0:54:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:54:28):**  of our food system and a real change.  
**[0:54:31-0:54:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:54:31):**  And so I think that telling that story is going to be really fun for us.  
**[0:54:35-0:54:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:54:35):**  And probably a key point, and I wouldn't say even in human evolution as well or the Earth  
**[0:54:41-0:54:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:54:41):**  evolution, not just the food system, this touches, as we mentioned at the beginning,  
**[0:54:46-0:54:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:54:46):**  absolutely everything.  
**[0:54:48-0:54:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:54:48):**  And we have to slow down and we have to start somewhere with food problem.  
**[0:54:51-0:54:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:54:51):**  Yeah, I think it's a really good way of starting.  
**[0:54:56-0:54:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:54:56):**  And with that, I want to thank you so much for your time.  
**[0:54:58-0:55:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:54:58):**  Be conscious of your time as well.  
**[0:55:00-0:55:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:55:00):**  And thank you for sharing this morning and hopefully a lot of interesting case studies,  
**[0:55:05-0:55:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:55:05):**  a lot of interesting stories backed by science, backed by non reductionist science to give  
**[0:55:12-0:55:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:55:12):**  wings to this movement and this transition.  
**[0:55:14-0:55:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:55:14):**  Thank you so much for of course, the work you do and coming on here for the second time

**[0:56:07-0:56:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:56:07):**  Dear friends of the podcast, I'm super excited to share with you the online video course  
**[0:56:11-0:56:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:56:11):**  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[0:56:15-0:56:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:56:15):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  
**[0:56:19-0:56:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:56:19):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[0:56:21-0:56:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:56:21):**  After 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question how to put money  
**[0:56:25-0:56:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:56:25):**  to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011 and recording  
**[0:56:30-0:56:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:56:30):**  this podcast since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  
**[0:56:35-0:56:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:56:35):**  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  
**[0:56:37-0:56:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:56:37):**  How have we built our decision making framework?  
**[0:56:40-0:56:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:56:40):**  What to focus on with the podcast?  
**[0:56:42-0:56:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:56:42):**  How have we picked interviewees?

**[0:56:47-0:56:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:56:47):**  What should you read?  
**[0:56:48-0:56:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:56:48):**  What should you listen?  
**[0:56:50-0:56:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:56:50):**  What should you watch?  
**[0:56:51-0:56:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:56:51):**  How to approach this space?  
**[0:56:54-0:56:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:56:54):**  For whom is this course?  
**[0:56:55-0:56:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:56:55):**  You, the soil builders and investors in the space.  
**[0:56:58-0:57:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:56:58):**  The soil builders, people working in this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers,  
**[0:57:02-0:57:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:57:02):**  vehicle builders, crowd investing, platform builders, ag tech companies, farm to gut food  
**[0:57:07-0:57:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:57:07):**  companies, permaculture, key line designers, holistic management, consultants, etc.  
**[0:57:12-0:57:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:57:12):**  People that are building soil at scale.  
**[0:57:15-0:57:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:57:15):**  And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office  
**[0:57:18-0:57:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:57:18):**  or as private individuals or people who are putting other people's money to work through  
**[0:57:23-0:57:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:57:23):**  foundations, institutional capital, banks, insurance companies, etc.  
**[0:57:27-0:57:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:57:27):**  Is this course free?  
**[0:57:28-0:57:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:57:28):**  No.  
**[0:57:29-0:57:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:57:29):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:57:32-0:57:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:57:32):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.  
**[0:57:36-0:57:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:57:36):**  And I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very  
**[0:57:40-0:57:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:57:40):**  different means.  
**[0:57:41-0:57:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:57:41):**  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you, and if you have the means to  
**[0:57:47-0:57:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:57:47):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[0:57:49-0:57:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:57:49):**  Thank you.  
**[0:57:50-0:57:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:57:50):**  So what is this course?  
**[0:57:52-0:57:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:57:52):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  
**[0:57:58-0:58:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:57:58):**  so you don't have to write along.  
**[0:58:00-0:58:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:58:00):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:58:05-0:58:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:58:05):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:58:10-0:58:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:58:10):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find, or what kind of investors you could  
**[0:58:15-0:58:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:58:15):**  find if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:58:17-0:58:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:58:17):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:58:22-0:58:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:58:22):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:58:25-0:58:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:58:25):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design, and a lot more.  
**[0:58:30-0:58:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:58:30):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:58:31-0:58:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:58:31):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:58:33-0:58:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:58:33):**  Unfortunately, that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:58:36-0:58:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:58:36):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:58:39-0:58:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:58:39):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:58:41-0:58:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:58:41):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.  
**[0:58:46-0:58:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jonathan-lundgren-2#t=0:58:46):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea, or whatever you're drinking.

**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:00:14):**  What is Regeneg and is there a label for it?  
**[0:00:16-0:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:00:16):**  This is a question I get all the time.  
**[0:00:19-0:00:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:00:19):**  Immediately followed by why do we need another certification or label as many people have  
**[0:00:23-0:00:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:00:23):**  rightfully so label fatigue and there's hardly any space left on packaging.  
**[0:00:28-0:00:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:00:28):**  From dolphin friendly to kosher, vegan, rainforest friendly, grass-fed, conservation agriculture,  
**[0:00:33-0:00:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:00:33):**  bird friendly, etc.  
**[0:00:35-0:00:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:00:35):**  This conversation dives deep into the why and how of creating the gold standard of Regen  
**[0:00:40-0:00:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:00:40):**  certification.  
**[0:00:43-0:00:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:00:43):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture.  
**[0:00:47-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:00:47):**  Investing as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:49-0:00:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:00:49):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:53-0:00:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:00:53):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:00:59-0:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:00:59):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:01:03):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:05-0:01:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:01:05):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:09-0:01:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:01:09):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:12-0:01:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:01:12):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:17-0:01:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:01:17):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:21-0:01:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:01:21):**  In March last year, we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support

**[0:01:47-0:01:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:01:47):**  Welcome to another episode today with Elizabeth Wivlow.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:01:51):**  Executive director of the Regenerative Organic Alliance who are building the Regenerative  
**[0:01:55-0:01:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:01:55):**  Organic certified program.  
**[0:01:56-0:01:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:01:56):**  I'm very excited for this interview.  
**[0:01:58-0:01:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:01:58):**  So welcome, Elizabeth.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:01:59):**  Thank you.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:02:00):**  I am excited and honored to be here.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:02:02):**  Thanks for inviting me.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:02:03):**  We've had an array of amazing guests.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:02:06):**  Appreciate that you want to talk to us.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:02:08):**  And we're following that with today.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:02:09):**  I think a lot of people have questions on certification in general and why do we need  
**[0:02:14-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:02:14):**  it or why don't we need it.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:02:15):**  And it's definitely the work you're doing is creating a lot of that.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:02:19):**  And I think it's a huge lift.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:02:20):**  I'm very excited to dive deeper into it.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:02:23):**  But I want to start with a personal question.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:02:25):**  What brings you to soil?  
**[0:02:26-0:02:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:02:26):**  Gosh, what brings me to soil has been 25 plus years of working with farmers and working  
**[0:02:33-0:02:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:02:33):**  in farming and coming to this point in my career just two years ago when I was offered  
**[0:02:40-0:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:02:40):**  this position to be the director here at the R.O.A.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:02:44):**  A lot of learning around what I already probably knew inherently around organic farming and  
**[0:02:50-0:02:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:02:50):**  all the methods that I had seen farmers practicing over the years.  
**[0:02:54-0:03:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:02:54):**  But I think in the last two years, three years, the whole world has been riveted by this topic  
**[0:03:01-0:03:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:03:01):**  that wasn't so sexy or even really that deeply talked about, except maybe our NRC has or  
**[0:03:07-0:03:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:03:07):**  among soil scientists.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:03:09):**  But soil, it's so amazing.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:03:12):**  And that quote that I use a lot, I think a lot of people are really inspired by this  
**[0:03:17-0:03:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:03:17):**  concept that there are more living beings in one teaspoon of soil than there are humans  
**[0:03:22-0:03:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:03:22):**  on the planet.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:03:23):**  I mean, you can go so many directions with that.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:03:26):**  So that alone is just like the most inspiring and exciting concept.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:03:31):**  And so we start there.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:03:33):**  We start with that and this fascination with what is going on in the soil microbiome and  
**[0:03:38-0:03:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:03:38):**  this incredibly fast moving emergent science around it is also super fascinating.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:03:45):**  We've only identified 15 or 20 percent of the organisms in that microbiome.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:03:50):**  And so we have a long way to go.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:03:52):**  And just what we've learned with that tiny fraction that we've identified and the important  
**[0:03:55-0:04:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:03:55):**  role they play in moving nutrients and cycling soil and moving nutrients to plant roots and  
**[0:04:01-0:04:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:04:01):**  the effects that it has on those plants and the foods that grow from that healthier soil  
**[0:04:05-0:04:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:04:05):**  is pretty staggering.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:04:07):**  So that's why soil.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:04:09):**  And just for anybody that that's listening and thinking, what is the ROA?  
**[0:04:13-0:04:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:04:13):**  What is the alliance?  
**[0:04:14-0:04:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:04:14):**  And then obviously we're going to dive into the certification program you're building  
**[0:04:17-0:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:04:17):**  and have launched.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:04:18):**  Yeah.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:04:19):**  Thanks.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:04:20):**  The ROA is the Regenerative Organic Alliance.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:04:25):**  And it was founded by a group of stakeholders, longtime advocates and pioneers in the organic  
**[0:04:32-0:04:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:04:32):**  sector, Rodale Institute.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:04:34):**  And they do a lot of research around.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:04:36):**  They've been doing research and trials in organics for 40 plus years.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:04:40):**  And they came together with the founders Patagonia Company and Dr. Bronner's.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:04:47):**  And they all looked at what was happening in organic and felt like, gosh, you know,  
**[0:04:51-0:04:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:04:51):**  they had some concerns about the direction that organic was going and what they saw as  
**[0:04:55-0:04:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:04:55):**  a weakening of the organic standard.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:04:57):**  And they wanted to essentially put a stake in the ground to keep organic strong because  
**[0:05:01-0:05:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:05:01):**  it composed a huge portion of their supply chains.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:05:06):**  It also had this vision for a future of agriculture that included more than just like what you  
**[0:05:10-0:05:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:05:10):**  can't use and can use on the farm, but rather have this certification that would focus on  
**[0:05:17-0:05:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:05:17):**  three main pillars.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:05:20):**  So the ROA exists to create the highest standard for regenerative organic in the world.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:05:26):**  And that is based on these three pillars.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:05:27):**  And one is soil health.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:05:29):**  The other is animal welfare.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:05:31):**  And the third is the human component, that social fairness or fairness to farmers and  
**[0:05:37-0:05:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:05:37):**  farm workers.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:05:38):**  So those are the three pillars that we stand on.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:05:40):**  So it's fair to say that they came together to take organic to the next level, but you  
**[0:05:45-0:05:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:05:45):**  also mentioned concerns with the current organic standards.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:05:48):**  So what were or are some of those concerns?  
**[0:05:50-0:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:05:50):**  Well, I mean, the one that many people were talking about at the time when that group  
**[0:05:54-0:06:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:05:54):**  came together at the Rodeo Institute in late 2017, it was just on the cusp of the National  
**[0:06:00-0:06:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:06:00):**  Organic Standards Board recommendation to the National Organic Program in the US that  
**[0:06:07-0:06:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:06:07):**  they allow hydroponics or soilless production.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:06:11):**  And there was a real serious division within the organic sector and the folks advocating  
**[0:06:17-0:06:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:06:17):**  for the fact that organic farming needs to happen in the soil, in the earth, and not  
**[0:06:22-0:06:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:06:22):**  in a pot, a plastic pot that has imported soil medium with imported fertility products,  
**[0:06:30-0:06:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:06:30):**  and in many cases, reappropriated water.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:06:32):**  So that was one of the main concerns.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:06:34):**  The other, and then the NOSB did vote, it was a very tied, it was eight to seven in  
**[0:06:40-0:06:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:06:40):**  favor of allowing hydroponics and has since caused great ripples in the sector over here.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:06:46):**  And so our program does not allow any hydroponic farming.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:06:51):**  I mean, certainly farmers can start in pots, but no harvesting like fruit or crops from  
**[0:06:56-0:06:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:06:56):**  the pot, essentially.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:06:58):**  The other part that was a real concern was factory farming of animals, this industrialization  
**[0:07:04-0:07:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:07:04):**  of organic livestock operations and the NLP and tried, there was this pasture rule, I'm  
**[0:07:13-0:07:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:07:13):**  not sure if you're familiar with that and I won't get into the details of that because  
**[0:07:16-0:07:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:07:16):**  we could talk about that for the whole hour, but we won't.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:07:20):**  We will focus instead on the fact that what was happening in organic livestock was this  
**[0:07:25-0:07:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:07:25):**  proliferation of extremely large scale operations where you have 10,000 milk cows gathered in  
**[0:07:31-0:07:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:07:31):**  one place or where especially pregnant at the time was the, is still, is the laying  
**[0:07:39-0:07:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:07:39):**  operations for the organic eggs and broiler operations for organic chicken, where these  
**[0:07:45-0:07:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:07:45):**  were large scale operations, 50,000, 100,000 birds in a house and not having any access  
**[0:07:54-0:07:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:07:54):**  to the outdoors.  
**[0:07:56-0:07:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:07:56):**  Which was and is allowed according to organic certification.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:07:59):**  Yes, it was being allowed.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:08:01):**  There was some gray areas in the rule.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:08:04):**  There was an animal welfare task force of which our founding chair of our board, Jeff  
**[0:08:08-0:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:08:08):**  Moyer from the Rodeo Institute was part of this.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:08:12):**  Other folks who worked with us during our pilot were also on the animal welfare task  
**[0:08:16-0:08:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:08:16):**  force.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:08:17):**  They worked for years to get agreement from the industry, from the farmers, from everybody  
**[0:08:23-0:08:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:08:23):**  and they finally made recommendations for improving the animal welfare standards.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:08:27):**  The NOP put it, it was put into effect, but then the Trump administration within weeks  
**[0:08:32-0:08:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:08:32):**  of stepping into office, Trump had basically eviscerated that and removed that from the  
**[0:08:37-0:08:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:08:37):**  NOP.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:08:38):**  So now we were back to square one on that.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:08:40):**  So really just seeing this need to have livestock operations that really focus on access to  
**[0:08:46-0:08:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:08:46):**  the outdoors.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:08:47):**  That all triggered the realization of we need an add on or we need a layer on top of the  
**[0:08:54-0:08:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:08:54):**  current organic system.  
**[0:08:56-0:08:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:08:56):**  Exactly.  
**[0:08:57-0:08:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:08:57):**  Yeah.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:08:58):**  And, you know, one other really important thing, especially now in this, what we've  
**[0:09:02-0:09:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:09:02):**  all learned in the last year with COVID and the vulnerability of those workers on the  
**[0:09:07-0:09:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:09:07):**  front line is that there were no provisions to take care of the people, the farmers or  
**[0:09:12-0:09:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:09:12):**  the farm workers.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:09:14):**  And so really what the ROA set out to do is really high bar, really ambitious and aspirational  
**[0:09:21-0:09:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:09:21):**  to no end.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:09:23):**  And we've learned a lot during the last year, two years.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:09:26):**  We completed our pilot last year in January and have since been revising the framework  
**[0:09:32-0:09:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:09:32):**  that originally came out as the ROC framework and the standards.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:09:38):**  So we've done significant revisions and work on those with the input from all of the stakeholders  
**[0:09:42-0:09:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:09:42):**  and very participatory process with every one of our pilot participants, giving us lots  
**[0:09:48-0:09:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:09:48):**  of detailed feedback on how that framework worked or didn't work in their setting, as  
**[0:09:53-0:09:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:09:53):**  well as working with the four different certifiers who we approved and onboarded to do this work  
**[0:09:59-0:10:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:09:59):**  with us and then all of their auditors.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:10:02):**  So we got a lot of great feedback and it took, you know, it was a, we had four different  
**[0:10:07-0:10:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:10:07):**  task forces working to digest and deliberate all that feedback and then make their recommendation  
**[0:10:12-0:10:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:10:12):**  to our board.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:10:13):**  And then the board had to come to agreement as well.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:10:16):**  And then we were able to make these changes to the framework.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:10:19):**  So we're now beginning 2021.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:10:22):**  Where do you stand?  
**[0:10:23-0:10:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:10:23):**  Oh my gosh, we're busy.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:10:24):**  We have probably, we have nearly, I think 60 applicants in there right now in the queue.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:10:30):**  And applicants are farms or food companies?  
**[0:10:33-0:10:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:10:33):**  What do I, what should I envision when you say applicants?  
**[0:10:37-0:10:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:10:37):**  So we are a farm level certification.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:10:40):**  I think the real important concept to behind the ROC is that it will be brand driven.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:10:47):**  Brands are going to build this and support this because number one, they pay more, they  
**[0:10:51-0:10:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:10:51):**  pay twice as much as farmers and we have our fee scale set quite low to help onboard more  
**[0:10:55-0:10:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:10:55):**  and more farmers.  
**[0:10:56-0:11:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:10:56):**  It's at 0.1%.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:11:00):**  So it's like their gross regenerative organic crop value, the fees are quite low.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:11:05):**  Brands pay twice that.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:11:07):**  So first off, you know, the brands will drive this with their adoption of it and by having  
**[0:11:11-0:11:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:11:11):**  this consumer facing logo on package.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:11:15):**  But who's applying are farms only.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:11:17):**  We will license the brands to purchase this ROC product that it gets certified at the  
**[0:11:22-0:11:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:11:22):**  farm level.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:11:24):**  And right now the farmers, we have applications from all over the world.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:11:28):**  We have very large grower groups of cacao farmers, coffee farmers, cotton, sugar.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:11:35):**  We have a huge mix.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:11:36):**  We have laying operations in the US and grain operations coming in, tropical fruits in Central  
**[0:11:43-0:11:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:11:43):**  America, mixed veggies in Mexico.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:11:48):**  It's been all over the place.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:11:50):**  It's really exciting and overwhelming, I have to say.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:11:52):**  But yeah, we're fine.  
**[0:11:53-0:11:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:11:53):**  We're in a really good position.  
**[0:11:54-0:11:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:11:54):**  We've worked so hard the last few months.  
**[0:11:56-0:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:11:56):**  I've been able to assemble this stellar team here and for the first year it was me primarily  
**[0:12:03-0:12:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:12:03):**  with NSF International and we contracted with them as our program manager and they provided  
**[0:12:08-0:12:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:12:08):**  really awesome support and many people from different departments or divisions who helped  
**[0:12:13-0:12:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:12:13):**  us launch the pilot program and then oversaw the whole kind of feedback process.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:12:19):**  And then at that point when we concluded all that process, I hired on a quality manager  
**[0:12:26-0:12:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:12:26):**  for the ROA who is going to, basically we're taking that all internal.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:12:30):**  The ROA is a scheme owner.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:12:33):**  We own this term that we have the mark with apply for the trademarks.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:12:36):**  We own the term regenerative organic certified and as the scheme owner, we also are now going  
**[0:12:43-0:12:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:12:43):**  to be the scheme manager by hiring on a quality manager and developing our systems completely  
**[0:12:48-0:12:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:12:48):**  in accordance with ISO standards that any robust certifier or certification will follow.  
**[0:12:55-0:12:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:12:55):**  And in the coming year or so, we will get accredited under one of those international  
**[0:12:59-0:13:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:12:59):**  organizations, either ISO or ISEAL or something along those lines, just so that everybody  
**[0:13:04-0:13:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:13:04):**  knows that we've got this really excellent kind of systematic way of making decisions  
**[0:13:11-0:13:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:13:11):**  and everything is done according to those international standards for conformity assessment,  
**[0:13:17-0:13:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:13:17):**  what they call for certification.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:13:18):**  And what do you say to people that are saying, well, why do we need another certification?  
**[0:13:22-0:13:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:13:22):**  We have so many logos already on the packaging of some of the brands you mentioned have their  
**[0:13:28-0:13:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:13:28):**  packaging full of logos.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:13:30):**  But what do you say to that general response that I hear a lot about, why is Regen not  
**[0:13:36-0:13:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:13:36):**  certifiable?  
**[0:13:37-0:13:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:13:37):**  And I said, actually, people are working on that.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:13:38):**  And then immediately the response from other people is, oh, another logo, another certification.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:13:43):**  What is your go to answer when somebody brings that up?  
**[0:13:45-0:13:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:13:45):**  I get it.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:13:46):**  I mean, I worked in organics for 20 years and then I was in animal welfare for a couple  
**[0:13:51-0:13:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:13:51):**  years and there is a proliferation of labels and no real estate left on a package.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:13:58):**  And I completely empathize with everybody from every level of farmer, the brand and  
**[0:14:04-0:14:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:14:04):**  the consumer.  
**[0:14:05-0:14:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:14:05):**  But it doesn't mean that we shouldn't set out to create this label that will equate  
**[0:14:10-0:14:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:14:10):**  to the highest label you can get that will speak to all your values.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:14:14):**  That's the intention of the ROA is that this label will really address all those different  
**[0:14:19-0:14:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:14:19):**  concerns that people bring to their, you know, when they go shopping for their food, fiber  
**[0:14:25-0:14:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:14:25):**  or body care products.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:14:28):**  So it's important to have an offering out there that is super high bar and addresses  
**[0:14:33-0:14:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:14:33):**  all those needs.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:14:34):**  And, you know, a lot of folks are concerned about the organic label and where there was  
**[0:14:38-0:14:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:14:38):**  a kind of waning of confidence in what that meant.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:14:43):**  There's the non GMO project has been hugely successful, but how meaningful is it when  
**[0:14:48-0:14:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:14:48):**  you have a non GMO label on something that like water or a product that has, there is  
**[0:14:55-0:15:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:14:55):**  no GMO that you need to worry about, but yet we've got this non GMO label on it.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:15:00):**  So I think just having a really meaningful label with credibility is important.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:15:04):**  And in the coming years, we'll be doing a lot more kind of consumer education around  
**[0:15:10-0:15:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:15:10):**  that right now.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:15:11):**  The main focus is on the certification.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:15:12):**  That's like strict focus for me and keeping the team focused on that is, you know, developing  
**[0:15:17-0:15:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:15:17):**  a really rigorous certification program that we can be proud of.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:15:22):**  And we're not going to get like accusations of having a watered down kind of program by  
**[0:15:29-0:15:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:15:29):**  any stretch.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:15:30):**  And that's a risk out there with some of those claims and some of those labels is there's  
**[0:15:33-0:15:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:15:33):**  not a lot of integrity behind them.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:15:36):**  And in terms of like, let's say the end of this year, what would you consider success?  
**[0:15:40-0:15:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:15:40):**  Like, do you have a target in the amount of products or the amount of certified farms?  
**[0:15:45-0:15:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:15:45):**  What are you looking forward in the next 12 months as we are at the beginning of the year?  
**[0:15:49-0:15:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:15:49):**  I would, you know, I really love to measure it by the acreage or hectares that we convert.  
**[0:15:56-0:16:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:15:56):**  That's where we're going to see the most improvements, of course, and then how many workers and farmers  
**[0:16:00-0:16:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:16:00):**  we help.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:16:01):**  We are looking at different KPIs as we go out and do these audits.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:16:05):**  And so we are collecting this data and trying to figure out what is the best way to measure  
**[0:16:09-0:16:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:16:09):**  the success.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:16:10):**  But for me, looking at the amount of land that we convert to this method, the amount  
**[0:16:16-0:16:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:16:16):**  of farm animals that we will impact by creating more conditions that honor those animals needs  
**[0:16:23-0:16:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:16:23):**  to express their natural behaviors and be out on pasture and so forth.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:16:28):**  And I really like to experiment.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:16:30):**  I'm very always very interested in decision making frameworks.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:16:33):**  And I like to use the ITN, which is important, structability and neglectiveness framework,  
**[0:16:39-0:16:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:16:39):**  which comes from the Effective Altruism movement.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:16:41):**  They have a number of other frameworks.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:16:42):**  And actually, I should do a webinar soon about frameworks.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:16:46):**  But that's another that's for another time.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:16:48):**  But it's I'm fascinated about if first of all, how obviously that's why I always why  
**[0:16:53-0:16:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:16:53):**  soil at the beginning as a question why somebody spends their career of many other options  
**[0:16:58-0:16:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:16:58):**  in this specific one.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:16:59):**  And that's why I always ask that.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:17:01):**  But also, in this case, specifically on certification, in terms of if you had to scored on that framework,  
**[0:17:08-0:17:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:17:08):**  which means importance, let's start with importance, like if we would fix this, how much better  
**[0:17:13-0:17:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:17:13):**  would the world be if we fixed, in this case, certification issue of regenerative?  
**[0:17:19-0:17:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:17:19):**  Well, I mean, fixing agricultural production and the problems with factory farming and  
**[0:17:24-0:17:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:17:24):**  industrialized farming, it's not going to solve all the world's problems, but solve  
**[0:17:28-0:17:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:17:28):**  quite a few.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:17:29):**  It does a lot.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:17:30):**  A lot, you know, these are foundational issues.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:17:32):**  And this would provide kind of bedrock change.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:17:35):**  You know, if you have a healthier soil, you're sequestering carbon, you're cycling carbon  
**[0:17:41-0:17:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:17:41):**  more, you are growing healthier food, you are therefore having people with access to  
**[0:17:47-0:17:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:17:47):**  healthier food and more bio nutrients in their food equates to better health.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:17:51):**  So there's, you know, a whole cascade of effects that go with solving this problem.  
**[0:17:56-0:18:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:17:56):**  I mean, we've got so many different problems that relate to farming.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:18:00):**  Think of industrial ag is one of the highest emitters of greenhouse gases.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:18:06):**  So that's one, the exploitation of the vulnerable folks who are at that very, you know, the  
**[0:18:13-0:18:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:18:13):**  farm workers, the migrant workers, the farmers themselves.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:18:19):**  So you know, eliminating that exploitation, the soil degradation that is causing topsoil  
**[0:18:26-0:18:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:18:26):**  loss so that we have supposedly only about 60 harvest left, according to UN scientists.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:18:32):**  Which was a couple of years ago when that article came out, actually.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:18:36):**  So we have to, we're 55 probably.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:18:38):**  Right.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:18:39):**  That's true.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:18:40):**  And I don't know, I mean, that one.  
**[0:18:41-0:18:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:18:41):**  It depends where you are.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:18:42):**  It's context specific.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:18:43):**  Sure.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:18:44):**  Very complex.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:18:45):**  But I do think it's just so alarming when you think about species extinction and loss  
**[0:18:50-0:18:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:18:50):**  of topsoil and the kind of pervasiveness of toxic chemicals so that we are finding them  
**[0:18:56-0:19:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:18:56):**  in our bodies, in our blood, in our urine, in, you know, all throughout.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:19:02):**  Whether it's a pristine mountain stream far, far away from any agricultural production  
**[0:19:06-0:19:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:19:06):**  or you know, the Kern River.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:19:07):**  I don't know, but you're finding these persistent toxic chemicals everywhere.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:19:12):**  And so if we could eliminate those, I think like the importance of that cannot be understated.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:19:17):**  I completely agree.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:19:18):**  And I think everybody on the pod would be strays listening to this if you're not on  
**[0:19:21-0:19:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:19:21):**  that camp.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:19:22):**  But then moving to the T, the attractability, which is actually the solvability, like how  
**[0:19:26-0:19:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:19:26):**  solvable is that?  
**[0:19:27-0:19:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:19:27):**  And I would love to get your, your image, like how important is the ROC, the ROC, a  
**[0:19:34-0:19:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:19:34):**  good certification for regenerative?  
**[0:19:36-0:19:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:19:36):**  How crucial is that for the solvability of the huge agriculture issues, which are enormous,  
**[0:19:42-0:19:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:19:42):**  as you described in the previous answer, like how can this be in a relatively short timeframe?  
**[0:19:46-0:19:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:19:46):**  Like if we have 200 years, it's a different discussion, but we have 10, 15 and you said  
**[0:19:50-0:19:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:19:50):**  we have KPI, we want to have an impact on a lot of acreage, a lot of animals and a lot  
**[0:19:54-0:19:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:19:54):**  of people.  
**[0:19:55-0:19:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:19:55):**  So how crucial is good certification in that as a leverage point?  
**[0:19:59-0:20:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:19:59):**  Well, I mean, I think that good certification or this ROC certification is, could be really  
**[0:20:06-0:20:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:20:06):**  important in this, but we have to think like it is nothing's going to be solved that quickly  
**[0:20:10-0:20:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:20:10):**  on a global scale.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:20:12):**  It's 1% of our farmland in America is farmed organically.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:20:17):**  So that's 99% that we need to look at converting.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:20:21):**  And there has been tremendous movement, as you know, and I'm sure all your listeners  
**[0:20:25-0:20:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:20:25):**  are aware, like this whole concept of regenerative has seized a nation, it's seized the world  
**[0:20:31-0:20:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:20:31):**  and we're seeing conversions to regenerative practices on pretty large scale.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:20:37):**  We've got Cargill and Walmart announcing commitments to regenerative.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:20:41):**  Now I don't know what exactly, how they define regenerative, but if you are incorporating  
**[0:20:47-0:20:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:20:47):**  more practices to minimize tillage and to increasingly lean on cover crops and a really  
**[0:20:53-0:20:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:20:53):**  robust, beautiful mix of cover crops to build healthy soil.  
**[0:20:56-0:20:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:20:56):**  It's a good step.  
**[0:20:57-0:20:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:20:57):**  It's a great step.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:20:58):**  And so, you know, I don't think that the ROC is going to solve all the world problems,  
**[0:21:02-0:21:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:21:02):**  but in short order, I think, you know, it's going to require all kinds of shifts and,  
**[0:21:08-0:21:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:21:08):**  you know, just beginning and looking at the gains that we can make in this coming year  
**[0:21:12-0:21:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:21:12):**  and the momentum that we will gather from that and, you know, we'll be able to really  
**[0:21:17-0:21:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:21:17):**  prove this out, I think over time and show kind of the amazing potential that regenerative  
**[0:21:23-0:21:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:21:23):**  organic holds and the benefits that it brings to those farmers who implement those practices.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:21:28):**  You're very deliberate on the organic piece, which is very interesting in a sense that  
**[0:21:33-0:21:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:21:33):**  it's very deliberate built on top of organic.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:21:36):**  And you've always worked or you've worked quite a while in organic.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:21:39):**  Do you see that this is different because I'm sometimes worried that maybe organic at  
**[0:21:43-0:21:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:21:43):**  the beginning had the same hype as regenerative is now.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:21:46):**  I'm obviously in a bubble and literally we're in a bubble now because of COVID, but is this  
**[0:21:50-0:21:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:21:50):**  different because you interact with a lot of brands, like is regenerative hitting another  
**[0:21:54-0:22:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:21:54):**  nerve or a better nerve or a nerve better than organic did or is doing?  
**[0:22:00-0:22:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:22:00):**  Because only 1% is, like you said, it's only 1% of farmland and that's 30, 40 years of  
**[0:22:05-0:22:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:22:05):**  work.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:22:06):**  Right.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:22:07):**  And we forget that we're importing a lot here.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:22:09):**  So rather than have our own farmers in the US farming organically, we're bringing it  
**[0:22:13-0:22:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:22:13):**  in from other countries.  
**[0:22:15-0:22:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:22:15):**  So making that shift here for the farmers here to enjoy those benefits of the organic  
**[0:22:20-0:22:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:22:20):**  premium and the benefits of the organic farming that is done in a way rather than kind of  
**[0:22:25-0:22:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:22:25):**  input substitution model where you're just using a loud organic materials, but rather  
**[0:22:30-0:22:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:22:30):**  that you are really recognizing the vast benefits that come from building the soil, organic  
**[0:22:37-0:22:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:22:37):**  matter and creating a healthier living soil that that increases a farmer's resilience  
**[0:22:42-0:22:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:22:42):**  to drought and flood.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:22:45):**  And climate change is only increasing and exacerbating those problems at the farm level.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:22:50):**  Farmers are really, they work with such thin margins and kind of this unpredictable thing  
**[0:22:57-0:23:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:22:57):**  that we get now with climate change is, you know, having, improving their resilience and  
**[0:23:02-0:23:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:23:02):**  adaptability is huge.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:23:04):**  On top of like, as they learn over time that they can increase their yields with these  
**[0:23:09-0:23:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:23:09):**  practices and decrease their reliance on imports, also bringing in more pollinators and increasing  
**[0:23:17-0:23:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:23:17):**  the biodiversity on their farm and equals, you know, improved pollination of their crops.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:23:22):**  And I want to say one thing too, as far as you said, striking a nerve or touching a nerve,  
**[0:23:27-0:23:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:23:27):**  it's more like, let's think of it like playing a chord and finding a beautiful chord to play  
**[0:23:33-0:23:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:23:33):**  in music is that I think so many brands are reaching out to us.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:23:37):**  Resonating.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:23:38):**  Yeah, it's resonating.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:23:39):**  And I mean, we have one staff person who all week long is talking to brands and farmers  
**[0:23:44-0:23:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:23:44):**  who want to know how to get certified.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:23:47):**  And you didn't see that in organic?  
**[0:23:48-0:23:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:23:48):**  You didn't see that?  
**[0:23:49-0:23:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:23:49):**  No, not so much.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:23:50):**  Okay.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:23:51):**  So it is different.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:23:52):**  It's different for sure.  
**[0:23:53-0:23:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:23:53):**  There's some excitement around it.  
**[0:23:54-0:24:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:23:54):**  There's like all this, these people who want to partner and join forces and find ways to  
**[0:24:00-0:24:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:24:00):**  collaborate.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:24:01):**  And it's this concept that I am so excited to develop this year of this, the rock flagship  
**[0:24:07-0:24:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:24:07):**  farm, essentially.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:24:08):**  And so like the Rodeo Institute will of course be our first flagship farm.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:24:12):**  But then we've got other applicants right now who are doing such amazing work in their  
**[0:24:18-0:24:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:24:18):**  communities farming in these regenerative organic ways, and also feeding their communities  
**[0:24:24-0:24:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:24:24):**  and giving opportunities to just expressing all kinds of diversity and in those approaches  
**[0:24:31-0:24:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:24:31):**  there at those farms where we can start to celebrate that and help educate in a region  
**[0:24:37-0:24:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:24:37):**  other farmers.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:24:38):**  It's regenerative as unique to its location as all the practices are going to change depending  
**[0:24:44-0:24:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:24:44):**  on what you're farming, where you are, what your climate is.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:24:47):**  If it's an agroforestry setting or an annual row cropping or what have you, it's going  
**[0:24:52-0:24:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:24:52):**  to be different.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:24:53):**  So having these rock flagship farms in different regions to stand up as models and to be educational  
**[0:24:59-0:25:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:24:59):**  centers and help other farmers see and learn what they're doing is going to be, I think,  
**[0:25:06-0:25:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:25:06):**  really helpful in the movement.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:25:08):**  For sure with farmers, rather than send out trained NRCS tech service providers or agronomists  
**[0:25:15-0:25:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:25:15):**  or as we did in the Green Revolution, we were sending out all this great advice, quote unquote,  
**[0:25:20-0:25:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:25:20):**  from funded by USAID, funded by all the lobbyists or all the corporations that supported those  
**[0:25:26-0:25:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:25:26):**  projects and bringing chemicals to the world and bringing these other ideas of the Green  
**[0:25:31-0:25:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:25:31):**  Revolution to the world that were completely contrary to what you would want to see happen  
**[0:25:37-0:25:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:25:37):**  in so many ways.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:25:38):**  So I think having that education stem from the farmers within a region is really important  
**[0:25:43-0:25:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:25:43):**  and lifting them up as heroes in their communities and sheroes as the farmers who really get  
**[0:25:50-0:25:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:25:50):**  to help teach their neighbors.  
**[0:25:53-0:25:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:25:53):**  Farmers are always looking over the fence line at each other.  
**[0:25:56-0:26:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:25:56):**  And if they see that she's planting this cover crop over here and they're like, what in the  
**[0:26:01-0:26:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:26:01):**  heck is she doing over there?  
**[0:26:02-0:26:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:26:02):**  And they're making fun of her, which happens a lot, I think in the early days of organic,  
**[0:26:06-0:26:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:26:06):**  but then they start to see the success that she may be having with her yields or with  
**[0:26:10-0:26:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:26:10):**  her milk cows or the reduced number of times the feed truck comes to that particular farm  
**[0:26:15-0:26:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:26:15):**  is the farmers are all watching that.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:26:17):**  It's not a mystery to them.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:26:18):**  So that's one idea that I'm really excited about as far as just kind of helping build  
**[0:26:22-0:26:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:26:22):**  this movement and prove out the benefits of these methods.  
**[0:26:26-0:26:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:26:26):**  And in terms of like the big brands are starting to make commitments, you mentioned Walmart  
**[0:26:31-0:26:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:26:31):**  and we have Nestle, General Mills, Danone and many others.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:26:36):**  Are we going to see a twofold question?  
**[0:26:38-0:26:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:26:38):**  Are we going to see or do you hope to see any ROC certified ingredients in on their  
**[0:26:43-0:26:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:26:43):**  shelves anytime soon?  
**[0:26:45-0:26:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:26:45):**  And it also comes to another question of accessibility because organic has the, I mean, it became  
**[0:26:50-0:26:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:26:50):**  more accessible, especially in the last years, which maybe actually diluted some of the original  
**[0:26:55-0:26:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:26:55):**  values because it became more industrial and it became, maybe those two are connected.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:26:59):**  I don't know.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:27:00):**  In terms of ROC, is there not a trick, but is there a way to actually make this accessible  
**[0:27:06-0:27:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:27:06):**  to the farm workers that actually grew these crops to begin with, which in some cases really  
**[0:27:11-0:27:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:27:11):**  good nutrition dense food is completely off limit for many people.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:27:14):**  So what is the social part there in terms of consumers?  
**[0:27:17-0:27:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:27:17):**  Is that part of ROC?  
**[0:27:18-0:27:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:27:18):**  And if not, what are your thoughts about it?  
**[0:27:21-0:27:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:27:21):**  Yeah, well, let's see.  
**[0:27:23-0:27:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:27:23):**  So first off, as far as those large corporations go, if they are going to meet our criteria  
**[0:27:29-0:27:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:27:29):**  and they earn that seal, then they can have a consumer facing product.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:27:33):**  And Danone has been very, very interested in this, very supportive of it.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:27:36):**  I know General Mills is doing a lot with regenerative ag.  
**[0:27:40-0:27:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:27:40):**  With ours, it's regenerative on top of organic, so it adds another layer and it's challenging.  
**[0:27:46-0:27:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:27:46):**  I mean, I definitely recognize that it's a bit cumbersome to require the organic certification  
**[0:27:51-0:27:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:27:51):**  as the baseline for ROC because there's just a lot of, you know, we're limited by this  
**[0:27:57-0:28:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:27:57):**  law and we have to meet, we follow it even though we're not an accredited NOP certifier.  
**[0:28:02-0:28:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:28:02):**  We're only going to work with NOP accredited certifiers or those international equivalents.  
**[0:28:09-0:28:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:28:09):**  And we are organic as in our name, our trademark name.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:28:12):**  So we do have to abide by those rules.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:28:15):**  And that has its challenges, but I think ultimately is going to be really good because it just  
**[0:28:20-0:28:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:28:20):**  keeps that program really rigorous.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:28:22):**  And you know, that seal that is going to be forward facing means that those brands have  
**[0:28:29-0:28:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:28:29):**  gone through all those different.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:28:31):**  It means something.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:28:33):**  It does.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:28:34):**  And in our social framework, if you wanted to look into it deeper, you look at the ROC  
**[0:28:38-0:28:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:28:38):**  framework, there's a whole buyer's criteria.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:28:41):**  And so that applies to any of those brands who are going to have that consumer facing  
**[0:28:44-0:28:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:28:44):**  logo means that they paid a premium to the farmers.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:28:48):**  They made sure the farm workers met the social standards, which are quite high.  
**[0:28:53-0:28:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:28:53):**  They have long-term contracts with the farmers.  
**[0:28:55-0:28:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:28:55):**  There's transparency.  
**[0:28:56-0:29:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:28:56):**  So the farmers know where they're going and how long this contract is and that they have  
**[0:29:01-0:29:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:29:01):**  full transparency.  
**[0:29:02-0:29:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:29:02):**  And so it puts the farmers more in a position of power.  
**[0:29:05-0:29:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:29:05):**  And this idea of empowering the farmers and the farm workers, we're trying, you know,  
**[0:29:09-0:29:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:29:09):**  how you codify that through a framework is...  
**[0:29:11-0:29:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:29:11):**  Which hopefully makes it can afford the product.  
**[0:29:14-0:29:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:29:14):**  Yeah.  
**[0:29:15-0:29:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:29:15):**  And so then you get to like the cost, like, oh gosh, that's going to, that, that mango  
**[0:29:19-0:29:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:29:19):**  bar might cost like $5 instead of a dollar or something like you look at the cost of  
**[0:29:24-0:29:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:29:24):**  it.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:29:25):**  And so number one, you know, we're keeping our costs really low, our fees really low  
**[0:29:30-0:29:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:29:30):**  to try and help just onboard more farmers.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:29:34):**  And I think brands are really excited to commit to this.  
**[0:29:38-0:29:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:29:38):**  Like the brands I've been working with for the last two years are amazingly dedicated  
**[0:29:44-0:29:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:29:44):**  to doing this.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:29:45):**  And they, it seems like they have the margins to do this and to add, allocate a small percentage  
**[0:29:50-0:29:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:29:50):**  more towards support this effort.  
**[0:29:53-0:29:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:29:53):**  And then some, you know, you just look at how the brands are out there, how much money  
**[0:29:58-0:30:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:29:58):**  brands spend to go have a presence at a place like Expo West.  
**[0:30:03-0:30:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:30:03):**  Have you been to Expo East or West before?  
**[0:30:06-0:30:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:30:06):**  So when we're all back in circulation again.  
**[0:30:08-0:30:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:30:08):**  Just describe it for the international audience.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:30:10):**  What's Expo West or East?  
**[0:30:12-0:30:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:30:12):**  It's grown so much.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:30:13):**  And I mean, it's chaos.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:30:14):**  It is.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:30:15):**  It's a pretty chaotic event.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:30:16):**  Now it used to be something very much like by the original kind of movers and shakers  
**[0:30:22-0:30:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:30:22):**  in the organic sector.  
**[0:30:24-0:30:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:30:24):**  And it's gotten so big now.  
**[0:30:26-0:30:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:30:26):**  It's just a very expensive trade show.  
**[0:30:28-0:30:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:30:28):**  It's kind of a must do.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:30:30):**  You must exhibit there as any kind of food brand in this organic or natural sector.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:30:35):**  But it's definitely the most costly use of money.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:30:39):**  And I think a lot of companies could spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to have a  
**[0:30:43-0:30:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:30:43):**  really big presence at Expo.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:30:44):**  And a portion of that.  
**[0:30:46-0:30:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:30:46):**  What if some of that just went to the farm, you know, and you look, distribute that at  
**[0:30:50-0:30:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:30:50):**  the farm level and reward farmers for these practices by paying them premiums that allow  
**[0:30:55-0:31:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:30:55):**  them to really regenerate their farm and to thrive.  
**[0:31:00-0:31:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:31:00):**  And so I think that part is really important.  
**[0:31:02-0:31:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:31:02):**  And just, you know, other brands looking at the stability of their supply chains and seeing  
**[0:31:08-0:31:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:31:08):**  that it's not stable and they need to rely on this kind of constant flow of product from  
**[0:31:15-0:31:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:31:15):**  their suppliers.  
**[0:31:16-0:31:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:31:16):**  So they need to really help strengthen the communities in which they depend.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:31:21):**  So I think that's another reason for the brands who get really excited about this and are  
**[0:31:26-0:31:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:31:26):**  really throwing down and interested in getting a rock product out there.  
**[0:31:30-0:31:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:31:30):**  We hear from a lot of them and I think there's going to be some beautiful partnerships forming  
**[0:31:34-0:31:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:31:34):**  this year with some of those brands.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:31:36):**  I think it comes to, I don't know if it was a quote of Henry Ford, but starting to pay  
**[0:31:41-0:31:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:31:41):**  minimum wage so his workers could actually afford, afford.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:31:45):**  Because otherwise you need to, that market, the farmers have been squeezed, the farm workers  
**[0:31:50-0:31:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:31:50):**  have been squeezing worse.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:31:52):**  So it's really trying to switch or to flip that at some point, you have to start somewhere  
**[0:31:58-0:32:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:31:58):**  and it's going to be a challenge on all sides.  
**[0:32:01-0:32:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:32:01):**  And somebody has to squeeze a bit the margins and probably that is on the brand side, especially  
**[0:32:05-0:32:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:32:05):**  the brands with good margins.  
**[0:32:08-0:32:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:32:08):**  In terms of neglecting this, have you seen any other approaches globally on like a rigorous  
**[0:32:14-0:32:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:32:14):**  regenerative approach framework certification?  
**[0:32:18-0:32:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:32:18):**  Have you come across anything else in this space doing or trying or attempting this?  
**[0:32:23-0:32:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:32:23):**  There's some regenerative ag certifications or programs that are not necessarily attached  
**[0:32:28-0:32:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:32:28):**  to organic.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:32:30):**  And for us, we see regenerative as intrinsically linked to organic.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:32:34):**  It has to be organic or it can't be regenerative.  
**[0:32:37-0:32:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:32:37):**  You can call it regenerative ag if you're minimizing your tillage and adding a cover  
**[0:32:41-0:32:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:32:41):**  crop, but you're still planting roundup ready corn and soy that is feeding this concept  
**[0:32:47-0:32:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:32:47):**  of here in the US, all our subsidies drive farmers towards that at their peril.  
**[0:32:53-0:32:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:32:53):**  In some cases, but it's like it's our federal crop insurance program.  
**[0:32:56-0:33:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:32:56):**  It rewards them for growing roundup ready corn and soy the most.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:33:00):**  So it's kind of this idea that we have to produce cheap food that I think is really  
**[0:33:08-0:33:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:33:08):**  one of the neglected areas we need to really think about is changing our mindset.  
**[0:33:11-0:33:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:33:11):**  We aren't entitled to cheap food.  
**[0:33:14-0:33:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:33:14):**  Eggs cost more than 10 cents, but yet if you go to any big box store in America, you will  
**[0:33:19-0:33:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:33:19):**  find a dozen eggs for a dollar.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:33:21):**  I think that's outrageous.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:33:22):**  How do you produce an egg for 10 cents?  
**[0:33:24-0:33:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:33:24):**  You don't.  
**[0:33:25-0:33:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:33:25):**  Somebody's losing there and everybody's losing.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:33:28):**  In fact, I don't even know how it comes to that.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:33:31):**  The consumers are getting a product that is really low quality.  
**[0:33:35-0:33:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:33:35):**  The farmers are getting shafted or losing their farms and the companies that are benefiting  
**[0:33:41-0:33:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:33:41):**  are the ones that are getting government subsidies and they're paying low prices to their suppliers.  
**[0:33:48-0:33:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:33:48):**  So I think it's a mindset change that we really need to have and we need to value the production  
**[0:33:53-0:33:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:33:53):**  of healthy, high quality food.  
**[0:33:56-0:33:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:33:56):**  Let's switch gears a bit to the investment side.  
**[0:33:59-0:34:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:33:59):**  Let's imagine, and hopefully there are many impact investors or investors looking for  
**[0:34:04-0:34:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:34:04):**  let's say deep net positive impacts with their portfolios without giving investment advice,  
**[0:34:08-0:34:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:34:08):**  obviously, where would you point them to in terms of Regen Food and Ag?  
**[0:34:12-0:34:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:34:12):**  If they've read the books, they saw the movies, they visited some farms and now they want  
**[0:34:16-0:34:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:34:16):**  to get their hands dirty, where should they start or where would you start?  
**[0:34:20-0:34:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:34:20):**  One really important piece of advice, quote unquote, I'll say is patient capital.  
**[0:34:26-0:34:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:34:26):**  Not looking to turn, like invest in term money around so quickly that you have to be in it  
**[0:34:31-0:34:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:34:31):**  for the long term.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:34:32):**  And you've had one of my favorite people on your show, Philip Taylor from Mad Ag.  
**[0:34:38-0:34:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:34:38):**  And like what he's doing, I think is a fantastic example of how we can really build this movement.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:34:44):**  I'm not sure which episode that was and I didn't even get a chance to listen to the  
**[0:34:47-0:34:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:34:47):**  whole thing.  
**[0:34:48-0:34:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:34:48):**  But what Phil's doing with the perennial fund is pretty extraordinary.  
**[0:34:51-0:34:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:34:51):**  Yeah, we'll put it in the show notes.  
**[0:34:53-0:34:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:34:53):**  Cool.  
**[0:34:54-0:34:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:34:54):**  I think it's going to bring a lot of change.  
**[0:34:55-0:35:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:34:55):**  And it's like recognizing that farming is something adopting these different methods  
**[0:35:01-0:35:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:35:01):**  takes time.  
**[0:35:02-0:35:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:35:02):**  You don't just do it in one night.  
**[0:35:04-0:35:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:35:04):**  And it may even take like as you get off that chemical treadmill, it's going to take a  
**[0:35:08-0:35:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:35:08):**  few years to build the health back into your soil so that you don't need those chemical  
**[0:35:14-0:35:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:35:14):**  inputs.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:35:15):**  And as you incorporate more and more regenerative practices and improve your yields and recapture  
**[0:35:21-0:35:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:35:21):**  some of those profits at the farm level, the way Phil's program works, that they will loan  
**[0:35:27-0:35:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:35:27):**  the money to them.  
**[0:35:28-0:35:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:35:28):**  But then over time, once the farmers through that transition trough, that they'll be ready  
**[0:35:32-0:35:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:35:32):**  to start paying that back.  
**[0:35:35-0:35:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:35:35):**  And I think that kind of investment in this work is really important.  
**[0:35:40-0:35:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:35:40):**  And you had another really fascinating guest and I just throw it out there because I thought  
**[0:35:44-0:35:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:35:44):**  that the invisible fences with the collars.  
**[0:35:48-0:35:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:35:48):**  Frank Wooten.  
**[0:35:49-0:35:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:35:49):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:35:50-0:35:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:35:50):**  Frank Wooten.  
**[0:35:51-0:35:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:35:51):**  That's fascinating.  
**[0:35:52-0:35:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:35:52):**  I mean, because I do think a lot about it, like how much labor it takes a farmer to move  
**[0:35:56-0:36:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:35:56):**  fences, how many times they are spending having to go out and find the calves that got away  
**[0:36:01-0:36:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:36:01):**  or the sheep that got away.  
**[0:36:03-0:36:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:36:03):**  And also what it does to wildlife corridors.  
**[0:36:06-0:36:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:36:06):**  It's going to like open up entire landscapes for wildlife.  
**[0:36:09-0:36:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:36:09):**  In ways that we cannot even imagine yet.  
**[0:36:12-0:36:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:36:12):**  So much.  
**[0:36:13-0:36:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:36:13):**  It's really fascinating and maximize your forage intake by like looking on the satellite  
**[0:36:17-0:36:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:36:17):**  and drawing in wherever that, you know, in the morning rather than have to go out on  
**[0:36:22-0:36:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:36:22):**  used to be horse.  
**[0:36:23-0:36:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:36:23):**  Now, most farmers are out on four wheelers, but you know, they've got to go out and figure  
**[0:36:26-0:36:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:36:26):**  out where to move the animals next, especially in that peak growing season.  
**[0:36:30-0:36:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:36:30):**  So I thought that was super fascinating.  
**[0:36:32-0:36:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:36:32):**  And not being really in the investment world.  
**[0:36:34-0:36:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:36:34):**  So I'm probably not a good, don't have a lot of good tips on that.  
**[0:36:37-0:36:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:36:37):**  I have another question for you in that sense.  
**[0:36:39-0:36:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:36:39):**  What happens if you would wake up tomorrow and you're the investment director and actually  
**[0:36:43-0:36:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:36:43):**  it's your fund of $1 billion.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:36:45):**  So it's a lot of money and I don't need to know the exact breakdown.  
**[0:36:48-0:36:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:36:48):**  I'm interested in what you would focus on because I'm interested in decision making  
**[0:36:52-0:36:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:36:52):**  frameworks or what would you prioritize if you had not an unlimited amount of money,  
**[0:36:57-0:36:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:36:57):**  but a lot of money to invest.  
**[0:36:58-0:37:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:36:58):**  So not to grant, but to invest.  
**[0:37:00-0:37:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:37:00):**  It could come back without a return.  
**[0:37:01-0:37:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:37:01):**  I mean, that's up to you, but what would you focus on first, second, maybe third, or you  
**[0:37:06-0:37:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:37:06):**  would focus everything on one thing?  
**[0:37:07-0:37:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:37:07):**  No, I have a couple ideas there on where that money would go first.  
**[0:37:12-0:37:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:37:12):**  I think the first thing is infrastructure.  
**[0:37:17-0:37:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:37:17):**  Farmers really need improvements on infrastructure so that they can access the market and be  
**[0:37:22-0:37:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:37:22):**  more in control of it and not only have like one outlet, one Cargill elevator in every  
**[0:37:27-0:37:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:37:27):**  town across the Midwest doesn't give farmers a lot of options.  
**[0:37:30-0:37:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:37:30):**  So giving farmers, you know, investing in infrastructure so that they can get food to  
**[0:37:35-0:37:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:37:35):**  local market and they can diversify their crops.  
**[0:37:38-0:37:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:37:38):**  So you know, you need food hubs and distribution centers.  
**[0:37:41-0:37:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:37:41):**  We need mobile slaughtering units.  
**[0:37:43-0:37:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:37:43):**  We need different ways to receive that food besides the one grain elevator.  
**[0:37:48-0:37:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:37:48):**  So that would be one and that wouldn't just be across America.  
**[0:37:51-0:37:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:37:51):**  It could go all over the place.  
**[0:37:53-0:37:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:37:53):**  I think it's a problem everywhere or an opportunity.  
**[0:37:56-0:37:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:37:56):**  Yeah.  
**[0:37:57-0:37:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:37:57):**  Yeah.  
**[0:37:58-0:38:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:37:58):**  And definitely I like to think of it as an opportunity, but it's a huge problem.  
**[0:38:00-0:38:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:38:00):**  Like how people access food.  
**[0:38:01-0:38:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:38:01):**  So that would be, or how farmers can access the systems in which to deliver food in their  
**[0:38:06-0:38:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:38:06):**  food shed.  
**[0:38:08-0:38:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:38:08):**  So that would be one.  
**[0:38:09-0:38:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:38:09):**  And the other, you know, I touched on earlier talking about those rock flagship farms, but  
**[0:38:14-0:38:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:38:14):**  that farmer to farmer education to advance these types of practices.  
**[0:38:20-0:38:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:38:20):**  And we really need more research to prove the case for these.  
**[0:38:23-0:38:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:38:23):**  And there's just not enough funding going into research.  
**[0:38:26-0:38:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:38:26):**  So finding the ways to kind of funnel that money into proving the case for regenerative  
**[0:38:31-0:38:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:38:31):**  organic.  
**[0:38:32-0:38:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:38:32):**  And then the other would be to angle towards consumers back to what you saw with my pet  
**[0:38:37-0:38:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:38:37):**  peeve is this idea of cheap food is like educating consumers on the value of eating local, eating  
**[0:38:44-0:38:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:38:44):**  seasonally, eating food grown without chemicals.  
**[0:38:48-0:38:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:38:48):**  And in these other ways that you're going to have more bio nutrient rich food.  
**[0:38:53-0:38:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:38:53):**  And so, you know, consumers just need a lot of education on that.  
**[0:38:56-0:39:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:38:56):**  And we have vast amounts of money that go into the USDA food stamps program, but it  
**[0:39:00-0:39:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:39:00):**  drives people to purchase very cheap food and is resulting in like this complete epidemic  
**[0:39:06-0:39:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:39:06):**  here of obesity and diabetes and heart disease, all because we're after this cheap food that  
**[0:39:12-0:39:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:39:12):**  has no real caloric value or improves the health of those folks consuming it.  
**[0:39:16-0:39:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:39:16):**  I think it's a great answer.  
**[0:39:19-0:39:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:39:19):**  So we took your fund away.  
**[0:39:20-0:39:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:39:20):**  I'm sorry.  
**[0:39:21-0:39:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:39:21):**  If you have, it's maybe more powerful.  
**[0:39:23-0:39:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:39:23):**  You have a magic wand and you can change one thing in the agriculture system.  
**[0:39:26-0:39:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:39:26):**  What would that be?  
**[0:39:27-0:39:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:39:27):**  I think that we need to eliminate the influence from corporations who benefit from the subsidies  
**[0:39:34-0:39:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:39:34):**  that are driving farmers to more and more chemical and GMO production and basically  
**[0:39:39-0:39:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:39:39):**  tax, put a tax on conventional industrial agriculture, much like we have for tobacco  
**[0:39:47-0:39:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:39:47):**  or gasoline and use the taxes for that to reward farmers who are implementing these  
**[0:39:54-0:40:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:39:54):**  more farming in service of life and in service of their community and improving the ecology  
**[0:40:00-0:40:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:40:00):**  where they're growing food and fiber.  
**[0:40:02-0:40:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:40:02):**  I like the question because it forces you to pick one or it forces you to pick the highest  
**[0:40:07-0:40:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:40:07):**  leverage point if you had unlimited power, which is always nice to hear what people come  
**[0:40:10-0:40:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:40:10):**  up with.  
**[0:40:11-0:40:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:40:11):**  And as a final question, definitely borrowed or inspired by John Kemp.  
**[0:40:16-0:40:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:40:16):**  What do you believe to be true about Regenec that others don't believe to be true?  
**[0:40:19-0:40:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:40:19):**  Where are you contrary?  
**[0:40:20-0:40:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:40:20):**  That it can feed the world.  
**[0:40:23-0:40:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:40:23):**  That's what I believe to be true.  
**[0:40:24-0:40:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:40:24):**  That these methods can feed the world, that we can make changes to feed the world through  
**[0:40:29-0:40:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:40:29):**  connecting farmers with their communities, to moving towards these regenerative organic  
**[0:40:34-0:40:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:40:34):**  methods and that this model that we have been endlessly in pursuit of high yields come at  
**[0:40:41-0:40:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:40:41):**  a great cost.  
**[0:40:42-0:40:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:40:42):**  And really those types of farm systems are made like we're American farmers are duped  
**[0:40:47-0:40:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:40:47):**  into thinking they are feeding the world.  
**[0:40:50-0:40:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:40:50):**  But really what we do is we produce corn that goes to ethanol or that goes to corn and soy  
**[0:40:55-0:41:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:40:55):**  that goes to animal feed in other countries for us to import those and the livestock back  
**[0:41:01-0:41:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:41:01):**  here.  
**[0:41:02-0:41:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:41:02):**  It's just kind of a vicious circle of deception.  
**[0:41:05-0:41:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:41:05):**  And I think like letting farmers truly feed the world through these methods by bringing  
**[0:41:10-0:41:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:41:10):**  agriculture more local whenever possible and implementing these methods would be something  
**[0:41:16-0:41:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:41:16):**  I believe to be true and love the work of John Kemp.  
**[0:41:19-0:41:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:41:19):**  I think it's a great point to end.  
**[0:41:21-0:41:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:41:21):**  I think it's still there's a lot of bubbles to pop from people that really feel that the  
**[0:41:28-0:41:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:41:28):**  current industrial agriculture system is feeding the world, which by no means it's true and  
**[0:41:33-0:41:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:41:33):**  does that these cute regenerative farmers, which in many cases are enormous operations  
**[0:41:37-0:41:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:41:37):**  and producing more biomass, food, nutrients, calories than their neighbors are in no way  
**[0:41:44-0:41:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:41:44):**  possible.  
**[0:41:45-0:41:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:41:45):**  They could never feed the world.  
**[0:41:46-0:41:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:41:46):**  And my answer is really going to visit them and go and count some of the calories and  
**[0:41:49-0:41:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:41:49):**  go and see for yourself because it's quite a shocking illusion that we have that the  
**[0:41:53-0:41:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:41:53):**  current industrial ag system is feeding the world.  
**[0:41:56-0:42:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:41:56):**  Most of the world is fed by smallholder farmers and that does the region farmers can never  
**[0:42:01-0:42:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:42:01):**  they never can compete because maybe their corn yield is just a bit lower in a good year.  
**[0:42:05-0:42:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:42:05):**  In a bad year, it's always higher compared to anybody else, but they might produce, I  
**[0:42:09-0:42:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:42:09):**  don't know how many other crops.  
**[0:42:10-0:42:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:42:10):**  So it's a very interesting illusion that we never look at the full picture there.  
**[0:42:14-0:42:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:42:14):**  And I get really annoyed, but can we actually feed the world with it?  
**[0:42:18-0:42:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:42:18):**  Like really, are we still, are we still having that debate?  
**[0:42:20-0:42:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:42:20):**  Like we have the rock solid proof that it's very complicated, but it's absolutely possible.  
**[0:42:25-0:42:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:42:25):**  It's totally possible.  
**[0:42:26-0:42:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:42:26):**  I mean, we've just come out of four years here in America of complete lies being told  
**[0:42:31-0:42:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:42:31):**  by our president straight to the camera, to the news media that makes people think that  
**[0:42:38-0:42:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:42:38):**  like there's all these flaws in our system that, and you just keep repeating, repeating,  
**[0:42:42-0:42:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:42:42):**  repeating a lie.  
**[0:42:43-0:42:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:42:43):**  And then suddenly you've got a bunch of people believing it and seizing onto that and becoming  
**[0:42:48-0:42:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:42:48):**  so incensed that they may storm the Capitol, for example.  
**[0:42:50-0:42:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:42:50):**  Like we just saw it all happen and unfold before our very eyes.  
**[0:42:55-0:42:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:42:55):**  So I think you're totally right.  
**[0:42:57-0:43:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:42:57):**  That busting that myth, debunking that myth that we have to feed the world, like feed  
**[0:43:02-0:43:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:43:02):**  your community.  
**[0:43:03-0:43:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:43:03):**  Start with that.  
**[0:43:04-0:43:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:43:04):**  And if you grow some crops for export, like that's fine to diversify and bring in cash,  
**[0:43:09-0:43:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:43:09):**  of course, but really making that shift to feeding the community.  
**[0:43:14-0:43:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:43:14):**  And as you just said, like small farmers do feed the world.  
**[0:43:17-0:43:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:43:17):**  And so it's just, it's a misconception for sure.  
**[0:43:20-0:43:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:43:20):**  For better or for worse, I'm not saying it's an ideal system, but it's the amount of calories  
**[0:43:24-0:43:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:43:24):**  produced.  
**[0:43:25-0:43:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:43:25):**  And if you do it well, I mean, we've all, we've visited examples, but I would like to  
**[0:43:29-0:43:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:43:29):**  tell everybody that hasn't or is doubting here, like go visit very interesting, go visit  
**[0:43:34-0:43:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:43:34):**  farms first of all, and spend a lot of time there and go and visit the outstanding examples,  
**[0:43:40-0:43:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:43:40):**  the farms you, that will be flagship farms and others and see the amount of, I would  
**[0:43:45-0:43:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:43:45):**  say the amount of life created on it and the amount of food that comes off it, or fibers  
**[0:43:48-0:43:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:43:48):**  or oils or all of the above.  
**[0:43:51-0:43:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:43:51):**  But it's definitely the abundance is quite interesting to see in places that normally  
**[0:43:54-0:43:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:43:54):**  don't have a lot of abundance.  
**[0:43:56-0:44:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:43:56):**  I live on a little, like an acre and have a little micro farm and it's stunning how  
**[0:44:02-0:44:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:44:02):**  much food you can grow on just like one little area.  
**[0:44:06-0:44:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:44:06):**  And so when you take that with a farmer who's got real experience and really grows and does  
**[0:44:11-0:44:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:44:11):**  it all day long, like you can feed, you can grow a lot of really beautiful, healthy calories  
**[0:44:16-0:44:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:44:16):**  in that way and feed quite a lot of people.  
**[0:44:19-0:44:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:44:19):**  I just think everybody should do their best to know the hands who feed you.  
**[0:44:23-0:44:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:44:23):**  Know those hands, know those people, get to know farmers in your community and just remembering  
**[0:44:28-0:44:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:44:28):**  that farmers are a really vulnerable spot.  
**[0:44:30-0:44:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:44:30):**  It's tough, it's really tough work.  
**[0:44:33-0:44:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:44:33):**  And I think anything we can do to support and better know the farmers and the stewards  
**[0:44:37-0:44:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:44:37):**  of our land and food are going to bring us that much further to better health for us  
**[0:44:42-0:44:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:44:42):**  and for the planet.  
**[0:44:43-0:44:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:44:43):**  I want to thank you, Elizabeth, so much and wishing you luck with this crazy busy year  
**[0:44:47-0:44:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:44:47):**  and getting the 60 plus applicants and probably there will be many more coming in through  
**[0:44:53-0:44:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:44:53):**  the certification and getting products out there, ingredients out there and all of the  
**[0:44:57-0:45:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:44:57):**  above and getting all the partnerships with companies going.  
**[0:45:00-0:45:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:45:00):**  It sounds like a lot of fun and a lot of work.  
**[0:45:02-0:45:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:45:02):**  It's awesome.  
**[0:45:03-0:45:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:45:03):**  It's great.  
**[0:45:04-0:45:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:45:04):**  It is a lot of fun and a lot of challenges.  
**[0:45:06-0:45:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:45:06):**  And I mean, I just would say those 60 applicants came in when we haven't even really celebrated  
**[0:45:11-0:45:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:45:11):**  far and wide that we're open for business.  
**[0:45:12-0:45:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:45:12):**  We were doing a self launch so we can test our systems.  
**[0:45:15-0:45:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:45:15):**  So I'm excited to see what's going to happen once we start pushing it out there.  
**[0:45:19-0:45:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:45:19):**  And really, we've got a lot more certifiers coming on as well.  
**[0:45:21-0:45:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:45:21):**  So the more certifiers we have, the more we can do this work in different regions.  
**[0:45:25-0:45:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:45:25):**  So it's going to be a really great season of growth for us.  
**[0:45:29-0:45:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:45:29):**  And I thank you so much for your work.

**[0:45:39-0:45:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:45:39):**  And thank you for all your great work.

**[0:47:10-0:47:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:47:10):**  After a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of audio asking the question  
**[0:47:14-0:47:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:47:14):**  how to put money to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011

**[0:48:49-0:48:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:48:49):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:48:54-0:49:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:48:54):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:49:00-0:49:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:49:00):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find

**[0:49:21-0:49:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:49:21):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:49:23-0:49:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:49:23):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:49:25-0:49:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:49:25):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:49:29-0:49:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:49:29):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:49:31-0:49:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/elizabeth-whitlow#t=0:49:31):**  Before making any investment please find professional investment advice.

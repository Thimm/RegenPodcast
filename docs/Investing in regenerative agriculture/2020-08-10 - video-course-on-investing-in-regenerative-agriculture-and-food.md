**[0:01:52-0:01:54](https://gum.co/GgGixE#t=0:01:52):**  so you don't have to write along.  
**[0:01:54-0:01:59](https://gum.co/GgGixE#t=0:01:54):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:01:59-0:02:04](https://gum.co/GgGixE#t=0:01:59):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:02:04-0:02:08](https://gum.co/GgGixE#t=0:02:04):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find, or what kind of investors you could  
**[0:02:08-0:02:10](https://gum.co/GgGixE#t=0:02:08):**  find if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:15](https://gum.co/GgGixE#t=0:02:10):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:02:15-0:02:19](https://gum.co/GgGixE#t=0:02:15):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:24](https://gum.co/GgGixE#t=0:02:19):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design, and a lot more.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:25](https://gum.co/GgGixE#t=0:02:24):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:02:25-0:02:27](https://gum.co/GgGixE#t=0:02:25):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:29](https://gum.co/GgGixE#t=0:02:27):**  Unfortunately, that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:33](https://gum.co/GgGixE#t=0:02:29):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:35](https://gum.co/GgGixE#t=0:02:33):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:40](https://gum.co/GgGixE#t=0:02:35):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:44](https://gum.co/GgGixE#t=0:02:40):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea, or whatever you're drinking.

**[0:00:22-0:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:00:22):**  active in this huge agricultural and also cultural transition.

**[0:00:29-0:00:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:00:29):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture, Investing as if the  
**[0:00:34-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:00:34):**  Planet Mattered, a podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and  
**[0:00:38-0:00:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:00:38):**  agriculture space to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil,  
**[0:00:43-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:00:43):**  people, local communities and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:49-0:00:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:00:49):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:52-0:00:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:00:52):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:00:55-0:01:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:00:55):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat and it's time that we as investors, big and small,  
**[0:01:01-0:01:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:01:01):**  and consumers start paying much more attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:01:07):**  Before we get started, I've been recording these interviews next to my day job and I  
**[0:01:12-0:01:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:01:12):**  will definitely continue to do so and release about an episode a month.  
**[0:01:15-0:01:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:01:15):**  But at the same time, I would love to take this further, share more interviews, there  
**[0:01:19-0:01:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:01:19):**  are many more stories to share on investing in regenerative food and agriculture.  
**[0:01:24-0:01:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:01:24):**  More depth, improve the quality, maybe even doing some video series.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:01:28):**  So I started a Patreon community which makes it easy to support creators like myself.

**[0:01:49-0:01:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:01:49):**  Enjoy!  
**[0:01:50-0:01:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:01:50):**  So welcome to the podcast.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:01:51):**  I'm Koen van Zeyen, your host, and this time I'm joined by Victor Friedberg, Chairman and  
**[0:01:55-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:01:55):**  founder of Foodshot Global, a unique platform catalyzing food system innovation.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:02:00):**  Foodshot is an ecosystem of world-class, mission-aligned venture funds, banks, corporate strategic investments,  
**[0:02:06-0:02:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:02:06):**  and foundations that make up an integrated capital platform of equity, debt, and non-dilutive  
**[0:02:10-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:02:10):**  capital and industry resources.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:02:12):**  And our first focus is Soil 3.0.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:02:15):**  As you can imagine, this sounds extremely interesting to me and I have a lot of questions.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:02:18):**  So let's get started.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:02:19):**  Welcome Victor.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:02:20):**  Thank you to you to join.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:02:21):**  Nice to meet you.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:02:22):**  So you're calling in straight from the airport.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:02:24):**  That's why the background noise, we're going to do everything we can in editing to reduce  
**[0:02:27-0:02:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:02:27):**  it.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:02:28):**  But so far it's been good in terms of background noise.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:02:30):**  But a first question, what brings you to Soil and specifically Soil 3.0?  
**[0:02:34-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:02:34):**  Because you have a really interesting background story.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:02:37):**  Well first, apologies for all the travel and my carbon footprint has not been great this  
**[0:02:42-0:02:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:02:42):**  week, but I really do try to manage that as well.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:02:46):**  So I'm happy to speak to you.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:02:47):**  And yes, I'm very excited about FoodChat Global.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:02:51):**  We launched it a couple of weeks ago at the Global Climate Action Summit.  
**[0:02:56-0:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:02:56):**  And that's been a multi-year journey for me.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:02:58):**  So if OK with you, I'll just tell you a little bit of the genesis of the organization.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:03:04):**  Yes, please.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:03:06):**  So I think it all kind of goes back to an experience I had in Valencia, Spain.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:03:13):**  I was doing investment mostly in the global development space.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:03:18):**  I had founded a platform called Launch, which was funded by NASA, State Department, USAID,  
**[0:03:26-0:03:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:03:26):**  Nike, Intel, a bunch of other corporations to look at big global challenges, mostly in  
**[0:03:33-0:03:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:03:33):**  regards to energy, water, health.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:03:38):**  And on vacation from doing that work, I went to Valencia, Spain, I went into the central  
**[0:03:43-0:03:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:03:43):**  market there, and I ate a peach.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:03:47):**  And I did not recognize the peach as a peach.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:03:51):**  It tasted something wholly different from what I had experienced in the United States  
**[0:03:57-0:03:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:03:57):**  as a peach.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:03:58):**  It was epiphany of flavor, of freshness, and you could just tell by eating it of substance  
**[0:04:08-0:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:04:08):**  and nutrition.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:04:10):**  And I just started wondering, I'm a person of means.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:04:13):**  I can shop in Whole Foods.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:04:15):**  I can go to fancy restaurants.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:04:18):**  But here was a market where people, rich, poor, middle class, all shopped together,  
**[0:04:24-0:04:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:04:24):**  and were having communally a completely different experience of food than I was having.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:04:30):**  So in Launch, I really started to think about investments, not from an individual company  
**[0:04:38-0:04:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:04:38):**  perspective, but really in terms of systems.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:04:41):**  What were the systems, and how are they organized?  
**[0:04:45-0:04:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:04:45):**  What was driving them?  
**[0:04:46-0:04:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:04:46):**  What were the incentive systems?  
**[0:04:48-0:04:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:04:48):**  Who were the stakeholders?  
**[0:04:50-0:04:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:04:50):**  How was that system changing?  
**[0:04:53-0:04:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:04:53):**  How was innovation and investment affecting that system so that when you made an investment,  
**[0:04:58-0:05:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:04:58):**  you really thought about it holistically?  
**[0:05:02-0:05:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:05:02):**  And here I was having just eaten this peach and suddenly realized that food was a system,  
**[0:05:08-0:05:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:05:08):**  something that had not occurred to me before.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:05:10):**  And as I looked deeper into that system, it became pretty clear to me, and this was in  
**[0:05:15-0:05:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:05:15):**  2011, 2012, that this system was going to change dramatically over the next 10 years.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:05:24):**  And it was based on that insight that I founded a venture fund called SGG Ventures, Seed to  
**[0:05:29-0:05:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:05:29):**  Growth, and co-founded that with a group of like-minded people who had a passion for food,  
**[0:05:38-0:05:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:05:38):**  systems analysis, and investment, and developed a thesis around a soil-to-shelf approach to  
**[0:05:46-0:05:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:05:46):**  investment.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:05:47):**  So whether you were investing in a consumer brand, you had to look at how that consumer  
**[0:05:55-0:06:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:05:55):**  brand was going to scale over time and what within the system would need to change in  
**[0:06:00-0:06:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:06:00):**  order for that brand or that service to get to national or to global scale.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:06:06):**  So that was going to affect everything from manufacturing, from logistics, from ingredient  
**[0:06:12-0:06:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:06:12):**  supply chains, even farm management, and all the way down to the soil.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:06:18):**  So already just through the work I was doing at S2G, we were starting to think about the  
**[0:06:24-0:06:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:06:24):**  relationship of soil as the beginning to what would become the next generation of products  
**[0:06:31-0:06:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:06:31):**  and services.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:06:33):**  Everything was interconnected.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:06:34):**  And so that was the investment thesis, 30 investments now in that portfolio.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:06:41):**  And it was in the works that I was doing at S2G that I started thinking about, are there  
**[0:06:47-0:06:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:06:47):**  other tools that we could utilize to accelerate the systems change that was going to be needed  
**[0:06:55-0:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:06:55):**  in food to democratize food so that everyone globally had a baseline food experience and  
**[0:07:05-0:07:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:07:05):**  access to nutrition and flavor and culture that was equal?  
**[0:07:12-0:07:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:07:12):**  So I was doing that work and it was like venture capital is a very specific discipline, is  
**[0:07:20-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:07:20):**  a very specific set of techniques and processes.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:07:26):**  And it can be even insular as a fund.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:07:29):**  You can do co-investment with other funds, but start to think that collaboration was  
**[0:07:35-0:07:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:07:35):**  another way to approach food system transformation.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:07:39):**  And it was that beginning.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:07:41):**  Could collaboration be a new model?  
**[0:07:44-0:07:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:07:44):**  Could starting with the problems first be a new model?  
**[0:07:48-0:07:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:07:48):**  And it was those two ideas that came together that ultimately led me to found FoodShot Global,  
**[0:07:55-0:08:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:07:55):**  which is a collaborative group of investors, banks, foundations, funds, universities, NGOs,  
**[0:08:04-0:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:08:04):**  nonprofit organizations, all working collaboratively to focus on big global food system challenges  
**[0:08:12-0:08:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:08:12):**  and to catalyze capital, non-dilutive equity and debt to bring the next generation of companies  
**[0:08:21-0:08:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:08:21):**  and research to scale.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:08:23):**  So that's the mission.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:08:25):**  I can talk a little bit of why we started with soil, but that's the framework by which  
**[0:08:30-0:08:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:08:30):**  how FoodShot Global was founded.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:08:33):**  And your journey.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:08:34):**  Definitely we're going to dive into soil.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:08:36):**  But I'm going to ask a very silly question.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:08:37):**  Have you ever been back to Valencia and or have you ever tasted a peach that had the  
**[0:08:43-0:08:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:08:43):**  similar effect on you?  
**[0:08:45-0:08:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:08:45):**  Have you tracked down the peach to the soil?  
**[0:08:46-0:08:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:08:46):**  Like, have you seen the farmer that grow that peach that changed your life?  
**[0:08:50-0:08:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:08:50):**  No, but that does sound like a good idea.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:08:53):**  So let's do that.  
**[0:08:55-0:08:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:08:55):**  You and I will go to Valencia together.  
**[0:08:57-0:08:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:08:57):**  We should film that.  
**[0:08:58-0:08:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:08:58):**  I'm just imagining.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:08:59):**  I just hope that it's a really nice regenerative farm just for the story.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:09:04):**  But for sure, we can find another very tasting peach.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:09:07):**  No, but it's an interesting thing.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:09:09):**  The taste that you mentioned, the nutrients and then the soil as we now see and then we  
**[0:09:13-0:09:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:09:13):**  go back to the soil part more and more.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:09:15):**  I'm looking at the book of Dan Barber here and I know I think his brother and him set  
**[0:09:19-0:09:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:09:19):**  up a fund and I think their partners of you guys as well focused on taste and taste meaning  
**[0:09:25-0:09:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:09:25):**  good soil or good soil practices.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:09:28):**  Let's give it a bit more specific.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:09:29):**  So why soil 3.0?  
**[0:09:31-0:09:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:09:31):**  What's the because you're going to focus on different focus areas over the many years,  
**[0:09:35-0:09:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:09:35):**  hopefully FoodShot Global is going to run.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:09:37):**  Your first focus area is soil.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:09:40):**  Can you explain a bit more the why, but also how you're focusing on that?  
**[0:09:45-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:09:45):**  Because it's such a wide topic.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:09:46):**  Yes, I'd be happy to.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:09:49):**  And just a quick note.  
**[0:09:51-0:09:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:09:51):**  Yes, both Dan and Dave Barber are both friends and colleagues and I respect their work both  
**[0:09:58-0:10:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:09:58):**  from the Blue Hill perspective and then their new fund, Almanac, but then also this company  
**[0:10:06-0:10:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:10:06):**  that Dan has founded called Roast7.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:10:09):**  Have you heard of Roast7?  
**[0:10:10-0:10:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:10:10):**  Is that the one with the pumpkin varieties?  
**[0:10:15-0:10:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:10:15):**  I read an article I think on it.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:10:18):**  Yes, they started with butternut squash.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:10:21):**  But that tasted completely off the charts basically compared to anything else on the  
**[0:10:27-0:10:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:10:27):**  market.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:10:28):**  Yeah, that was the prototype for what would become Roast7's mission, which was to basically  
**[0:10:36-0:10:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:10:36):**  to breed for flavor, which if you think about it, reverses probably a half century of processes  
**[0:10:47-0:10:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:10:47):**  on hybridization, which flavor was being breeded out.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:10:53):**  You hoped that it would be part of it, but somehow it wasn't, obviously, as the industry  
**[0:10:57-0:11:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:10:57):**  moved to a different set of criteria, mainly transporting yield.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:11:02):**  The drivers, I think at the beginning, made sense in that food security became the primary  
**[0:11:12-0:11:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:11:12):**  driver for the system, efficiency, transportation, logistics, and also cost.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:11:18):**  How do you bring costs down?  
**[0:11:21-0:11:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:11:21):**  And coming out of World War I and the Great Depression and World War II, you can see why  
**[0:11:27-0:11:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:11:27):**  the mindset was of securing calories.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:11:30):**  And that became the driver of the system, both on the produce side and on the meat side.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:11:38):**  But then as that became more industrialized, clearly genetics and farming practices were  
**[0:11:45-0:11:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:11:45):**  used primarily on yield.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:11:48):**  It was the only organizer of the entire system was yield.  
**[0:11:53-0:11:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:11:53):**  And transportation and I guess some ways along, shelf life, longevity.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:11:59):**  So now, and I think this is the key point, is that the consumer has fundamentally changed.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:12:08):**  And yes, convenience and affordability and abundance are all still parts of what consumers  
**[0:12:17-0:12:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:12:17):**  desire.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:12:18):**  But now there's another set of attributes, another set of values that the consumer is  
**[0:12:24-0:12:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:12:24):**  asking for, and those are around nutrient density, flavor, authenticity, sustainability,  
**[0:12:33-0:12:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:12:33):**  regenerative.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:12:34):**  All of those things are now coming as being forefront for a new set of attributes and  
**[0:12:40-0:12:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:12:40):**  values that are driving the system.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:12:43):**  And I think that is a great progress for the food system and for people who love food as  
**[0:12:50-0:12:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:12:50):**  much as you and I and care about the planet as you and I.  
**[0:12:54-0:13:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:12:54):**  So I think that's the frame we have to look at from a historical perspective.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:13:00):**  But now, and this is what leads me to Dan Barber's work at Row 7, is okay, now if you're  
**[0:13:08-0:13:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:13:08):**  breeding for flavor, yes, there is a sensory reason why people who eat are going to react  
**[0:13:17-0:13:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:13:17):**  positively to that.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:13:20):**  But flavor is really just a shorthand for nutrients and for micronutrients.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:13:28):**  So we've breeded out from our food supply these evolutionary micronutrients in our food  
**[0:13:36-0:13:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:13:36):**  supply that have been sacrificed on behalf of yield.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:13:41):**  Which is probably why you got this explosion when you ate the peach.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:13:45):**  This epiphany because there was a whole different set of micronutrients in that peach compared  
**[0:13:49-0:13:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:13:49):**  to all the other peaches.  
**[0:13:51-0:13:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:13:51):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:13:52-0:13:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:13:52):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:13:53-0:14:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:13:53):**  And that you had local ecosystems or ways in which you could get that product to market  
**[0:14:02-0:14:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:14:02):**  in an efficient way.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:14:03):**  So at the point of someone biting into it, they're having the best experience that they  
**[0:14:10-0:14:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:14:10):**  can have with that food.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:14:12):**  Now obviously Europe is different than the United States and Spain is different than  
**[0:14:17-0:14:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:14:17):**  other countries in Europe.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:14:19):**  So I don't want to make broad generalizations, but I think that experience is important and  
**[0:14:27-0:14:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:14:27):**  I think it is the direction that we're going.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:14:31):**  So I in my speeches now, when I talk about this, I basically say that flavor is a system.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:14:42):**  And that system on the flavor side had broken down because all of the genetics and all the  
**[0:14:50-0:14:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:14:50):**  practices for forming were going into yield, breeding the nutrients out, loading them up  
**[0:14:57-0:15:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:14:57):**  with carbohydrates on the produce side and also on the meat side, obviously much less  
**[0:15:05-0:15:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:15:05):**  nutrient dense.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:15:07):**  So flavor is a system and it's a system to bring not only these culinary experiences,  
**[0:15:16-0:15:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:15:16):**  but these key nutrients that evolution has basically provided for us to do specific human  
**[0:15:25-0:15:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:15:25):**  functions of our bodies and all of that's interconnected.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:15:30):**  And all of it starts with soil.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:15:31):**  All of it starts with soil.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:15:33):**  And so you can't have that system work on a nutritional level if it's not working on  
**[0:15:40-0:15:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:15:40):**  a nutritional level on an ecosystem level with the soil itself.  
**[0:15:44-0:15:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:15:44):**  So when we were starting to think about FoodShot Global, where were we going to start?  
**[0:15:52-0:15:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:15:52):**  I'd like to say that the easy answer was, well, you need to start with soil.  
**[0:15:56-0:16:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:15:56):**  That actually took a while for us to get there.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:16:00):**  Why is that?  
**[0:16:01-0:16:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:16:01):**  What were the steps between?  
**[0:16:03-0:16:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:16:03):**  What were you thinking about if you want to share obviously before as a focus area and  
**[0:16:07-0:16:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:16:07):**  you thought, nah, but actually we should start at the bottom literally and with what's under  
**[0:16:11-0:16:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:16:11):**  our feet, what were the other options on the table?  
**[0:16:14-0:16:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:16:14):**  Well, I think first the processes had more to do with that you're now in a collaborative  
**[0:16:24-0:16:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:16:24):**  environment across multi stakeholders and that's the advantage of FoodShot Global.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:16:30):**  So now you have banks, funds, universities that are doing specific work with specific  
**[0:16:37-0:16:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:16:37):**  expertise, specific categories and they need to be aligned.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:16:41):**  So a lot of the initial work was aligning short, medium and long range milestones and  
**[0:16:50-0:17:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:16:50):**  interest areas and strategies to make sure that as a group everybody felt empowered and  
**[0:17:00-0:17:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:17:00):**  invested into a singular effort on this year to year basis.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:17:07):**  So some of the initial work was purely structural.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:17:10):**  How do you align a multi stakeholder group towards a singular purpose?  
**[0:17:16-0:17:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:17:16):**  You know, we had looked at in addition to soil, we look at a protein gap which was very  
**[0:17:23-0:17:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:17:23):**  top of mind.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:17:24):**  There's a lot of investment and work being done in that.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:17:29):**  So it was an area right before moving capital and there are a lot of very interesting companies,  
**[0:17:37-0:17:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:17:37):**  many of which I had the pleasure to work with and invest in through S2G, Beyond Meat, Ripple  
**[0:17:45-0:17:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:17:45):**  companies like that.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:17:47):**  So you had to align partners, you had to think about investment horizon.  
**[0:17:56-0:18:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:17:56):**  Where is this issue in regards to where capital is moving and where can FoodShot Global play  
**[0:18:06-0:18:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:18:06):**  a unique role or fill a white space that maybe other investors are slower to move towards.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:18:14):**  So we had a lot of discussions of what were investable areas, what were the horizons for  
**[0:18:20-0:18:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:18:20):**  investments and for scale within these sectors and then where could FoodShot Global differentiate  
**[0:18:28-0:18:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:18:28):**  itself and add value to the overall ecosystem.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:18:32):**  And it was through all of those conversations that we decided as a collaborative group to  
**[0:18:41-0:18:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:18:41):**  focus on soil first.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:18:43):**  And once you made that decision, you realized, okay, everything is literally built on top  
**[0:18:52-0:18:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:18:52):**  of soil.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:18:53):**  So of course it's the place to start.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:18:57):**  But that was not as obvious at the beginning.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:19:01):**  Looking back, it's always very easy to guess the lottery numbers and all of that.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:19:06):**  It makes life.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:19:07):**  So I hope that makes sense.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:19:08):**  Yeah, no, of course.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:19:09):**  Can you describe briefly, first of all, soil 3.0 and also what is the program or what's  
**[0:19:15-0:19:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:19:15):**  the current focus means on soil?  
**[0:19:19-0:19:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:19:19):**  What should we connect with you on?  
**[0:19:22-0:19:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:19:22):**  What should we send to it?  
**[0:19:23-0:19:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:19:23):**  Who can sign up?  
**[0:19:25-0:19:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:19:25):**  What are you looking for and how can we help?  
**[0:19:27-0:19:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:19:27):**  Well, first, thank you and appreciate the help in using your ecosystem to spread the  
**[0:19:34-0:19:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:19:34):**  word on FoodShot Global and our work in soil.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:19:39):**  I think the soil 3.0 frame is the way I started to think about it was soil 1.0 was kind of  
**[0:19:51-0:19:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:19:51):**  the foundation of agricultural society.  
**[0:19:55-0:20:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:19:55):**  And I think the world of gentleman farmers and in which regenerative practices, rotations,  
**[0:20:03-0:20:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:20:03):**  you know, cover crops, soil emphasis was already built into how people thought about farming  
**[0:20:12-0:20:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:20:12):**  and food and sustainability, although obviously they didn't think about it that way.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:20:20):**  And then, you know, soil 2.0 emerged, you know, in my frame, you know, as a result of  
**[0:20:29-0:20:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:20:29):**  that historical context we talked about before where food security, securing calories, focusing  
**[0:20:36-0:20:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:20:36):**  on yield at the expense of nutrient density, flavor, regenerative practices became primarily  
**[0:20:47-0:20:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:20:47):**  an extraction, you know, practice of nutrients.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:20:51):**  If you start to think about soil as a bank, we had, you know, nature had set up a system  
**[0:20:57-0:21:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:20:57):**  for a billion years in which regeneration was clearly part of it.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:21:01):**  And then in a very short amount of time, you know, we basically create a system in which  
**[0:21:06-0:21:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:21:06):**  there were only withdrawals and no deposits.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:21:10):**  And so I think soil 3.0, the way I think about it needs to now think about deposits as much  
**[0:21:18-0:21:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:21:18):**  as withdrawals and to stem the tide on first a lot of the environmental and organic matter  
**[0:21:28-0:21:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:21:28):**  crisis, you know, that we're having.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:21:31):**  You know, the stats, and I'm sure your listeners, you know, know some of those, but just the  
**[0:21:38-0:21:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:21:38):**  ones that I always think about is that 25% of the world's agricultural soils have been  
**[0:21:44-0:21:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:21:44):**  damaged to the point where they no longer can be reliably used for agriculture.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:21:49):**  Ten million hectares of cropland are lost annually because of soil erosion.  
**[0:21:53-0:22:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:21:53):**  And I had heard that that translates basically into 30 football fields every minute we're  
**[0:22:00-0:22:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:22:00):**  losing in soil.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:22:01):**  Now we could have a debate whether that's European football or American football, but  
**[0:22:07-0:22:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:22:07):**  it's still bad.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:22:08):**  We're losing them.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:22:09):**  We're not getting them back at the moment.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:22:12):**  And then for every 0.1 meter of soil eroded, you know, we reduce yields 4%.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:22:21):**  There's 10% loss of yields for every one degree rise in temperature.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:22:25):**  So clearly with climate change, this is only going to get more exacerbated.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:22:31):**  And then we burn 10 calories of fossil fuel for every single edible calorie.  
**[0:22:40-0:22:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:22:40):**  You know, that is not sustainable.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:22:44):**  So if you just look at it from here's what we're doing to the most precious resource  
**[0:22:49-0:22:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:22:49):**  on planet for human civilization, it is hard to imagine any future that has 10 billion  
**[0:22:58-0:23:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:22:58):**  people eating healthily and sustainably in which soil is not part of that, you know,  
**[0:23:07-0:23:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:23:07):**  future.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:23:08):**  You know, we have to focus there.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:23:11):**  It's become clear to me that soil is not just the nexus between agriculture and climate  
**[0:23:18-0:23:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:23:18):**  change.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:23:19):**  It's also the nexus between agriculture, climate change, and nutrition.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:23:26):**  And so I don't know if you had a chance to see or hear about the Harvard study that came  
**[0:23:32-0:23:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:23:32):**  out.  
**[0:23:33-0:23:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:23:33):**  I think it was about a month ago.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:23:35):**  And it basically envisions 2050 and a carbon density of 550 ppm.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:23:46):**  You know, it shows with those CO2 concentrations that nutritional levels of protein, iron,  
**[0:23:53-0:24:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:23:53):**  zinc and otherwise stable crops such as wheat and rice will be lowered 3 to 17%.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:24:01):**  And based on that Harvard study, you know, the projections of nutritional impacts at  
**[0:24:07-0:24:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:24:07):**  550 ppm are 2 billion people will be deficient in at least one or more essential nutrients,  
**[0:24:16-0:24:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:24:16):**  1.4 billion women of childbearing age and children under 5 will be at high risk for  
**[0:24:24-0:24:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:24:24):**  iron deficiency.  
**[0:24:25-0:24:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:24:25):**  122 million people will be protein deficient and 175 million people will be zinc deficient.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:24:33):**  So this intersection of soil, climate change and nutrition, I think is going to be the  
**[0:24:42-0:24:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:24:42):**  generational challenge of our lifetime.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:24:46):**  And so it just feels absolutely right that foodshops should start there.  
**[0:24:53-0:25:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:24:53):**  And to now answer your question more directly, as I started looking into this, it became  
**[0:25:03-0:25:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:25:03):**  clear that we know very little about soil.  
**[0:25:10-0:25:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:25:10):**  It's funny.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:25:11):**  It's really surprising.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:25:12):**  I mean, it keeps surprising me every day.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:25:13):**  But isn't it funny in a not a very funny way, actually, that the one thing we seem to be  
**[0:25:18-0:25:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:25:18):**  completely dependent on, except maybe for a bit of sea nutrients and water nutrients  
**[0:25:25-0:25:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:25:25):**  and fish, et cetera, is soil.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:25:27):**  And we hardly know what's happening, let alone the interactions between what we're growing  
**[0:25:31-0:25:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:25:31):**  on it.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:25:32):**  Yeah.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:25:33):**  So one of my favorite quotes is, we know more about the movement of celestial bodies than  
**[0:25:40-0:25:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:25:40):**  we know of the soil underfoot.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:25:43):**  Yeah, I read that one as well.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:25:45):**  If it wasn't so scary, it would be funny.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:25:48):**  Yeah.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:25:49):**  So is that what you're focusing on as well?  
**[0:25:50-0:25:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:25:50):**  I mean, to begin to understand, to just how do we I mean, you mentioned researchers as  
**[0:25:56-0:26:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:25:56):**  well into by shining this light on this very precious dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:26:03-0:26:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:26:03):**  Like, look, guys, we need to and girls, we need to focus on that.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:26:07):**  And we don't understand maybe 5 percent of what is actually happening underneath our  
**[0:26:11-0:26:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:26:11):**  feet.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:26:12):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:26:13):**  And so your listeners know that quote was Leonardo da Vinci in the year 1500 and not  
**[0:26:18-0:26:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:26:18):**  that much has changed.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:26:20):**  And so she's sad.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:26:23):**  So I think my view is that almost you can envision in the future that there needs to  
**[0:26:33-0:26:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:26:33):**  be a global soil map.  
**[0:26:37-0:26:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:26:37):**  That basically maps soil, soil quality, nutrient density, you know, almost like we have we  
**[0:26:47-0:26:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:26:47):**  have weather reports and weather systems that are incredibly detailed in the amount of data  
**[0:26:54-0:26:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:26:54):**  that we know on that.  
**[0:26:56-0:27:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:26:56):**  But on soil, we know more about like the few meters or a few kilometers above it.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:27:01):**  We know incredibly well.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:27:02):**  We can predict where hurricanes are going to land, etc.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:27:05):**  And we give them names.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:27:07):**  And but the few centimeters underneath is our feet or inches are completely unknown.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:27:12):**  Yeah.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:27:13):**  So I think, you know, one of the primary things where I think technology, science and capital  
**[0:27:20-0:27:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:27:20):**  needs to focus on is how do we get measuring systems and data systems to start to understand  
**[0:27:30-0:27:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:27:30):**  not only above ground phenotyping, but below ground phenotyping.  
**[0:27:35-0:27:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:27:35):**  And we're in the early innings of technologies around that.  
**[0:27:40-0:27:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:27:40):**  So I think we have a pretty good understanding of what genes are, but we don't know how they  
**[0:27:48-0:27:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:27:48):**  really express themselves.  
**[0:27:52-0:27:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:27:52):**  And then we think about the plant as, you know, kind of this discrete entity.  
**[0:27:57-0:28:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:27:57):**  And we think about, you know, soil and we think maybe a little more sophisticated around  
**[0:28:02-0:28:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:28:02):**  soil microbiome with more scientific understanding.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:28:06):**  But that interplay between soil microbiome and the plant, we're just really in the early  
**[0:28:14-0:28:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:28:14):**  stages for.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:28:15):**  So I think we have to start thinking about like a phytobiome, you know, really think  
**[0:28:21-0:28:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:28:21):**  about soil and plant as almost like a codependent single organism and put a lot of science and  
**[0:28:29-0:28:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:28:29):**  research into how that works with specific crops, with different soil types and different  
**[0:28:36-0:28:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:28:36):**  geographies with different, you know, sort of pressures coming from climate change.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:28:42):**  So I think that's one clear area.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:28:45):**  This is enough happening there in a sense that, I mean, you hear a lot of obviously  
**[0:28:49-0:28:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:28:49):**  on the GMO side and a lot of our vertical farming, like technology is going to save  
**[0:28:54-0:28:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:28:54):**  it there.  
**[0:28:55-0:28:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:28:55):**  But nobody ever mentioned soil or sort of mentioned that somewhere, I are soil-less  
**[0:28:58-0:29:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:28:58):**  or don't worry about it.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:29:00):**  We got it covered.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:29:01):**  Not literally because they would be using cover crops.  
**[0:29:03-0:29:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:29:03):**  Yeah, that would be better if they had.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:29:04):**  They got it covered.  
**[0:29:05-0:29:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:29:05):**  Yes.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:29:06):**  No, it was a pun.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:29:07):**  I mean, this was very good.  
**[0:29:08-0:29:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:29:08):**  But there are so many jokes you can make in these podcasts.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:29:11):**  But do you see that like this vision of not don't worry, technology will be fine and we  
**[0:29:16-0:29:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:29:16):**  either grow it in a huge vertical farm or we'll grow it in a sort of lifeless, soil-less  
**[0:29:22-0:29:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:29:22):**  platform and we put our GMO crops on it and don't worry about it.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:29:26):**  We'll have this in the next 30 years.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:29:29):**  Well, I think my view, again, you know, my frame is...  
**[0:29:35-0:29:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:29:35):**  I know this could open another hour of discussion and I do realize that, but I want to be conscious  
**[0:29:40-0:29:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:29:40):**  of your time.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:29:41):**  But what do you see there as a soil 3.0?  
**[0:29:44-0:29:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:29:44):**  I think any future that imagines 10 billion people on the planet eating healthily and  
**[0:29:50-0:29:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:29:50):**  sustainability will need soil.  
**[0:29:54-0:30:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:29:54):**  So all of these other approaches, whether it's, you know, plenty doing large scale,  
**[0:30:01-0:30:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:30:01):**  globally distributed vertical farms, that'll definitely play a role.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:30:05):**  I think there's not only room for that, but need for that in the market.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:30:10):**  That it is not going to replace the need for soil as the fundamental basis for farming  
**[0:30:18-0:30:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:30:18):**  and for food.  
**[0:30:20-0:30:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:30:20):**  So it is, in my view, techno folly to think about vertical farms or even, you know, people  
**[0:30:28-0:30:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:30:28):**  are starting to talk more about ocean farming, you know, mostly around, you know, different  
**[0:30:35-0:30:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:30:35):**  algae and kelp types, you know, for protein isolates and things like that.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:30:39):**  So, I mean, I think that too has a place, but it's not going to replace the need for  
**[0:30:47-0:30:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:30:47):**  soil.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:30:48):**  And if these other platforms are being invested in with massive capital, I think that's all,  
**[0:30:56-0:30:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:30:56):**  you know, great.  
**[0:30:57-0:31:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:30:57):**  There will be platforms that can scale and really add value into the market.  
**[0:31:02-0:31:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:31:02):**  There'll be a lot of failure.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:31:03):**  There's a lot of experimentation, you know, going on, but we're going to have to keep  
**[0:31:07-0:31:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:31:07):**  going back to soil, regenerating it, creating organic matter, finding crops that really  
**[0:31:17-0:31:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:31:17):**  could become more of the staple crops in the future.  
**[0:31:23-0:31:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:31:23):**  You know, I think there could be a shift where corn and wheat and soy are not the key crops  
**[0:31:30-0:31:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:31:30):**  for the future.  
**[0:31:31-0:31:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:31:31):**  The 80%.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:31:32):**  I think we have to start looking less at yield from a bushels per acre perspective.  
**[0:31:41-0:31:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:31:41):**  And I think there'll be a time, 10, 20, 30 years from now in which the spec is going  
**[0:31:46-0:31:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:31:46):**  to be more around nutritional levels per acre.  
**[0:31:51-0:31:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:31:51):**  And the crops are going to be more guided on that, in my opinion.  
**[0:31:56-0:32:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:31:56):**  So I think there's going to be a shift to different crops that can be more nutrient-dense.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:32:04):**  Markets that will develop around that, palates and culinary traditions, you know, that will  
**[0:32:09-0:32:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:32:09):**  come from that.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:32:11):**  And you know, there'll be a way in which those crops interact with soil in a much more regenerative  
**[0:32:19-0:32:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:32:19):**  way.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:32:20):**  That's my view.  
**[0:32:21-0:32:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:32:21):**  I mean, some of the things in perennials I think are really interesting.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:32:24):**  Very, very exciting.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:32:26):**  So there's a start of those conversations.  
**[0:32:28-0:32:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:32:28):**  They're just the start of regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:32:33-0:32:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:32:33):**  But last year, at some of the big consumer brand meetings and expositions, regenerative  
**[0:32:42-0:32:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:32:42):**  was a key discussion point.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:32:45):**  So it's moving from the periphery into key strategies for corporations.  
**[0:32:53-0:32:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:32:53):**  Unilever is starting to do interesting work there.  
**[0:32:55-0:32:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:32:55):**  General Mills is starting to do interesting work.  
**[0:32:58-0:33:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:32:58):**  Patagonia clearly is very devoted to this space.  
**[0:33:02-0:33:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:33:02):**  So I think we're at the start of that.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:33:05):**  And we're going to need baseline research and science so that we understand what's going  
**[0:33:10-0:33:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:33:10):**  on beneath the soil as well as above the soil.  
**[0:33:14-0:33:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:33:14):**  Below ground phenotyping is probably the hardest part of it.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:33:18):**  The chemical and biological interaction of microbiome and phytobiome is probably worthy  
**[0:33:24-0:33:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:33:24):**  of a lot of research investment.  
**[0:33:29-0:33:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:33:29):**  There are technologies on the below ground work.  
**[0:33:32-0:33:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:33:32):**  I just came from a group in San Francisco that was arranged by ARPA-E around agriculture.  
**[0:33:43-0:33:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:33:43):**  And there's a lot of LIDAR and different-  
**[0:33:46-0:33:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:33:46):**  To see what's happening underground.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:33:50):**  Spectral technologies that's starting to happen underground, some really cutting edge technologies.  
**[0:33:54-0:33:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:33:54):**  That are being put together there.  
**[0:33:58-0:34:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:33:58):**  Clearly a lot of work being done on the sensor and the data acquisition side, mostly in terms  
**[0:34:04-0:34:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:34:04):**  of predictive analytics for yield, which is important.  
**[0:34:10-0:34:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:34:10):**  But I think also there's probably a lot of these systems are now going to be thinking  
**[0:34:17-0:34:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:34:17):**  about flavor and nutrient density.  
**[0:34:21-0:34:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:34:21):**  Whether those are BRICS levels or protein levels or different micronutrient levels.  
**[0:34:28-0:34:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:34:28):**  I think where the market is going is that larger corporations, both from being under  
**[0:34:39-0:34:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:34:39):**  pressure from the market, but primarily under pressure from consumers who just want better  
**[0:34:45-0:34:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:34:45):**  food, that they're going to start thinking about their supply chains in a completely  
**[0:34:51-0:34:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:34:51):**  different way.  
**[0:34:53-0:35:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:34:53):**  And I think the brands of the future are basically the brands that understand that their brand  
**[0:35:00-0:35:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:35:00):**  actually is their supply chains.  
**[0:35:03-0:35:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:35:03):**  And I had a discussion in a previous podcast and somebody said, actually should be supply  
**[0:35:07-0:35:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:35:07):**  webs because change actually comes from a very difficult past and suggests all kinds  
**[0:35:14-0:35:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:35:14):**  of things that we don't want to.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:35:15):**  I think that's a much better term and I will use that from now on.  
**[0:35:20-0:35:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:35:20):**  But all of the other things that people think about brands, like how it's packaged and what  
**[0:35:28-0:35:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:35:28):**  colors are associated and what emotional, they're important.  
**[0:35:33-0:35:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:35:33):**  But what really is important for consumers is they're going to look at those labels.  
**[0:35:40-0:35:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:35:40):**  They're going to start looking for the cleanest labels possible.  
**[0:35:44-0:35:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:35:44):**  They're going to start looking for validation through blockchain that what's on that label  
**[0:35:49-0:35:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:35:49):**  is actually what's in the product.  
**[0:35:52-0:35:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:35:52):**  You're already seeing the effects of the breakdown of that trust and that equation.  
**[0:35:58-0:36:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:35:58):**  You have glyphosate showing up in trace levels and Cheerios.  
**[0:36:06-0:36:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:36:06):**  You have probably organic wheat coming in from Turkey and from Crimea that is probably  
**[0:36:14-0:36:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:36:14):**  not organic and is going into products that have USDA certification of being organic.  
**[0:36:23-0:36:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:36:23):**  The consumer is only going to put up with that for a very short amount of time.  
**[0:36:28-0:36:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:36:28):**  These supply webs are going to need to start aligning to all of this validation to clean  
**[0:36:36-0:36:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:36:36):**  label and to the point where I believe through these data systems, through these embedded  
**[0:36:44-0:36:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:36:44):**  networks, through these regenerative practices, that you're going to be able as a consumer  
**[0:36:51-0:36:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:36:51):**  to go onto your brand.  
**[0:36:54-0:37:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:36:54):**  You're going to be able to trace molecules back all the way to the soil and know the  
**[0:37:00-0:37:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:37:00):**  farming practices on specific farms, when specific crops were harvested, how they were  
**[0:37:09-0:37:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:37:09):**  segregated or not segregated along their logistics path, how they were processed.  
**[0:37:15-0:37:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:37:15):**  All of those things are going to come together in a digital platform.  
**[0:37:21-0:37:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:37:21):**  Unless the soil can be verified, the consumer ultimately is not going to be satisfied that  
**[0:37:27-0:37:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:37:27):**  what is on that label and what brands are saying are actually true.  
**[0:37:33-0:37:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:37:33):**  I just think these are inevitable and are going to come faster than we think.  
**[0:37:39-0:37:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:37:39):**  Which is very exciting.  
**[0:37:40-0:37:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:37:40):**  I want to ask a final question on the investor side.  
**[0:37:46-0:37:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:37:46):**  You've been gathering this group of investors, funds, banks, strategic investors, foundations,  
**[0:37:53-0:37:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:37:53):**  etc.  
**[0:37:54-0:37:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:37:54):**  Imagine there's a room full of impact investors, a theater full of impact investors listening  
**[0:37:58-0:37:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:37:58):**  to this podcast.  
**[0:37:59-0:38:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:37:59):**  Let's imagine it's huge.  
**[0:38:00-0:38:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:38:00):**  Everybody's on there.  
**[0:38:01-0:38:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:38:01):**  They see soil 3.0.  
**[0:38:02-0:38:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:38:02):**  They've read the books.  
**[0:38:05-0:38:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:38:05):**  They want to engage and want to become active.  
**[0:38:09-0:38:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:38:09):**  What would be your advice, obviously without giving them investment advice, but what would  
**[0:38:13-0:38:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:38:13):**  be your advice to where to start?  
**[0:38:15-0:38:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:38:15):**  If you want to deploy some of your capital, all of your capital or a big chunk of your  
**[0:38:20-0:38:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:38:20):**  capital in this revolution?  
**[0:38:22-0:38:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:38:22):**  I think the near term interesting transformative work, I believe, is being done in transformation  
**[0:38:33-0:38:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:38:33):**  from a chemical based farming system to a biological based farming system.  
**[0:38:40-0:38:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:38:40):**  Moving from a data poor farming system to a data rich farming system.  
**[0:38:46-0:38:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:38:46):**  I think those are two really interesting areas.  
**[0:38:50-0:38:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:38:50):**  I think there are funds that are being developed.  
**[0:38:55-0:39:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:38:55):**  You mentioned one, SLM Partners.  
**[0:39:00-0:39:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:39:00):**  I'm an advisor just for disclosure to SLM Partners that's doing an organic grain land  
**[0:39:08-0:39:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:39:08):**  fund so buying conventional farmland, converting it to organic and creating markets for these  
**[0:39:23-0:39:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:39:23):**  off takes for large companies that are really looking to get a head start on regenerative  
**[0:39:31-0:39:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:39:31):**  and to get a head start on validation and security around grains being produced in a  
**[0:39:41-0:39:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:39:41):**  way that are consistent with the brand promises that these companies are making to their consumers.  
**[0:39:47-0:39:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:39:47):**  Which is not an easy feat.  
**[0:39:50-0:39:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:39:50):**  We're in the middle of I don't know how many pasta scandals we had in Italy so far, but  
**[0:39:54-0:39:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:39:54):**  it's number 10 or something and we haven't seen the end of it.  
**[0:39:57-0:40:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:39:57):**  They're either imported or contaminated or definitely not from regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:40:03-0:40:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:40:03):**  As you know, pasta is a huge part of culture in many countries actually and it's just very  
**[0:40:08-0:40:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:40:08):**  difficult to find a proper clean value chain plus any regen activity on the soil.  
**[0:40:17-0:40:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:40:17):**  I think that's a really interesting area.  
**[0:40:20-0:40:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:40:20):**  I think where foodshot will be focused will be on advances in biological solutions, sensors,  
**[0:40:33-0:40:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:40:33):**  but now multi-dimensional in terms of what they can sense and store from a data perspective.  
**[0:40:42-0:40:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:40:42):**  And then predictive analytics, hybridization, especially with the coming changes in climate,  
**[0:40:50-0:40:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:40:50):**  how do you create seeds that are going to be naturally hybridized?  
**[0:40:56-0:41:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:40:56):**  Or even we could have a discussion around CRISPR as well.  
**[0:41:01-0:41:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:41:01):**  But I think CRISPR is a really interesting area, especially given some of the dynamics  
**[0:41:06-0:41:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:41:06):**  with need for yield, plant health, biodiversity, and climate change.  
**[0:41:14-0:41:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:41:14):**  So I think that's going to be a ripe area.  
**[0:41:21-0:41:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:41:21):**  Visualization systems, whether that is below ground phenotyping, above ground, LIDAR, microsatellite,  
**[0:41:37-0:41:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:41:37):**  all of these technologies that together form what I would call soil 3.0 in which all of  
**[0:41:46-0:41:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:41:46):**  these together are making the farmer smarter, not only from the ability to maximize yield  
**[0:41:58-0:42:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:41:58):**  efficiently and now do that in a non-chemical way that ultimately is going to have to be  
**[0:42:05-0:42:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:42:05):**  a knowledge-based approach.  
**[0:42:10-0:42:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:42:10):**  Chemicals have been, for the most part, have made farmers not have to think more systemically  
**[0:42:18-0:42:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:42:18):**  about the work that they do.  
**[0:42:20-0:42:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:42:20):**  And it's still very hard work.  
**[0:42:22-0:42:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:42:22):**  There are only so many hours in the day.  
**[0:42:27-0:42:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:42:27):**  So if digital tools, sensors, predictive analytics, monitoring systems, visualization systems  
**[0:42:37-0:42:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:42:37):**  can help them in the future to do that more efficiently, I think that will help their  
**[0:42:42-0:42:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:42:42):**  bottom line create more yield sustainably.  
**[0:42:46-0:42:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:42:46):**  Clearly, cover crops are going to be important.  
**[0:42:51-0:42:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:42:51):**  I think we have to find markets for those cover crops to become cash crops.  
**[0:42:56-0:43:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:42:56):**  I don't think just using them solely for regenerative and nutrient recycling is going to be enough.  
**[0:43:06-0:43:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:43:06):**  I think we have to find ways to turn that into profit centers for farmers.  
**[0:43:15-0:43:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:43:15):**  So I think there's some interesting work that can be done in that area from an investment  
**[0:43:20-0:43:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:43:20):**  standpoint.  
**[0:43:22-0:43:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:43:22):**  And then a lot of work in market creation.  
**[0:43:25-0:43:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:43:25):**  So there are companies that are creating markets for insurance that can help regenerative or  
**[0:43:35-0:43:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:43:35):**  organic farms be more resilient economically and have safety nets.  
**[0:43:46-0:43:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:43:46):**  Under them, clearly a lot of work in seed and what are the next generation of hybrid  
**[0:43:53-0:44:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:43:53):**  seeds that are being created for flavor or for resilience or for nutrient density.  
**[0:44:07-0:44:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:44:07):**  All of these things are rich and ripe areas now for investments.  
**[0:44:13-0:44:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:44:13):**  So I think it's a great time for soil 3.0 investing.  
**[0:44:19-0:44:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:44:19):**  Very exciting times.  
**[0:44:20-0:44:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:44:20):**  And the final question, I promise, if you could wave your magic wand and change one  
**[0:44:26-0:44:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:44:26):**  thing in the agriculture industry from a sustainability or actually regenerative point of view, what  
**[0:44:31-0:44:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:44:31):**  would you change today?  
**[0:44:33-0:44:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:44:33):**  That's a really interesting question.  
**[0:44:35-0:44:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:44:35):**  And the first thing that came to mind, and it's not sexy and it's not technology and  
**[0:44:43-0:44:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:44:43):**  it's not science, and I think this is what we're trying to do at Foodshot Global, is  
**[0:44:54-0:45:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:44:54):**  just the awareness and the education of the everyday consumer and our human civilization  
**[0:45:13-0:45:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:45:13):**  that soil is still the centerpiece for this.  
**[0:45:19-0:45:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:45:19):**  And as we're kind of walking through life, the soil underneath our feet is deteriorating.  
**[0:45:27-0:45:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:45:27):**  We can't see it just like the way it's hard to see carbon.  
**[0:45:33-0:45:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:45:33):**  It's the invisibility that is I think our greatest challenge.  
**[0:45:39-0:45:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:45:39):**  So how do we make the invisible more visible?  
**[0:45:43-0:45:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:45:43):**  And to bring that consciousness into everyday life.  
**[0:45:50-0:45:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:45:50):**  And once that happens, then change can happen very quickly.  
**[0:45:57-0:46:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:45:57):**  Without that, I think those timelines get pushed down.  
**[0:46:03-0:46:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:46:03):**  So I've had to wave my magic wand.  
**[0:46:06-0:46:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:46:06):**  It would be everybody waking up one day and saying and having kind of the epiphany that  
**[0:46:12-0:46:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:46:12):**  I had not at the market in Valencia, Spain, but the epiphany that I had around soil that  
**[0:46:17-0:46:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:46:17):**  was if we want anything to change, we have to start with the soil first.  
**[0:46:24-0:46:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:46:24):**  And I think with that, we have a perfect end of this podcast.  
**[0:46:27-0:46:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:46:27):**  I want to thank you so much, anybody.

**[0:46:41-0:46:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:46:41):**  I will put all the details underneath.

**[0:46:57-0:46:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:46:57):**  3.0.

**[0:48:32-0:48:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:48:32):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[0:48:34-0:48:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:48:34):**  After a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of audio asking the question  
**[0:48:38-0:48:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:48:38):**  how to put money to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011  
**[0:48:43-0:48:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:48:43):**  and recording these podcasts since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.

**[0:49:11-0:49:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:49:11):**  The soil builders, people working in this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers,

**[0:49:25-0:49:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:49:25):**  People that are building soil at scale.  
**[0:49:28-0:49:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:49:28):**  And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office  
**[0:49:31-0:49:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:49:31):**  or as private individuals or people who are putting other people's money to work through

**[0:49:41-0:49:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:49:41):**  No.  
**[0:49:42-0:49:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:49:42):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:49:45-0:49:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:49:45):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you and I'm very aware  
**[0:49:50-0:49:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:49:50):**  that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very different means.  
**[0:49:54-0:50:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:49:54):**  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[0:50:00-0:50:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:50:00):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[0:50:02-0:50:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:50:02):**  Thank you.  
**[0:50:03-0:50:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:50:03):**  So what is this course?  
**[0:50:04-0:50:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:50:04):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  
**[0:50:11-0:50:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:50:11):**  so you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:50:13-0:50:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:50:13):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:50:18-0:50:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:50:18):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:50:23-0:50:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:50:23):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[0:50:28-0:50:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:50:28):**  if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:50:30-0:50:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:50:30):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:50:34-0:50:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:50:34):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:50:38-0:50:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:50:38):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:50:43-0:50:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:50:43):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:50:44-0:50:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:50:44):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:50:46-0:50:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:50:46):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:50:49-0:50:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:50:49):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:50:52-0:50:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:50:52):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:50:54-0:50:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:50:54):**  Before making any investment please find professional investment advice.  
**[0:50:59-0:51:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/#t=0:50:59):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking.

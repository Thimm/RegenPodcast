**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:00:14):**  During her time as CEO of Patagonia, it grew to over a billion dollars a year global giant  
**[0:00:18-0:00:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:00:18):**  with a very strong activist focus.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:00:21):**  They launched their organic food company, Patagonia Provisions, plus the Regenerative  
**[0:00:25-0:00:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:00:25):**  Organic Alliance together with Dr Broners and Rodeo.  
**[0:00:28-0:00:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:00:28):**  So why after she left that role and that stage, she joined the early stage VC fund focused  
**[0:00:33-0:00:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:00:33):**  on regenerative technologies?  
**[0:00:37-0:00:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:00:37):**  This is the Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food podcast, Investing as if the Planet  
**[0:00:47-0:00:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:00:47):**  Mattered, where we talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:51-0:00:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:00:51):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:00:57-0:01:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:00:57):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:01-0:01:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:01:01):**  Why my focus on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:04-0:01:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:01:04):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:07-0:01:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:01:07):**  our land and our sea, grow our food, what we eat, wear and consume.  
**[0:01:12-0:01:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:01:12):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:16-0:01:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:01:16):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.

**[0:01:49-0:01:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:01:49):**  Welcome to another episode today with the former president and CEO of Patagonia and  
**[0:01:52-0:01:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:01:52):**  the current founding partner of Regen Ventures.  
**[0:01:55-0:01:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:01:55):**  Cohen Rose.  
**[0:01:56-0:01:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:01:56):**  Hi, Cohen.  
**[0:01:57-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:01:57):**  It's great to be here with you.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:02:00):**  And to start with a personal question we always love to ask.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:02:02):**  I mean, I don't even actually I don't know how you got into apparel and that side of  
**[0:02:07-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:02:07):**  things, but which I would love to hear as well.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:02:09):**  But then also, how did you then I'm not saying made the switch, but went in to the world  
**[0:02:15-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:02:15):**  of soil and the world of food and the world of agriculture?  
**[0:02:19-0:02:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:02:19):**  Well, I was working I've worked in traditional business my whole life in both technology  
**[0:02:29-0:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:02:29):**  and retailing.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:02:31):**  And I kind of hit this point in my life where I felt like my work was not aligned with my  
**[0:02:36-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:02:36):**  values.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:02:37):**  And at that point, I made the change to move over to Patagonia because, of course, you  
**[0:02:42-0:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:02:42):**  know, Yvon Chouinard, our founder, is just a very famous, responsible businessman.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:02:49):**  And I felt like I would have a lot to learn from him.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:02:51):**  And so that's how I ended up at Patagonia.  
**[0:02:53-0:03:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:02:53):**  And it was an incredible 12 year ride there the last decade, most of the last decade as  
**[0:03:00-0:03:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:03:00):**  CEO.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:03:01):**  But, you know, we really got into soil through working a lot on land conservation, ocean  
**[0:03:10-0:03:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:03:10):**  and waterway conservation and advocacy.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:03:12):**  And, of course, you know, you come to the realization that the best stewards of the  
**[0:03:17-0:03:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:03:17):**  land are indigenous communities who are local and have a stake in that community health,  
**[0:03:22-0:03:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:03:22):**  right?  
**[0:03:23-0:03:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:03:23):**  They're literally willing to stand in front of a bulldozer to protect their soil.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:03:30):**  And with soil and agriculture, it's the most important pillar of human health and well-being.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:03:37):**  And we had always been known, Patagonia had always been known as a pioneer in organic  
**[0:03:43-0:03:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:03:43):**  agriculture through their organic cotton program.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:03:47):**  But people were adopting organic cotton, but at a pretty low rate because they were wanting  
**[0:03:55-0:03:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:03:55):**  to buy cheap clothes, right?  
**[0:03:57-0:04:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:03:57):**  And so it felt more important to maybe make the connection of organic and regenerative  
**[0:04:06-0:04:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:04:06):**  practices which are so critical to the climate and biodiversity emergency that we face, that  
**[0:04:13-0:04:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:04:13):**  we focus on that.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:04:16):**  And Patagonia had always had a relationship with organic farmers and also with carbon,  
**[0:04:31-0:04:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:04:31):**  you know, understanding how farming affected carbon sequestration.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:04:36):**  So it was just sort of a natural thing for us to do.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:04:39):**  And we started, I founded the Regenerative Organic Alliance back in 2018 with the Rodale  
**[0:04:48-0:04:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:04:48):**  Institute and Dr. Bronner's and a few other organic brands.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:04:52):**  We put that together to create a certification that really outlined what regenerative practices  
**[0:04:57-0:05:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:04:57):**  were and would also give the consumer a high bar standard to say, hey, I know that this  
**[0:05:04-0:05:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:05:04):**  is being created at a regenerative farm or regenerative operation and it's also not using  
**[0:05:10-0:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:05:10):**  pesticides or synthetic fertilizers.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:05:12):**  So that's kind of how we got into soil.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:05:14):**  Do you remember like how that, I always like to ask if there was a moment or was a gradual  
**[0:05:21-0:05:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:05:21):**  process because of course you've been focusing on apparel and of course on the sourcing of  
**[0:05:26-0:05:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:05:26):**  the fibers, but that is quite a step to food.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:05:29):**  Like it's quite another, it feels like a very different beast or thing.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:05:34):**  Like do you remember when it was triggered?  
**[0:05:35-0:05:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:05:35):**  Was it a documentary?  
**[0:05:36-0:05:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:05:36):**  Was it a visit to a farmer that you said, whoa, this is wild?  
**[0:05:41-0:05:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:05:41):**  Well, I think there's, you know, Yvonne was always very interested and I think inspired  
**[0:05:48-0:05:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:05:48):**  by some work that Doug Tompkins was doing in Chile and Argentina around rewilding and  
**[0:05:56-0:05:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:05:56):**  regenerative farming.  
**[0:05:57-0:05:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:05:57):**  Laguna Bianca.  
**[0:05:58-0:05:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:05:58):**  Yes.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:05:59):**  Yeah.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:06:00):**  And I think that that was an inspiration to him, but how to operationalize that and actually  
**[0:06:04-0:06:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:06:04):**  make that happen.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:06:06):**  You know, there were a lot of conversations about how to do that.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:06:10):**  And like I said-  
**[0:06:11-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:06:11):**  After I said that, I mean that farm, I still use that picture as an example because it's  
**[0:06:15-0:06:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:06:15):**  just so incredibly beautiful, but it never was, I think, financially sustainable, which  
**[0:06:21-0:06:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:06:21):**  sort of an underpinning.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:06:22):**  We need that as well to convince more.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:06:25):**  But the farm, I mean, look for the picture.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:06:27):**  I'll put some links below.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:06:28):**  It's just like, I think that he called the tractor drivers artist or something like that.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:06:33):**  And you can see that like the photos are just spectacular.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:06:38):**  And I can imagine, yeah, that serves as inspiration.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:06:40):**  Yeah.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:06:41):**  And it's like everything else in the US right now.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:06:47):**  There's terms like organic and regenerative.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:06:52):**  They come under fire directly from the chemical companies and lobbyists.  
**[0:06:57-0:07:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:06:57):**  Alan Lewis uses this great term, the Fibberati, he calls them.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:07:03):**  And there's always a status quo that seeks to debunk the benefits of organic and regenerative  
**[0:07:10-0:07:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:07:10):**  practices.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:07:11):**  And that's what we need now to fight the climate crisis.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:07:15):**  And there's been such good research on organic and regenerative yields being competitive  
**[0:07:21-0:07:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:07:21):**  with conventional yields over the five-year transition period and organic systems producing  
**[0:07:28-0:07:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:07:28):**  yields 40% higher in a drought and things like that.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:07:31):**  So there's a lot of good data out there that says we should basically be going back to  
**[0:07:37-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:07:37):**  these ancient practices.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:07:40):**  And that chemical agriculture and monoculture and CAFOs are not good for people or the planet.  
**[0:07:50-0:07:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:07:50):**  And then your tenure ended at Patagonia and you could probably choose any job in the world.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:07:56):**  There would be opportunities popping up if you like it or not.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:08:00):**  And you decided to join a venture fund as a managing partner or founding partner and  
**[0:08:06-0:08:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:08:06):**  very specifically focus on you mentioned something now like we should go back to these ancient  
**[0:08:09-0:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:08:09):**  practices.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:08:11):**  But region ventures we've interviewed obviously the founder Dan, I'll put a link below of  
**[0:08:15-0:08:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:08:15):**  the interview as well, is very much focused on the technology side of things.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:08:18):**  So sort of feeling, I don't know if that's the feeling, but moving forward and making  
**[0:08:22-0:08:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:08:22):**  big steps into that.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:08:23):**  Like what was the rationale behind after all the choices you could make or also not do  
**[0:08:29-0:08:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:08:29):**  anything for a long time is to join this group.  
**[0:08:31-0:08:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:08:31):**  Nothing against Dan because I think he's amazing, but why this choice?  
**[0:08:37-0:08:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:08:37):**  Well Dan and I had worked together and invested together through the venture fund that I founded  
**[0:08:47-0:08:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:08:47):**  at Patagonia, which was working primarily on innovations and supply chain.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:08:53):**  And I just felt Dan and I were really value aligned about a few things.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:08:58):**  One was the speed and scale with which change has got to happen over the next few decades  
**[0:09:04-0:09:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:09:04):**  in order for us to have a livable planet.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:09:09):**  The idea that the kinds of businesses that we should be supporting are founders that  
**[0:09:14-0:09:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:09:14):**  are focusing on restoring the planet and not destroying it.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:09:22):**  And that the important thing about, and this is a startup fund, right?  
**[0:09:27-0:09:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:09:27):**  So we're focusing on really early stage companies and the technology has to enable that transition  
**[0:09:40-0:09:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:09:40):**  and can be a tool to really enable that transition.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:09:45):**  And so that's why I decided to work with Dan.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:09:48):**  I'm also on the board of environmental impact companies that I feel like we'll have.  
**[0:09:55-0:10:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:09:55):**  Will be the brands that will help with this just transition that we need to make towards  
**[0:10:01-0:10:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:10:01):**  electrification, towards changes in means of production, towards this new food system  
**[0:10:08-0:10:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:10:08):**  that we need to create.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:10:09):**  All of these are innovations and economic opportunities.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:10:16):**  And so it's very exciting from that perspective.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:10:19):**  And how is the, I mean, of course we're in a time where COVID has restricted travel quite  
**[0:10:25-0:10:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:10:25):**  a bit.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:10:26):**  The last few years, we're recording this at the end of summer 2022.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:10:29):**  Let's hope autumn will be less chaotic compared to the last few years.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:10:34):**  But how has the journey been?  
**[0:10:35-0:10:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:10:35):**  Because this was started right in the middle or even just before.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:10:40):**  How has the journey been as a founding partner of an early stage startup fund focused on  
**[0:10:46-0:10:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:10:46):**  specifically technology in regeneration?  
**[0:10:50-0:11:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:10:50):**  I think what's exciting is that most of the young entrepreneurs that we meet and founders  
**[0:11:00-0:11:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:11:00):**  that we meet, they grew up with this crisis front and center in their life.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:11:09):**  They grew up digitally native and with tremendous amount of information and access at their  
**[0:11:15-0:11:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:11:15):**  fingertips to make their own judgments about what's happening to people in the planet in  
**[0:11:22-0:11:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:11:22):**  the old model, in the status quo model, and then what they can do to change it and make  
**[0:11:27-0:11:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:11:27):**  a difference in the next couple of decades.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:11:30):**  I think they're really driven by, in the past, Yvonne Chouinard was kind of a lone guy in  
**[0:11:37-0:11:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:11:37):**  the wilderness talking about the importance of environmental responsibility.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:11:45):**  We've come a long way from there.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:11:50):**  For me personally, I felt like I want to spend the next couple of decades of my life where  
**[0:11:57-0:12:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:11:57):**  I can be useful focused on regenerating and restoring the damage that we've done to the  
**[0:12:05-0:12:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:12:05):**  planet by creating these new economies.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:12:08):**  They are new economies.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:12:11):**  I think that's the exciting part of it from a business perspective.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:12:15):**  I think of that based on products and services and technology that can enable that.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:12:25):**  What are some companies or one or two that you are that obviously is public, otherwise  
**[0:12:29-0:12:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:12:29):**  we wouldn't be discussing it.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:12:31):**  You're extremely excited about it.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:12:33):**  What do you get to work with now daily or weekly that really resembles for you that  
**[0:12:40-0:12:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:12:40):**  new economy piece?  
**[0:12:42-0:12:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:12:42):**  I'll go from big to small.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:12:50):**  From big, I'm on the board of a company called Rivian, which is focused on electrification.  
**[0:12:57-0:13:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:12:57):**  They were a clean sheet of paper company focused on electrification.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:13:02):**  They're doing an adventure truck.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:13:08):**  They did really interesting things.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:13:10):**  When they did their IPO, they gave 1% of their equity, put 1% of their equity into a fund  
**[0:13:18-0:13:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:13:18):**  for nature.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:13:20):**  I think it makes a commentary and it sets a leadership position of if you're going public  
**[0:13:27-0:13:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:13:27):**  and you're creating this huge liquidity event, why aren't you doing something for nature  
**[0:13:31-0:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:13:31):**  right now?  
**[0:13:32-0:13:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:13:32):**  Especially, you depend on it as an outdoor truck company.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:13:37):**  These are the pickup trucks that go into most extreme circumstances, which I don't know  
**[0:13:41-0:13:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:13:41):**  if that's a thing really outside the US because I think you could also take a mountain bike,  
**[0:13:47-0:13:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:13:47):**  but it's a huge market for outdoorsy and a lot of transport.  
**[0:13:51-0:13:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:13:51):**  Obviously, I think you have a huge deal with Amazon as well to get the trucks.  
**[0:13:56-0:14:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:13:56):**  I think it's representative of this transition that we need to make to electrification.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:14:02):**  I'm also on the board of and we've invested in a company called, Regen is invested in  
**[0:14:07-0:14:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:14:07):**  a company called Meaty, which is a plant-based, mycelium root-based, plant-based food company.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:14:16):**  Also really interesting because it's using a very ancient fermentation process essentially  
**[0:14:26-0:14:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:14:26):**  and creating a really nice high protein source, which we will need more of in the coming years,  
**[0:14:34-0:14:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:14:34):**  good protein sources at reasonable costs with a low environmental footprint.  
**[0:14:41-0:14:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:14:41):**  I find that whole space very interesting.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:14:43):**  Then on the technology side, some of this early technology that we've invested in, it  
**[0:14:50-0:15:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:14:50):**  runs the gamut between solar-powered robots that are used for weeding and farm support  
**[0:15:00-0:15:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:15:00):**  to mapping technology that's looking at how forest carbon is sequestered and giving us  
**[0:15:11-0:15:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:15:11):**  a way to look at that.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:15:17):**  Different solutions around democratizing carbon financing and how that will work.  
**[0:15:23-0:15:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:15:23):**  These are startups that Regen is investing in, which are enabling the transition that  
**[0:15:31-0:15:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:15:31):**  we need to make.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:15:33):**  How do you use this model of VCE, early stage seed or pre-seed and series A investing?  
**[0:15:45-0:15:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:15:45):**  How does it work within Regeneration?  
**[0:15:47-0:15:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:15:47):**  We've had many conversations here on the podcast where people say, yes, simply the time horizons  
**[0:15:51-0:15:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:15:51):**  maybe don't fit well, or even the return expectations of primarily software-focused or people that  
**[0:15:57-0:16:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:15:57):**  are used to crazy returns.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:16:00):**  How do you feel about that?  
**[0:16:02-0:16:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:16:02):**  Is there enough deal flow that fits that?  
**[0:16:05-0:16:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:16:05):**  Do we even want to fit that model of the crazy scale?  
**[0:16:10-0:16:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:16:10):**  We need the crazy scale.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:16:11):**  In impact, absolutely.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:16:12):**  But do we also need these exits, are they going to be there and justified as VCE model  
**[0:16:18-0:16:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:16:18):**  in Regeneration?  
**[0:16:21-0:16:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:16:21):**  The way I look at it is, if you're looking at investments in Regeneration and specifically  
**[0:16:32-0:16:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:16:32):**  food systems, you don't have to go too far.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:16:36):**  You can follow the money.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:16:39):**  Just look at the huge and in some cases, unprecedented valuations that the large food companies have  
**[0:16:44-0:16:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:16:44):**  paid for natural and organic products.  
**[0:16:51-0:16:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:16:51):**  There's a list that I couldn't even name how many, but General Mills has bought a ton of  
**[0:16:59-0:17:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:16:59):**  those companies, Cascadian Farms, they've bought, Denone bought earthbound farms.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:17:04):**  You can just go down.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:17:05):**  Mostly on the brand side, like the CPG side, right?  
**[0:17:08-0:17:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:17:08):**  Totally on the brand side.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:17:09):**  I really think of this as a product from a product perspective because everything does  
**[0:17:13-0:17:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:17:13):**  end up on the plate in some form.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:17:17):**  Investing in products grown with regenerative practices, right?  
**[0:17:21-0:17:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:17:21):**  Without pesticides and synthetic fertilizers and stuff, with short ingredient lists and  
**[0:17:25-0:17:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:17:25):**  high nutritional density, that is the future.  
**[0:17:28-0:17:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:17:28):**  If you don't think you're going to get a high return from that, I just think you're not  
**[0:17:33-0:17:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:17:33):**  paying attention.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:17:36):**  In citizens, this is interesting to me too, is that citizens are becoming much more enlightened,  
**[0:17:41-0:17:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:17:41):**  right?  
**[0:17:42-0:17:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:17:42):**  Partly because of technology advances and the poor quality of healthcare, right?  
**[0:17:47-0:17:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:17:47):**  People are taking control of their metabolic health and they're eating foods that are more  
**[0:17:55-0:18:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:17:55):**  nutrient dense, that are lower in sugar and fat and kind of all the things that the old  
**[0:18:00-0:18:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:18:00):**  food companies have lived off of.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:18:04):**  They'll pay the appropriate price for those products.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:18:08):**  They'll also become extremely brand loyal, which is why a lot of the food companies buy  
**[0:18:12-0:18:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:18:12):**  those brands, keep those names, and continue this Trojan horse approach to changing their  
**[0:18:20-0:18:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:18:20):**  portfolio.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:18:22):**  Which is a risky approach.  
**[0:18:24-0:18:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:18:24):**  We've seen many examples.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:18:25):**  I mean, you've been very involved in the B Corp movement as well, where the companies  
**[0:18:30-0:18:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:18:30):**  were bought and Ben & Jerry's was probably one of the first and many others followed.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:18:35):**  They didn't turn out to be the Trojan horse necessarily.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:18:39):**  The name is still there.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:18:40):**  In many cases, they're better ingredients than others, but also in many unfortunate  
**[0:18:44-0:18:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:18:44):**  cases, the real soul of the company and the real ethics and the impact disappeared when  
**[0:18:50-0:18:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:18:50):**  they were swallowed up literally by gigantic food companies.  
**[0:18:54-0:19:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:18:54):**  How do we prevent that with this new wave of regenerative CPG companies to not simply  
**[0:19:02-0:19:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:19:02):**  quote unquote sell out, which is great for the investors and great for the space because  
**[0:19:05-0:19:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:19:05):**  it creates a lot of momentum, but then maybe the large company doesn't change its sourcing.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:19:11):**  It doesn't become the Trojan horse, it simply becomes a horse and nothing really happens.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:19:16):**  Which is still okay, but it's not the revolution we need.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:19:19):**  No, I totally agree.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:19:22):**  I do think that the best brands learn from those acquisitions.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:19:28):**  Sure, there are plenty of examples of how they've destroyed them and they're not there  
**[0:19:34-0:19:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:19:34):**  any longer, but I also think that that was a different time.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:19:42):**  I do think that the changes in the customer, the citizen are starting to have a greater  
**[0:19:52-0:19:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:19:52):**  impact and you can't always look to the past to say what the future will be.  
**[0:19:57-0:20:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:19:57):**  I think regenerative ecosystems that grow delicious, nutritious food and they also unlock  
**[0:20:05-0:20:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:20:05):**  maybe the distribution around local distribution, that's a winning investment combination.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:20:14):**  I think some of these founders too, there's so much going on in the digital space now,  
**[0:20:22-0:20:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:20:22):**  they might be less likely to be dependent on that big company distribution and might  
**[0:20:29-0:20:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:20:29):**  think of going public themselves and creating other ways to create a liquidity event that  
**[0:20:35-0:20:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:20:35):**  are more meaningful.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:20:37):**  I think that's also an element too.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:20:41):**  I didn't really see any potential in the steward ownership discussion.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:20:47):**  I know Organic Grown in the US basically sold to itself and became a sort of forever company  
**[0:20:52-0:20:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:20:52):**  like Bosch in Germany and many others.  
**[0:20:56-0:21:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:20:56):**  To safeguard, I mean still perfectly fine to raise money, perfectly fine to make money  
**[0:21:01-0:21:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:21:01):**  of your investments, but the mission stays locked in and can never be changed even if  
**[0:21:06-0:21:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:21:06):**  the most quote unquote evil company shows up with $10 billion, we're not going to sell  
**[0:21:11-0:21:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:21:11):**  for that because we know the mission cannot be changed.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:21:13):**  Do you see a role for that or is that just too far out of the current system?  
**[0:21:19-0:21:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:21:19):**  I think the current system is challenging because the buyer has a lot of flexibility  
**[0:21:26-0:21:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:21:26):**  and there are things that I think that's one of the ways that the benefit corporation movement  
**[0:21:33-0:21:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:21:33):**  has been important because it enshrines the B Corp charter into the legal framework of  
**[0:21:46-0:21:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:21:46):**  the company and says these are the things that this company stands for and will either  
**[0:21:51-0:21:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:21:51):**  contribute to with philanthropy or whatever the model is.  
**[0:21:57-0:22:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:21:57):**  In Patagonia's case, it was giving 1% of sales to grassroots environmental groups,  
**[0:22:02-0:22:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:22:02):**  but I think that there needs to be a better corporate structure around that and I think  
**[0:22:11-0:22:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:22:11):**  B Corp is the closest thing that we have right now, but it's difficult.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:22:18):**  It's a difficult thing right now to make change in.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:22:21):**  I think the thing that's exciting to me about the entrepreneurs that we get to be in touch  
**[0:22:31-0:22:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:22:31):**  with with Regen Ventures is that they're pretty savvy about this stuff.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:22:38):**  They're thinking about it right now when they're getting their first round capital.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:22:42):**  They're thinking about who their investors are and are they value aligned and I don't  
**[0:22:46-0:22:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:22:46):**  think that was so much the case before.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:22:51):**  Which is hopeful.  
**[0:22:52-0:22:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:22:52):**  I mean, you need to think about it because if you go on a certain path or with certain  
**[0:22:57-0:23:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:22:57):**  investors, nothing against them, but it sets you up for an X amount of years or X amount  
**[0:23:02-0:23:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:23:02):**  of rounds and X amount of valuations and that might be not fitting, let's say, for the overall  
**[0:23:08-0:23:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:23:08):**  strategy or impact you're looking for.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:23:12):**  So we need awareness around that.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:23:16):**  In terms of, I mean, do you flow in this deep regeneration tech space?  
**[0:23:21-0:23:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:23:21):**  Very simple question.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:23:22):**  Do you see enough exciting and also good founders, potential markets and then all of that?  
**[0:23:27-0:23:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:23:27):**  How has that been?  
**[0:23:28-0:23:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:23:28):**  Because it's quite almost like a niche within a niche.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:23:34):**  I don't see it that way because I think I come from a background of making products  
**[0:23:41-0:23:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:23:41):**  and running businesses.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:23:44):**  And what I see is everyone is trying to figure out how do I get to my net zero goals?  
**[0:23:51-0:23:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:23:51):**  How can I make my supply chain more resilient and stable and good for the environment and  
**[0:23:57-0:24:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:23:57):**  good for the people that work in it?  
**[0:24:00-0:24:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:24:00):**  And everyone is dealing with those issues and they've made public commitments and ESG  
**[0:24:06-0:24:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:24:06):**  is a big part of governance now and that's getting sorted out, the harmonization of these  
**[0:24:16-0:24:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:24:16):**  ESG metrics.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:24:17):**  And so that's not going away.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:24:19):**  I mean, that is here to stay.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:24:22):**  And if anything, there's not enough, maybe not enough deal flow to match the demand of  
**[0:24:32-0:24:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:24:32):**  what is really this sort of mega trend to be able to track and manage projects, to be  
**[0:24:41-0:24:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:24:41):**  able to ensure that the carbon markets are accurate and verified.  
**[0:24:49-0:24:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:24:49):**  All of these transitions that need to happen that we talked about earlier.  
**[0:24:56-0:24:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:24:56):**  So I don't know, I feel very optimistic about that.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:24:59):**  I don't feel like it's nichey in any way.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:25:02):**  And I think it'll deliver exponential outcomes, both returns and impacts and with less risk  
**[0:25:13-0:25:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:25:13):**  than a traditional VC, I think.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:25:16):**  And what would you, I mean, you mentioned a few now, but what would you like if you  
**[0:25:19-0:25:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:25:19):**  had to pick one sub-theme or something you would love to see more of?  
**[0:25:22-0:25:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:25:22):**  Like what are you quote unquote missing in your deal flow database?  
**[0:25:27-0:25:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:25:27):**  I would love to see more companies tackling XYZ.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:25:30):**  What's really something you would love to get to see more of?  
**[0:25:35-0:25:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:25:35):**  Well, I think there's so much that we don't know about soil and kind of where we started  
**[0:25:43-0:25:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:25:43):**  the conversation.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:25:45):**  It's like soil is a mystery to us, I think, in terms of being able to really be able to  
**[0:25:53-0:25:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:25:53):**  measure carbon sequestration in a meaningful way.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:25:59):**  And when we crack some of that code, I think it will be really interesting.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:26:05):**  I mean, I'll give you an example.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:26:08):**  I'm on the founding board of a nonprofit that's called the Society to Protect Underground  
**[0:26:12-0:26:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:26:12):**  Networks and it's all focused on fungi with a brilliant-  
**[0:26:15-0:26:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:26:15):**  Spawn, yeah, we should have Toby on soon.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:26:18):**  You have got to have Toby on because she's brilliant.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:26:20):**  I mean, there are trillions of miles of micro risal fungi sequestering carbon around the  
**[0:26:27-0:26:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:26:27):**  world and they're actually going through a process of mapping that.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:26:33):**  And it's not just on farms, but in grasslands and deserts and-  
**[0:26:36-0:26:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:26:36):**  Forests and very extreme places, yeah.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:26:40):**  There's an amazing video, I'll put a link below.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:26:43):**  It's hilarious and very, very cool to see.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:26:46):**  So this fungus makes up, in different places in the world, can make up to 50% of the world's  
**[0:26:52-0:27:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:26:52):**  biomass and 75% of the world's terrestrial carbon is stored underground.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:27:00):**  We know very little about that.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:27:05):**  Toby is working to unlock that.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:27:07):**  I think she's the Jane Goodall of this generation and working on how do we unlock this network  
**[0:27:18-0:27:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:27:18):**  in such a way and learn from this network in such a way to make sure that we have a  
**[0:27:23-0:27:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:27:23):**  healthy functioning carbon storage network.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:27:28):**  That kind of thing to me is really interesting and there are so many different companies  
**[0:27:35-0:27:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:27:35):**  that could spin out of that idea and be helpful to this transition that we're trying to make.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:27:41):**  And so, yeah, I'm excited about that kind of thing and I think that we haven't even  
**[0:27:47-0:27:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:27:47):**  really scratched the surface, but we've got all these great young entrepreneurs working  
**[0:27:51-0:27:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:27:51):**  on it.  
**[0:27:52-0:27:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:27:52):**  And what do you believe?  
**[0:27:53-0:27:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:27:53):**  I'd like to ask this question inspired by John Kemp.  
**[0:27:56-0:28:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:27:56):**  He asked it slightly different, but what do you believe to be true about regenerative  
**[0:28:00-0:28:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:28:00):**  agriculture that others don't?  
**[0:28:02-0:28:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:28:02):**  If you go to a conference, where are you contrarian within, let's say, our bubble?  
**[0:28:08-0:28:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:28:08):**  Well I think I'm contrarian in a couple of ways.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:28:13):**  One, I do think regenerative organic agriculture, and I feel like I have to say the word organic  
**[0:28:18-0:28:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:28:18):**  because it negates then using synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, it can feed the world.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:28:27):**  We know that there's been enough research that proves it, but there's a lot of junk  
**[0:28:32-0:28:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:28:32):**  science out there funded by chemical companies that's invested in the status quo and it's  
**[0:28:38-0:28:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:28:38):**  got these captive ag schools that say you'll never get the yields, but it's just not true.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:28:45):**  And so-  
**[0:28:46-0:28:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:28:46):**  What can we do about it?  
**[0:28:47-0:28:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:28:47):**  We have seen the research, we have the papers, we've had the profitability papers of Dr.  
**[0:28:52-0:28:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:28:52):**  Jonathan Lundgren proving that it's better for the pest, it's better for your insects,  
**[0:28:58-0:29:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:28:58):**  it's better for your yield, it's better for your, especially for your profitability and  
**[0:29:02-0:29:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:29:02):**  all of that.  
**[0:29:03-0:29:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:29:03):**  And somehow, every time this question keeps coming up, like, okay, but it sounds real  
**[0:29:08-0:29:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:29:08):**  nice and cute, but how are we going to feed the world?  
**[0:29:11-0:29:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:29:11):**  Like, really?  
**[0:29:12-0:29:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:29:12):**  Are we still there?  
**[0:29:13-0:29:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:29:13):**  How do we, should we learn from the tobacco, like grassroot movement against it, how they  
**[0:29:19-0:29:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:29:19):**  silence it and still it's going strong, unfortunately, in certain places, but like, how do we unplug  
**[0:29:25-0:29:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:29:25):**  that blockage that we apparently have around yield to profitability that just isn't true,  
**[0:29:31-0:29:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:29:31):**  but seems to be continuing to be true, at least in the general audience's view?  
**[0:29:39-0:29:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:29:39):**  Well, there's a lot of, there's a lot, it's analogous to me, like the fossil fuel industry  
**[0:29:47-0:29:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:29:47):**  and climate, right?  
**[0:29:49-0:29:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:29:49):**  It's very analogous to that.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:29:51):**  There's a lot of big chemical interests, like, you know, let me think about once.  
**[0:29:56-0:29:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:29:56):**  Also using fossil fuels, actually.  
**[0:29:58-0:29:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:29:58):**  Yeah.  
**[0:29:59-0:30:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:29:59):**  Yeah.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:30:00):**  Yeah.  
**[0:30:01-0:30:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:30:01):**  There's a lot of big chemical interests that, you know, pay for that narrative to be out  
**[0:30:04-0:30:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:30:04):**  there.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:30:05):**  I think what needs to happen is that these entrepreneurs, these new, you know, CEOs of  
**[0:30:11-0:30:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:30:11):**  companies that are focused on regenerative and organic need to be more vocal, you know,  
**[0:30:17-0:30:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:30:17):**  they need to be able to have that public debate and have a policy and advocacy, you know,  
**[0:30:29-0:30:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:30:29):**  part of their business, you know, that lobbies just as hard.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:30:34):**  The problem is, right, the chemical companies have a lot of money.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:30:36):**  I mean, but look at Monsanto, you know, they finally won the battle against them to a degree.  
**[0:30:41-0:30:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:30:41):**  It was so bad that they changed their name and, you know, left the country, right?  
**[0:30:46-0:30:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:30:46):**  I mean, after poisoning our soil for all those years, you know, with cancer causing agents.  
**[0:30:53-0:30:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:30:53):**  So they can be vanquished, although they're sitting in bear right now, but they can be  
**[0:30:58-0:31:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:30:58):**  vanquished with both the changes in the consumer and customer behavior and also, you know,  
**[0:31:08-0:31:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:31:08):**  companies in terms of policy and advocacy.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:31:11):**  And that will help move things much faster.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:31:14):**  And I don't know if you're seeing this, but to me, it feels like everything is moving  
**[0:31:18-0:31:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:31:18):**  exponentially faster, right?  
**[0:31:19-0:31:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:31:19):**  Because we've been fighting these climate battles for so long and then all of a sudden,  
**[0:31:25-0:31:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:31:25):**  bam, you know, they just things are things are moving, you know, partly because we're  
**[0:31:28-0:31:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:31:28):**  in such a crisis.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:31:29):**  Right.  
**[0:31:30-0:31:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:31:30):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:31:31-0:31:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:31:31):**  I mean, if we look at this this summer, I don't think you can pick any place where it  
**[0:31:35-0:31:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:31:35):**  was a traditional summer, a normal summer.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:31:38):**  I mean, if you look at the heat waves in India and Pakistan, if you look at the heat waves  
**[0:31:42-0:31:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:31:42):**  in the US and Europe and many other places, if you look at the drought, the flash floods,  
**[0:31:48-0:31:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:31:48):**  everything seems to be happening faster than the worst scenario.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:31:52):**  So hopefully, of course, and go and this is probably this is probably the coldest summer  
**[0:31:57-0:31:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:31:57):**  you'll ever experience.  
**[0:31:58-0:32:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:31:58):**  Yeah, this is that's the scary part.  
**[0:32:01-0:32:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:32:01):**  Right.  
**[0:32:02-0:32:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:32:02):**  I mean, that's that's what's terrifying, you know.  
**[0:32:06-0:32:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:32:06):**  And what gives you hope then?  
**[0:32:07-0:32:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:32:07):**  Like, are you with all that you've seen and the fights you fought in the apparel industry  
**[0:32:12-0:32:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:32:12):**  and in the chemical food against the chemical food industry, but still within it because  
**[0:32:17-0:32:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:32:17):**  you were fighting?  
**[0:32:18-0:32:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:32:18):**  And like, what are you optimistic?  
**[0:32:21-0:32:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:32:21):**  And if so, why?  
**[0:32:24-0:32:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:32:24):**  Well, I feel like I'm realistic about, you know, the damage that's been done.  
**[0:32:31-0:32:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:32:31):**  But, you know, I have to say one thing about working in conservation of public lands and  
**[0:32:39-0:32:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:32:39):**  working with indigenous groups that are working on public lands issues is, you know, when  
**[0:32:46-0:32:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:32:46):**  you undam a river, the fish stocks come back, you know, the river comes back to life.  
**[0:32:54-0:33:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:32:54):**  And so I believe in nature's ability to restore and regenerate itself if we stop doing the  
**[0:33:02-0:33:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:33:02):**  harmful things that we're doing.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:33:05):**  And it can do it quite quickly.  
**[0:33:07-0:33:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:33:07):**  I mean, we saw that in, you know, in L.A. after a week of, you know, covid lockdown.  
**[0:33:14-0:33:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:33:14):**  I walked outside my house and I was like, I've never seen skies this blue in Los Angeles.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:33:21):**  The speed is, yeah, very hopeful.  
**[0:33:25-0:33:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:33:25):**  And so what would you let's say we do this in a theater somewhere and there's a live  
**[0:33:30-0:33:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:33:30):**  audience full of investors, people working in the finance space, people working in this  
**[0:33:35-0:33:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:33:35):**  space.  
**[0:33:36-0:33:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:33:36):**  Where would you, of course, without giving investment advice, but where would you tell  
**[0:33:39-0:33:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:33:39):**  them to look deeper or to dig a bit deeper?  
**[0:33:43-0:33:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:33:43):**  Is it mostly mycelium?  
**[0:33:44-0:33:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:33:44):**  Like, what are places where we definitely need, let's say, more energy, more people,  
**[0:33:48-0:33:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:33:48):**  more resources, more funding, more investments, of course.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:33:50):**  But what would you tell them to do in this region?  
**[0:33:53-0:33:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:33:53):**  I can food space, a regeneration space.  
**[0:33:55-0:34:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:33:55):**  Where would you tell them to, OK, go go and explore there a bit deeper and a bit further?  
**[0:34:03-0:34:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:34:03):**  For sure, it is in the soil and it is in that network underneath the soil, which includes  
**[0:34:12-0:34:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:34:12):**  mycorrhizal fungi.  
**[0:34:13-0:34:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:34:13):**  It includes it includes all kinds of issues around soil health and in, you know, from  
**[0:34:18-0:34:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:34:18):**  forestation to grasslands management to, I mean, simple things that sound simple, but  
**[0:34:25-0:34:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:34:25):**  they're they're they're difficult to to implement, but need more energy and financing and innovation  
**[0:34:31-0:34:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:34:31):**  and thinking is just, you know, like pasture raised animals.  
**[0:34:34-0:34:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:34:34):**  Right.  
**[0:34:35-0:34:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:34:35):**  I mean, if we eliminated all of CAFO today, I mean, you'd see water systems restored.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:34:41):**  You'd see waterways and rivers restored.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:34:44):**  You'd see, you know, you'd be able to fish in your local stream again.  
**[0:34:47-0:34:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:34:47):**  You know, there are so many benefits to like rethinking a lot of these sort of status quo  
**[0:34:55-0:35:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:34:55):**  ways of of implementing our food system.  
**[0:35:02-0:35:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:35:02):**  And so I think I think that to me is really a place, you know, agriculture, food systems.  
**[0:35:11-0:35:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:35:11):**  You know, I think I would generally stay away from like the GMO, CRISPR, science, you know,  
**[0:35:19-0:35:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:35:19):**  gene editing stuff, because, you know, we've had that for years and it really, you know,  
**[0:35:23-0:35:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:35:23):**  it hasn't it hasn't been perceived as anything good for people or the planet.  
**[0:35:28-0:35:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:35:28):**  And you know, I know that there are I don't know how many European nations it is now,  
**[0:35:32-0:35:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:35:32):**  Cohen, that have that have banned GMOs, but it's more than seven, I think, or six or  
**[0:35:38-0:35:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:35:38):**  seven.  
**[0:35:39-0:35:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:35:39):**  So soil is the wealth of our nation and there needs to be a lot more attention put on soil  
**[0:35:46-0:35:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:35:46):**  and the impacts that soil have on our on our life and our health.  
**[0:35:52-0:35:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:35:52):**  And what do you tell me you bring up the animal protein side?  
**[0:35:55-0:36:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:35:55):**  And of course, as a region ventures, you're investing in a number of plant based companies.  
**[0:36:00-0:36:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:36:00):**  What do you tell like a hard core like we're still in the same theater and on hardcore  
**[0:36:05-0:36:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:36:05):**  and the person following a vegan diet stands up and says, Yeah, but what about the animals?  
**[0:36:11-0:36:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:36:11):**  Like, what's the what is your normal?  
**[0:36:13-0:36:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:36:13):**  Because I struggle with that, honestly, that the normal answer, what is your your usual  
**[0:36:19-0:36:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:36:19):**  response to when people really respond quite badly to the potential of grazing animals  
**[0:36:26-0:36:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:36:26):**  and the potential that has in an ecosystem?  
**[0:36:29-0:36:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:36:29):**  What is your usual I'm asking for a friend, a QA me, like, what do you respond to to somebody  
**[0:36:34-0:36:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:36:34):**  that that really focuses on getting all animals out of the food system?  
**[0:36:40-0:36:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:36:40):**  Yeah, I understand that.  
**[0:36:43-0:36:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:36:43):**  I don't think it's it's going to happen anytime soon.  
**[0:36:47-0:36:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:36:47):**  I think that people need to be making huge reductions in the amount of meat that they're  
**[0:36:54-0:37:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:36:54):**  eating and if they buy meat, it needs to be, you know, you know, made in the correct way.  
**[0:37:00-0:37:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:37:00):**  And I'm not saying the burden of cost should be put on people.  
**[0:37:03-0:37:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:37:03):**  But I think that's that's more on regulation and many and, you know, product creation.  
**[0:37:09-0:37:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:37:09):**  But, you know, when I look at like, you know, the example of how it's done well, I think  
**[0:37:14-0:37:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:37:14):**  about Dan O'Brien at Wild Idea in South Dakota, who restored that South Dakota plain that  
**[0:37:20-0:37:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:37:20):**  was destroyed by cow farming that didn't belong on the on the South Dakota plain, restored  
**[0:37:26-0:37:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:37:26):**  the native grasses and, you know, restored the keystone species on the on the plain.  
**[0:37:32-0:37:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:37:32):**  And it's beautiful.  
**[0:37:33-0:37:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:37:33):**  You go there and you can hear the burrowing owls and you can hear all the birds and see  
**[0:37:38-0:37:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:37:38):**  the whole ecosystem restored.  
**[0:37:40-0:37:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:37:40):**  Now, he didn't do that as an NGO.  
**[0:37:42-0:37:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:37:42):**  He's like, I need to make money needs to pay for itself.  
**[0:37:45-0:37:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:37:45):**  So he's selling buffalo meat, but he's doing grass harvesting.  
**[0:37:49-0:37:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:37:49):**  He's doing the most humane harvesting I've ever seen.  
**[0:37:52-0:37:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:37:52):**  Patagonia, we helped to fund fund that.  
**[0:37:56-0:37:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:37:56):**  So you know, I get it.  
**[0:37:58-0:38:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:37:58):**  But I also get that like we need grazing animals on the on the binome, you know, and so grazing  
**[0:38:05-0:38:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:38:05):**  animals done right is good for the planet.  
**[0:38:09-0:38:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:38:09):**  And what role can technology play there?  
**[0:38:11-0:38:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:38:11):**  Like what's the because I don't think you're going to invest anytime soon as we jump ventures  
**[0:38:15-0:38:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:38:15):**  or at least the first fund in in a buffalo herd.  
**[0:38:18-0:38:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:38:18):**  But are there things exciting for you in that animal protein space that could be could be  
**[0:38:24-0:38:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:38:24):**  interesting at some point for VC fund looking at the technology, like the implementation  
**[0:38:30-0:38:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:38:30):**  of technology with regenerative practices?  
**[0:38:32-0:38:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:38:32):**  Well, I think I think some of the interesting technology is the technology that sort of  
**[0:38:38-0:38:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:38:38):**  proves the model out that if you look at, you know, the cow ranch next door to the,  
**[0:38:43-0:38:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:38:43):**  you know, to the ranch that's that's letting buffalo do their their natural thing and roam  
**[0:38:49-0:38:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:38:49):**  around and, you know, help till the soil with their with their hooves and things.  
**[0:38:55-0:39:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:38:55):**  You know, if you if you look at that from a rigorous soil testing method, the the buffalo  
**[0:39:05-0:39:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:39:05):**  ranch is going to sequester more carbon, it's going to create a healthier ecosystem, and  
**[0:39:10-0:39:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:39:10):**  it's going to be better for, you know, weather and climate resistance and resilience.  
**[0:39:18-0:39:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:39:18):**  And I think those are the kinds of things that like technology can help define and create  
**[0:39:24-0:39:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:39:24):**  markets for whether they're carbon markets or, you know, other ways of exchanging carbon  
**[0:39:30-0:39:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:39:30):**  carbon credit.  
**[0:39:31-0:39:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:39:31):**  And I think it's an it's there's there's a lot there.  
**[0:39:35-0:39:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:39:35):**  There's more than I'm sure we haven't even seen yet.  
**[0:39:37-0:39:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:39:37):**  But those are the kinds of projects that I think are interesting.  
**[0:39:41-0:39:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:39:41):**  And if you would be in charge of like, let's say you've raised a billion dollars, or let's  
**[0:39:46-0:39:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:39:46):**  say a large, large amount doesn't have to be only early stage VC, like it could be the  
**[0:39:49-0:39:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:39:49):**  full suite, because I know, then at some point, I mean, there's there are definitely ideas  
**[0:39:55-0:39:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:39:55):**  to to make this a whole suite of funds and suite of approaches, etc.  
**[0:39:59-0:40:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:39:59):**  Like, what would you you do if you'll be in charge of a billion dollars there?  
**[0:40:03-0:40:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:40:03):**  I mean, there should be a return at some point, but it can be very, very long term if that's  
**[0:40:08-0:40:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:40:08):**  needed.  
**[0:40:09-0:40:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:40:09):**  But I'm asking this question to, to understand priorities, like where would you would you  
**[0:40:13-0:40:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:40:13):**  focus this amount of resources and this amount of energy at the end, because money is energy?  
**[0:40:19-0:40:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:40:19):**  And if you if you would be in control of that, let's say tomorrow morning?  
**[0:40:25-0:40:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:40:25):**  Well, that's, that's something that deserves more thought than a, you know, than a couple  
**[0:40:29-0:40:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:40:29):**  of minutes on the podcast.  
**[0:40:30-0:40:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:40:30):**  But I would say that there are certain areas that are really critical, right.  
**[0:40:35-0:40:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:40:35):**  And one of those one of those areas is the fact that a lot of farmers don't own the land  
**[0:40:43-0:40:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:40:43):**  that they that they're farming, it's leased.  
**[0:40:46-0:40:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:40:46):**  And and and there are all kinds of, you know, difficulties for farmers to actually finance  
**[0:40:53-0:41:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:40:53):**  the transitions that they need from chemical agriculture, monocrop agriculture to regenerative  
**[0:41:00-0:41:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:41:00):**  agriculture, and and start to begin to move that meter to building topsoil rather than  
**[0:41:07-0:41:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:41:07):**  destroying it.  
**[0:41:08-0:41:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:41:08):**  So I think, I think working on that, the financing mechanisms for that transition is very important  
**[0:41:15-0:41:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:41:15):**  because it's a multi year transition.  
**[0:41:18-0:41:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:41:18):**  I also think, you know, this cleanly produced this plant, plant based protein is very important  
**[0:41:25-0:41:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:41:25):**  for the future, because, you know, if we were feeding everyone the American diet, why we'd  
**[0:41:31-0:41:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:41:31):**  blow out all of our planetary boundaries, right.  
**[0:41:34-0:41:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:41:34):**  So that that's not the way to go.  
**[0:41:37-0:41:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:41:37):**  You know, besides the large amount of diabetes and other, you know, medical issues that we  
**[0:41:42-0:41:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:41:42):**  have in the US.  
**[0:41:43-0:41:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:41:43):**  So you know, I think that's that's important.  
**[0:41:47-0:41:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:41:47):**  I think this this pasture, pastured animals done correctly.  
**[0:41:51-0:41:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:41:51):**  I think that's that's an interesting space and, you know, innovation needed there.  
**[0:41:57-0:42:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:41:57):**  And and, you know, and I think there's there's a lot that could be done there in an interesting  
**[0:42:02-0:42:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:42:02):**  way.  
**[0:42:03-0:42:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:42:03):**  And I also think, you know, financing the transition through these, you know, carbon  
**[0:42:07-0:42:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:42:07):**  markets and measurement tools and the science that we really need to know.  
**[0:42:12-0:42:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:42:12):**  It's not, you know, what we've had in the past, which is these big, big chemical companies  
**[0:42:17-0:42:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:42:17):**  or big food companies that just, you know, own these agricultural schools and basically  
**[0:42:21-0:42:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:42:21):**  tell them what to, you know, report.  
**[0:42:24-0:42:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:42:24):**  Yeah.  
**[0:42:25-0:42:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:42:25):**  And so the truth of what's actually going on.  
**[0:42:28-0:42:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:42:28):**  So we need, you know, more more sort of interesting citizen science and collaborative science.  
**[0:42:35-0:42:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:42:35):**  And I think we're at a really critical juncture as a species.  
**[0:42:38-0:42:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:42:38):**  You know, we're either going to choose life and innovation and health and learn to live  
**[0:42:43-0:42:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:42:43):**  with nature instead of destroying her.  
**[0:42:45-0:42:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:42:45):**  Or we're going to go the way of the dinosaur.  
**[0:42:48-0:42:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:42:48):**  And I'm not willing to give up yet.  
**[0:42:50-0:42:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:42:50):**  You know, I have hope we can tip the scale towards a more righteous future.  
**[0:42:55-0:43:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:42:55):**  And on the clean, on the plant based one and the clean label, like what needs to happen  
**[0:43:01-0:43:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:43:01):**  there?  
**[0:43:02-0:43:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:43:02):**  Because it feels like the solutions that are currently on the market and getting a lot  
**[0:43:06-0:43:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:43:06):**  of attention also get a lot of criticism from the ingredient side, from the labeling side,  
**[0:43:12-0:43:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:43:12):**  because there are just too many things on the label, and maybe also from the taste side,  
**[0:43:15-0:43:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:43:15):**  to a certain extent, but simply the nutrition, the health.  
**[0:43:18-0:43:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:43:18):**  And also, you can make an argument that they're potentially worse, or at least equally bad,  
**[0:43:24-0:43:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:43:24):**  in terms of sourcing and where their ingredients come.  
**[0:43:27-0:43:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:43:27):**  I'm obviously talking about the GMO, soy, etc.  
**[0:43:30-0:43:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:43:30):**  Like what?  
**[0:43:31-0:43:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:43:31):**  Yeah.  
**[0:43:32-0:43:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:43:32):**  What do you see there?  
**[0:43:33-0:43:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:43:33):**  Is was it sort of a first generation?  
**[0:43:34-0:43:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:43:34):**  I mean, there were generations before and now we're thinking, okay, we actually I mean,  
**[0:43:37-0:43:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:43:37):**  it's not just plant based is not not good enough.  
**[0:43:39-0:43:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:43:39):**  We need to go a level beyond that, because otherwise, we just replace one crap with the  
**[0:43:44-0:43:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:43:44):**  other crap, which is not really helpful.  
**[0:43:46-0:43:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:43:46):**  Yeah, I totally agree.  
**[0:43:48-0:43:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:43:48):**  I mean, that's why I'm really excited about meaty because it's a very short ingredient  
**[0:43:52-0:43:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:43:52):**  list.  
**[0:43:53-0:44:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:43:53):**  It's using fermentation, and it's using something that is basically mushroom root mycelium based.  
**[0:44:00-0:44:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:44:00):**  And it's it's it's very good on the gut.  
**[0:44:02-0:44:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:44:02):**  It's not trying to create, you know, something that looks like meat that that's going to,  
**[0:44:08-0:44:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:44:08):**  you know, wreak havoc on your gut because it's got this long ingredient list.  
**[0:44:12-0:44:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:44:12):**  It's trying to create, you know, fat textures and stuff like that.  
**[0:44:15-0:44:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:44:15):**  You know, it's, it's, it's, it's more simple.  
**[0:44:18-0:44:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:44:18):**  And I think those are the kinds of solutions.  
**[0:44:20-0:44:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:44:20):**  How's the taste?  
**[0:44:21-0:44:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:44:21):**  I'm fascinated by them.  
**[0:44:22-0:44:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:44:22):**  Like what's the day you've tasted it for sure.  
**[0:44:24-0:44:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:44:24):**  Like, what's the taste?  
**[0:44:25-0:44:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:44:25):**  It's amazing.  
**[0:44:26-0:44:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:44:26):**  I mean, I wouldn't have gotten involved with the company if it didn't eat well.  
**[0:44:30-0:44:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:44:30):**  I mean, it's it's and it doesn't have I mean, I've always had issues with the other plant  
**[0:44:35-0:44:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:44:35):**  based meat companies and that it just didn't feel good in the gut afterward.  
**[0:44:38-0:44:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:44:38):**  And I learned that a lot of that has to do with both the fact that they're using a lot  
**[0:44:42-0:44:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:44:42):**  of GMO inputs, but that they're also trying to, you know, recreate, you know, meat textures  
**[0:44:48-0:44:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:44:48):**  and things like that.  
**[0:44:50-0:44:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:44:50):**  You know, mycelium root, mushroom root kind of already has a meaty texture to it.  
**[0:44:55-0:44:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:44:55):**  So it's it's it tastes very good.  
**[0:44:58-0:45:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:44:58):**  And it's a beautiful center of the plate product.  
**[0:45:00-0:45:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:45:00):**  And it's doing it's it's doing very well.  
**[0:45:03-0:45:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:45:03):**  And I'm, you know, just really excited to see that brand.  
**[0:45:09-0:45:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:45:09):**  What does it use as a sort of ingredient?  
**[0:45:11-0:45:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:45:11):**  Sorry, what does it use as ingredient?  
**[0:45:13-0:45:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:45:13):**  What is it used to?  
**[0:45:14-0:45:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:45:14):**  I don't know grow to mycelium on I don't think honest the right word like in or like how  
**[0:45:18-0:45:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:45:18):**  does like what do you need to feed it?  
**[0:45:20-0:45:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:45:20):**  It's a fermentation.  
**[0:45:22-0:45:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:45:22):**  It's a fermentation process and you feed sugar to it essentially.  
**[0:45:26-0:45:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:45:26):**  And fermenting doesn't matter what kind of sugar it does.  
**[0:45:29-0:45:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:45:29):**  And I think I think sugar sources is an issue, right, because you want to get the best source,  
**[0:45:35-0:45:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:45:35):**  most responsibly sourced.  
**[0:45:37-0:45:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:45:37):**  So that's that's an issue that we you know, that we focus on as well in the supply chain  
**[0:45:41-0:45:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:45:41):**  there.  
**[0:45:42-0:45:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:45:42):**  Yeah, because otherwise, I mean, the sugar industry has has some issues as well, not  
**[0:45:46-0:45:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:45:46):**  just because of the sugar, but also because of the growing practices there.  
**[0:45:51-0:45:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:45:51):**  For sure.  
**[0:45:52-0:45:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:45:52):**  And so that's very interesting.  
**[0:45:53-0:45:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:45:53):**  I mean, the fermentation part, obviously, is very interesting.  
**[0:45:55-0:46:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:45:55):**  And do you see a lot of other innovations there in a sense like that used is not trying  
**[0:46:01-0:46:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:46:01):**  to fake meat, but actually trying to grow a product that is a center plate, as you mentioned,  
**[0:46:06-0:46:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:46:06):**  as they see or even more like, is that has that been happening because of all the backlash  
**[0:46:11-0:46:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:46:11):**  that obviously some some of the larger companies we've seen with a lot of marketing budget?  
**[0:46:16-0:46:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:46:16):**  Like, do you see a lot of innovation in there?  
**[0:46:19-0:46:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:46:19):**  Would you love to see more?  
**[0:46:22-0:46:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:46:22):**  I think we're going to have to see more innovation on and we're seeing it already with with,  
**[0:46:28-0:46:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:46:28):**  you know, protein being added into into products, right?  
**[0:46:33-0:46:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:46:33):**  Because people want to have a higher protein diet or get the amount of protein that they  
**[0:46:37-0:46:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:46:37):**  that they need in a day and they don't want to do that by just eating, you know, by just  
**[0:46:42-0:46:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:46:42):**  eating animal meat.  
**[0:46:44-0:46:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:46:44):**  And so we're seeing that but I think that's a wide open field.  
**[0:46:47-0:46:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:46:47):**  I mean, one thing one thing I learned about the food industry, you know, starting Patagonia's  
**[0:46:53-0:46:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:46:53):**  food business is that, you know, innovation should not be about, you know, adding new  
**[0:46:59-0:47:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:46:59):**  flavors and that kind of thing, right?  
**[0:47:03-0:47:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:47:03):**  Innovation should really be about the future of food, you know, and I think very few big  
**[0:47:07-0:47:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:47:07):**  companies think that way, which is why they end up, you know, buying these innovative  
**[0:47:12-0:47:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:47:12):**  smaller companies because they just don't have that capability in house.  
**[0:47:17-0:47:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:47:17):**  Like, well, it's an interesting because we've talked about the CPG side and how it can really  
**[0:47:22-0:47:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:47:22):**  unlock interesting returns, but also unlock, I think a lot of farmer like potential for  
**[0:47:27-0:47:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:47:27):**  farmers to to find supply or to find a ways to to sell their regeneratively grown almonds,  
**[0:47:34-0:47:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:47:34):**  etc, etc.  
**[0:47:35-0:47:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:47:35):**  And yet, on the $1 billion question, you said you didn't mention, okay, well, let's invest  
**[0:47:41-0:47:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:47:41):**  in a lot of the startup food companies to do it.  
**[0:47:43-0:47:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:47:43):**  Is that deliberate or do you see less opportunity there?  
**[0:47:48-0:47:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:47:48):**  Or maybe it's more crowded and like, because we know organic exits were good, like this  
**[0:47:53-0:47:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:47:53):**  space will attract like new new bars and new food companies?  
**[0:47:58-0:48:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:47:58):**  Or is that has been something you haven't focused on too much?  
**[0:48:01-0:48:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:48:01):**  No, I think I think that the change a lot of the change will happen.  
**[0:48:07-0:48:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:48:07):**  I mean, I mentioned plant based because I think protein is so important and sources  
**[0:48:11-0:48:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:48:11):**  of protein are so important as we look look to the future.  
**[0:48:14-0:48:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:48:14):**  And like I said, this issue of using animal based proteins would kind of blow out the  
**[0:48:20-0:48:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:48:20):**  planetary boundaries to the extreme.  
**[0:48:22-0:48:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:48:22):**  Really quickly.  
**[0:48:23-0:48:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:48:23):**  Yeah.  
**[0:48:24-0:48:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:48:24):**  Yeah.  
**[0:48:25-0:48:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:48:25):**  Especially with this CAFO model.  
**[0:48:26-0:48:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:48:26):**  Right.  
**[0:48:27-0:48:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:48:27):**  It's really terrible.  
**[0:48:28-0:48:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:48:28):**  It's really bad for the environment.  
**[0:48:29-0:48:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:48:29):**  So.  
**[0:48:30-0:48:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:48:30):**  So I mentioned I mentioned plant based, but I also believe that there will be innovative  
**[0:48:34-0:48:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:48:34):**  products, right, that people will and they'll win by being the best product.  
**[0:48:39-0:48:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:48:39):**  You know, the win by being the most delicious, nutritious product.  
**[0:48:44-0:48:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:48:44):**  And you know, you've talked a lot, I know, about nutrient density.  
**[0:48:49-0:48:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:48:49):**  And that's also an important factor for people now.  
**[0:48:52-0:48:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:48:52):**  And I really I really do think that there is a huge change happening where people are  
**[0:48:56-0:48:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:48:56):**  people are unhappy with their health care.  
**[0:48:58-0:49:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:48:58):**  You know, they're starting to take it into their own hands and they're starting to be  
**[0:49:01-0:49:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:49:01):**  technology that's helping them to do that.  
**[0:49:03-0:49:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:49:03):**  So I'm excited about that.  
**[0:49:05-0:49:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:49:05):**  I think there's a whole huge opportunity there in both, you know, transforming food systems  
**[0:49:11-0:49:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:49:11):**  and health care.  
**[0:49:13-0:49:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:49:13):**  And there's there's just a lot there.  
**[0:49:15-0:49:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:49:15):**  Have you made investments like in that, like in the health care food space, let's say,  
**[0:49:20-0:49:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:49:20):**  or are you looking at things?  
**[0:49:21-0:49:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:49:21):**  I mean, obviously only if you can share.  
**[0:49:23-0:49:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:49:23):**  But have you done any any deals there?  
**[0:49:28-0:49:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:49:28):**  Not not not in that particular space.  
**[0:49:33-0:49:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:49:33):**  But you know, you would like to are looking at we're we're definitely, you know, talking  
**[0:49:39-0:49:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:49:39):**  to companies that are they're looking at that space.  
**[0:49:41-0:49:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:49:41):**  I think a lot of a lot of folks are I mean, it's going to be huge as people begin to be  
**[0:49:47-0:49:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:49:47):**  able to take more control over their metabolic health.  
**[0:49:52-0:49:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:49:52):**  And then as a final question, it never is the final question.  
**[0:49:55-0:50:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:49:55):**  But if you could change one thing overnight, so you don't have your $1 billion fund anymore,  
**[0:50:01-0:50:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:50:01):**  I'm sorry, but you do have a magic wand and you have the unlimited power to change one  
**[0:50:05-0:50:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:50:05):**  thing and one thing only.  
**[0:50:07-0:50:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:50:07):**  What what would that be?  
**[0:50:10-0:50:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:50:10):**  I think it would be to abolish all forms of chemical agriculture.  
**[0:50:16-0:50:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:50:16):**  Simply make it illegal or simply like what would that process?  
**[0:50:19-0:50:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:50:19):**  Regulate it out of existence, you know, regulate very quickly.  
**[0:50:24-0:50:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:50:24):**  How quick?  
**[0:50:25-0:50:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:50:25):**  Okay, we do it.  
**[0:50:26-0:50:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:50:26):**  If I could wave a magic wand, I would do it right now.  
**[0:50:31-0:50:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:50:31):**  Yeah.  
**[0:50:32-0:50:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:50:32):**  I mean, it's a tough one because it's like, would you do that?  
**[0:50:35-0:50:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:50:35):**  Or would you get rid of all the CAFOs in the in the world?  
**[0:50:38-0:50:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:50:38):**  All the subsidies could be Yeah.  
**[0:50:40-0:50:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:50:40):**  Yeah, I know.  
**[0:50:42-0:50:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:50:42):**  It's I mean, but maybe if you get rid of chemical agriculture, there won't be this immense surplus  
**[0:50:47-0:50:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:50:47):**  subsidized obviously of a fee that could easily go to CAFOs and thus take also take out take  
**[0:50:53-0:50:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:50:53):**  away their business model, which in a in a in a true cost accounting world obviously  
**[0:50:57-0:50:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:50:57):**  wouldn't exist.  
**[0:50:58-0:51:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:50:58):**  And in an unsubsidized world, I'm betting that it wouldn't exist either.  
**[0:51:04-0:51:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:51:04):**  So maybe if you take away the feed, also that model doesn't doesn't have any legs anymore.  
**[0:51:09-0:51:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:51:09):**  Yeah.  
**[0:51:11-0:51:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:51:11):**  So that would be the big, the big change and anything you're particularly excited, I mean,  
**[0:51:17-0:51:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:51:17):**  where it seems to be that we're going into a hot literally, but like autumn and obviously  
**[0:51:22-0:51:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:51:22):**  winter like things you look forward to over the next let's say six months or so from from  
**[0:51:27-0:51:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:51:27):**  the venture side from region ventures like what's what I want to keep you up at night  
**[0:51:31-0:51:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:51:31):**  but what's exciting you over the over the next month?  
**[0:51:34-0:51:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:51:34):**  We should definitely check into like say if we're talking a year or two years to see Okay,  
**[0:51:38-0:51:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:51:38):**  what's what's brewing there?  
**[0:51:40-0:51:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:51:40):**  Well, I think what's exciting is we've we've deployed, we've deployed a portion of our  
**[0:51:48-0:51:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:51:48):**  fund, but we still have a lot of capital left to deploy and there's so much exciting.  
**[0:51:55-0:52:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:51:55):**  There's so much exciting stuff happening in both, you know, in food and technology and  
**[0:52:02-0:52:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:52:02):**  in in soil health and in all of these different areas that I just feel like we're really positioned  
**[0:52:09-0:52:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:52:09):**  to pick those regenerative technology companies that that really have the capability to scale  
**[0:52:17-0:52:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:52:17):**  and we're seeing, you know, we're seeing the beginnings of that in these early stage companies  
**[0:52:20-0:52:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:52:20):**  that we're investing in and I just I just see the impact that that the fund can have  
**[0:52:27-0:52:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:52:27):**  as being, you know, having great returns, but just just having really significant environmental  
**[0:52:32-0:52:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:52:32):**  impact which is which is what we're we're shooting for.  
**[0:52:35-0:52:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:52:35):**  And I don't see those things as mutually exclusive, you know, and I ran a business where, you  
**[0:52:41-0:52:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:52:41):**  know, we were very profitable and very successful but we also were very mindful and supportive  
**[0:52:51-0:52:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:52:51):**  of planetary health and advocacy and and those are the companies that I think will win in  
**[0:52:57-0:53:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:52:57):**  the next generation and those are the companies that will be on our lips.  
**[0:53:02-0:53:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:53:02):**  It won't be Pepsi and Chevron and you know the companies we grew up with or I grew up  
**[0:53:08-0:53:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:53:08):**  with probably.  
**[0:53:11-0:53:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:53:11):**  I think it's an interesting point.  
**[0:53:12-0:53:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:53:12):**  I mean, and that's also a very fundamental piece I think of the Patagonia journey that  
**[0:53:17-0:53:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:53:17):**  it never got sold or at least I think it never even got investment capital outside capital  
**[0:53:22-0:53:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:53:22):**  to a certain extent and maybe it didn't need that in that timeframe like now we are living  
**[0:53:27-0:53:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:53:27):**  in different times of course, but it had this sort of long organic growth and of course  
**[0:53:32-0:53:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:53:32):**  hyperscale at some point but it really only had to serve the goals it set and not necessarily  
**[0:53:41-0:53:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:53:41):**  Wall Street or something because I don't know if that journey would have been the same over  
**[0:53:45-0:53:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:53:45):**  40, 50 or whatever the number is years.  
**[0:53:47-0:53:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:53:47):**  There will be some crisis potentially.  
**[0:53:49-0:53:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:53:49):**  So there's something to learn there potentially as well but also raise the question what happens  
**[0:53:53-0:53:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:53:53):**  with the next generation?  
**[0:53:54-0:53:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:53:54):**  I mean, nobody has eternal life and even neither like what will happen?  
**[0:53:59-0:54:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:53:59):**  I mean, for sure plans are in place but how can it live on and have the enormous impact  
**[0:54:04-0:54:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:54:04):**  it had also many decades from now?  
**[0:54:07-0:54:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:54:07):**  Yeah, well, I'm not the CEO anymore.  
**[0:54:10-0:54:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:54:10):**  I can't really answer that question but I do think that the benefit corporation structure  
**[0:54:16-0:54:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:54:16):**  is helpful in that secession conversation because like I said, it does enshrine the  
**[0:54:22-0:54:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:54:22):**  values of the company into the company's charter and so you know what those values are and  
**[0:54:32-0:54:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:54:32):**  they're very explicit.  
**[0:54:33-0:54:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:54:33):**  So, but yeah, I don't have a crystal ball of what will happen in the future there.  
**[0:54:37-0:54:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:54:37):**  And do you see like, has it changed in terms of the amount of entrepreneurs you've seen  
**[0:54:42-0:54:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:54:42):**  with this deep tech and deep regeneration focus over the last couple of years?  
**[0:54:46-0:54:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:54:46):**  Like you say, we see sort of this growth now, I'm very excited.  
**[0:54:49-0:54:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:54:49):**  We have quite a bit of dry powder left, which is great because we see deals has that shifted  
**[0:54:54-0:54:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:54:54):**  as the change since your time with with region ventures or has it been always quite a good  
**[0:54:59-0:55:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:54:59):**  amount?  
**[0:55:00-0:55:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:55:00):**  No, I think it's like sort of a renaissance, you know, and I think part of that is that  
**[0:55:06-0:55:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:55:06):**  a lot of these founders are digitally native, right?  
**[0:55:10-0:55:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:55:10):**  I mean, they grew up in a digital world and that we did not or I did not with a lot of  
**[0:55:19-0:55:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:55:19):**  information at their fingertips and a lot of technical knowledge and with idealism of  
**[0:55:24-0:55:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:55:24):**  wanting to apply that to the world and they are vocal, they are active, they are, you  
**[0:55:35-0:55:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:55:35):**  know, coming up with innovations.  
**[0:55:37-0:55:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:55:37):**  Can some of them become like the Patagonia of our time but in the regeneration space?  
**[0:55:43-0:55:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:55:43):**  Without question, I think.  
**[0:55:44-0:55:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:55:44):**  I think what we want is not just one more Patagonia like company, we want many, right?  
**[0:55:50-0:55:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:55:50):**  That's what we're shooting for.  
**[0:55:51-0:55:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:55:51):**  We need many of these unicorns, yeah.  
**[0:55:52-0:55:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:55:52):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:55:53-0:55:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:55:53):**  Well, we don't need that.  
**[0:55:55-0:56:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:55:55):**  We don't want them to be unicorns, you know, we want to have a full herd of them.  
**[0:56:01-0:56:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:56:01):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:56:02-0:56:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:56:02):**  I want to thank you so much for your time, Rose, and for sharing, of course, for the  
**[0:56:07-0:56:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:56:07):**  work you do and the fact that you didn't go and retire and but actually get your hands  
**[0:56:12-0:56:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:56:12):**  dirty and do a lot of work after, I think, an immense 12 years that also took its toll  
**[0:56:19-0:56:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:56:19):**  or was definitely a roller coaster ride.  
**[0:56:21-0:56:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:56:21):**  So I want to thank you for the work you do in this space and, of course, showing up here  
**[0:56:26-0:56:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:56:26):**  and share about it.

**[0:57:19-0:57:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:57:19):**  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[0:57:23-0:57:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:57:23):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  
**[0:57:27-0:57:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:57:27):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[0:57:29-0:57:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:57:29):**  After 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question how to put money  
**[0:57:33-0:57:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:57:33):**  to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011 and recording  
**[0:57:38-0:57:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:57:38):**  these podcasts since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.

**[0:58:01-0:58:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:58:01):**  For whom is this course?  
**[0:58:03-0:58:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:58:03):**  You, the soil builders and investors in this space.  
**[0:58:06-0:58:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:58:06):**  The soil builders, people working in this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers,  
**[0:58:10-0:58:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:58:10):**  vehicle builders, crowd investing, platform builders, ag tech companies, farm to gut food  
**[0:58:15-0:58:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:58:15):**  companies, permaculture, key line designers, holistic management consultants, etc.  
**[0:58:20-0:58:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:58:20):**  People that are building soil at scale.  
**[0:58:23-0:58:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:58:23):**  And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office  
**[0:58:26-0:58:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:58:26):**  or as private individuals or people who are putting other people's money to work through  
**[0:58:30-0:58:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:58:30):**  foundations, institutional capital, banks, insurance companies, etc.  
**[0:58:35-0:58:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:58:35):**  Is this course free?  
**[0:58:36-0:58:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:58:36):**  No.  
**[0:58:37-0:58:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:58:37):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:58:39-0:58:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:58:39):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you and I'm very aware  
**[0:58:44-0:58:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:58:44):**  that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very different means.  
**[0:58:49-0:58:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:58:49):**  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[0:58:54-0:58:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:58:54):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[0:58:57-0:58:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:58:57):**  Thank you.  
**[0:58:58-0:58:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:58:58):**  So what is this course?  
**[0:58:59-0:59:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:58:59):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  
**[0:59:06-0:59:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:59:06):**  so you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:59:07-0:59:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:59:07):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:59:12-0:59:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:59:12):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:59:18-0:59:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:59:18):**  invest in and what kind of co investors you could find or what kind of investors you could  
**[0:59:22-0:59:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:59:22):**  find if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:59:24-0:59:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:59:24):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:59:29-0:59:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:59:29):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:59:33-0:59:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:59:33):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:59:38-0:59:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:59:38):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:59:39-0:59:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:59:39):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:59:41-0:59:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:59:41):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:59:43-0:59:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:59:43):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:59:47-0:59:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:59:47):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:59:49-0:59:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:59:49):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.  
**[0:59:54-0:59:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/rose-marcario#t=0:59:54):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking.

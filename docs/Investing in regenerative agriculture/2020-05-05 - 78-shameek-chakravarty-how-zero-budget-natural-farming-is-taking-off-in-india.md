**[0:01:11-0:01:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:01:11):**  And why regenerative agriculture is by far the most interesting place to start carbon  
**[0:01:15-0:01:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:01:15):**  removal and storage now, but it isn't enough.

**[0:01:31-0:01:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:01:31):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:01:36-0:01:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:01:36):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:01:41):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:43-0:01:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:01:43):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:47-0:01:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:01:47):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:01:49):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:54-0:01:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:01:54):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.

**[0:02:27-0:02:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:02:27):**  So much has happened but their mission is still the same, providing high quality organic  
**[0:02:32-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:02:32):**  produce from zero budget natural farms to people living in the larger Indian cities.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:02:37):**  Join me in this episode where we discuss the status of zero budget natural farming in India,  
**[0:02:43-0:02:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:02:43):**  the issues and opportunities of organic and the appetite of investors for this type of  
**[0:02:47-0:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:02:47):**  farming.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:02:49):**  So welcome to this update.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:02:50):**  Welcome Shamik back on the show after two years actually because when we recorded our  
**[0:02:55-0:02:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:02:55):**  first interview it was November 2017.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:02:57):**  So I'm super interested to hear what has happened at Farmazon, what has happened in the region  
**[0:03:03-0:03:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:03:03):**  egg space in India and what has happened in general with you.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:03:08):**  Right.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:03:09):**  So great to hear from you, Koen and happy to be back here.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:03:12):**  So yeah, it's been quite a bit of time but it's also passed by very fast for us.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:03:17):**  So I think in November when we had spoken we had just like launched our second farm  
**[0:03:23-0:03:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:03:23):**  or something like that if I remember correctly.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:03:26):**  And then we went ahead and launched several partner farms just to refresh the model that  
**[0:03:32-0:03:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:03:32):**  we had started with would let consumers to contract farming.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:03:36):**  A group of consumers could basically have a farmer grow all of their food for them.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:03:43):**  And we used to divide each farm into small mini farms and each mini farm would be allocated  
**[0:03:48-0:03:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:03:48):**  to a particular person.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:03:49):**  That's how it used to operate.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:03:52):**  So we went ahead and launched several mini farms.  
**[0:03:55-0:04:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:03:55):**  We also launched in outside Bangalore as well because one of the concerns that we always  
**[0:04:00-0:04:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:04:00):**  had was is this something which is very specific to the agro climatic zone in Bangalore.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:04:05):**  And Bangalore has a very moderate sort of a climate compared to a lot of parts of India  
**[0:04:10-0:04:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:04:10):**  which lets us grow stuff pretty much all throughout the year, lots of variety.  
**[0:04:14-0:04:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:04:14):**  So we were worried how is this going to work out in more harsher climate for example with  
**[0:04:20-0:04:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:04:20):**  the water work.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:04:21):**  So we really wanted to try North India because North India does have much harsher climate  
**[0:04:26-0:04:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:04:26):**  in certain areas in places like Delhi for example.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:04:29):**  But that would have been quite far right.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:04:32):**  We wanted to do it in an area which has a different climate but which was still nearby.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:04:36):**  So we chose Hyderabad to do that.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:04:38):**  So we have some farms running in Hyderabad as well now.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:04:42):**  I think we have about 25 or farms now running across Bangalore and Hyderabad.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:04:49):**  So we learned a bunch of different things.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:04:51):**  So I think one of the things that we learned was that this sort of a model can work in  
**[0:04:55-0:05:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:04:55):**  other sort of geographies as well because what happens is that even in places which  
**[0:05:01-0:05:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:05:01):**  has slightly harsher weather or where the varieties that could grow are smaller in number,  
**[0:05:07-0:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:05:07):**  agriculture has still kind of taken care that there is enough nutrition in stuff that grows  
**[0:05:12-0:05:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:05:12):**  seasonally and locally there.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:05:15):**  Yeah of course somebody who's in Bangalore might have access to more variety right.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:05:20):**  But somebody in Hyderabad still has a lot of different vegetables that they could get  
**[0:05:24-0:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:05:24):**  which grow in that particular area, that particular season and so on and so forth.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:05:28):**  So the model works across multiple geographies.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:05:30):**  That's something that we learned right.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:05:33):**  However, having said that, I think we also, so that was a good part of it.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:05:37):**  The second thing that we realized was that we kind of, we have now made it a very standardized  
**[0:05:42-0:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:05:42):**  playbook.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:05:43):**  So once we identify a partner by basically visiting his farm, seeing the location, how  
**[0:05:49-0:05:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:05:49):**  near and accessible is it from the city, it takes a very little time to actually get started.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:05:59):**  Having said that, I think I just mentioned that being near to the city is important and  
**[0:06:03-0:06:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:06:03):**  this is something that we saw happen as well that the nearer it is to the city, the more  
**[0:06:10-0:06:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:06:10):**  interest from consumers.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:06:13):**  So that's something to keep in mind.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:06:14):**  Now I think the third thing that we have learned is that, so we made some changes to the model  
**[0:06:21-0:06:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:06:21):**  also right.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:06:22):**  So there are two or three different flavors which are available right now.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:06:26):**  So one of the changes that we did to the model was we said, okay, what if, so right now in  
**[0:06:35-0:06:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:06:35):**  our original model, every consumer gets a 600 feet mini farm where they do all of their  
**[0:06:41-0:06:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:06:41):**  stuff.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:06:42):**  What if instead of that, we let the farmer manage everything right?  
**[0:06:47-0:06:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:06:47):**  Because we saw that a lot of consumers as part of the learning process in farming were  
**[0:06:52-0:06:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:06:52):**  making mistakes in terms of what they should be growing, how they should be planning right.  
**[0:06:57-0:07:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:06:57):**  So although we build some stuff into the app to help with that planning etc.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:07:00):**  Yeah, the gamification we discussed.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:07:03):**  Yeah, so consumers would make mistakes like, for example, the system would recommend, hey,  
**[0:07:08-0:07:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:07:08):**  do crop rotation, don't put that same crop in.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:07:11):**  And you would see consumers still go ahead and put another crop of the same family in  
**[0:07:15-0:07:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:07:15):**  right and some of those sort of things.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:07:17):**  So what we said was, let's do a method where, let's try out in at least one farm, let's  
**[0:07:24-0:07:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:07:24):**  try out a model where the farmer does everything for you right and you basically have a common  
**[0:07:30-0:07:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:07:30):**  pool completely right.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:07:32):**  So the entire farm still supplies people but the way it works is that consumers kind of  
**[0:07:38-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:07:38):**  vote with their preferences.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:07:40):**  So consumers say that I like these veggies, I hate these veggies right.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:07:45):**  So they basically put a love list and a hate list okay.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:07:49):**  And the farmer basically in his app, he sees all of these different votes from people on  
**[0:07:54-0:08:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:07:54):**  an ongoing basis and he uses that information to decide his crop planning right.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:08:00):**  And he actually does the entire crop planning in the entire farm.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:08:03):**  This is of course more efficient from a labor perspective.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:08:06):**  But what we saw was that in that model, although the overall yield etc. were better and the  
**[0:08:12-0:08:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:08:12):**  farmers effort was lower right because it's less labor intensive, it's more optimized.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:08:17):**  But very few consumers were actually visiting the farm.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:08:20):**  So which kind of like see along with giving consumers access to safe traceable food, one  
**[0:08:27-0:08:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:08:27):**  of the things that you really want to achieve with this business is to get people back in  
**[0:08:32-0:08:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:08:32):**  touch with their roots, understand farming from both its ups and downs perspective right.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:08:38):**  And that was getting missed out a lot because very few people would actually go ahead and  
**[0:08:42-0:08:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:08:42):**  visit those farms.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:08:43):**  So we call this the shared farm model.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:08:46):**  So on one extreme was mini farm, another extreme was shared farms where you still have 600  
**[0:08:52-0:08:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:08:52):**  square feet, but it is not one particular area of the land.  
**[0:08:56-0:08:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:08:56):**  And why do you think that is?  
**[0:08:58-0:08:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:08:58):**  Why didn't they visit anymore?  
**[0:08:59-0:09:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:08:59):**  Yeah because I think somehow this sense that this particular patch really belongs to me  
**[0:09:05-0:09:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:09:05):**  right, is appeals more to people than saying okay there is this whole commons which belongs  
**[0:09:12-0:09:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:09:12):**  to everybody.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:09:13):**  You know I mean it's a interesting human psychology at play here at least in the segments that  
**[0:09:20-0:09:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:09:20):**  we work in.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:09:21):**  So that's what we saw because I guess it's like this right, if you come and work on your  
**[0:09:27-0:09:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:09:27):**  patch of the land right.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:09:28):**  It's actually very interesting to think about this because this is kind of like you know  
**[0:09:36-0:09:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:09:36):**  I mean I can think of how this has similarities with various different types of economic systems  
**[0:09:42-0:09:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:09:42):**  in the world for example right.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:09:44):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:09:45):**  Maybe this is like capitalism versus socialism right.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:09:49):**  In terms of you know everybody owns the resource so nobody is really responsible for it or  
**[0:09:53-0:09:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:09:53):**  nobody keeps very proud about if something does very well whereas if you have your own  
**[0:09:58-0:10:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:09:58):**  thing you feel like oh this is my own thing let me go and put in some more effort in it.  
**[0:10:03-0:10:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:10:03):**  You know maybe show off how good it is and things like that.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:10:06):**  So I think some of these interesting dynamics I'm not a good human psychology specialist  
**[0:10:12-0:10:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:10:12):**  so I don't really can't really articulate on that but that's what we see.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:10:18):**  So we then also came up with a third model where we said okay you know what let us try  
**[0:10:27-0:10:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:10:27):**  if there's the best of both worlds approach that we could do right.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:10:31):**  Where we said we call that model the half and half model and so far this seems to be  
**[0:10:36-0:10:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:10:36):**  the best from consumer reviews everything perspective this seems to be the best which  
**[0:10:41-0:10:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:10:41):**  is that basically you have half of the patch of land you control your own patch that you  
**[0:10:48-0:10:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:10:48):**  have six beds and the remaining pieces as a part of a large common area that the farmer  
**[0:10:53-0:10:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:10:53):**  manages.  
**[0:10:54-0:11:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:10:54):**  So you get the benefit of good yield etc right and you don't really end up messing up everything  
**[0:11:00-0:11:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:11:00):**  in your patch of land by making wrong decisions.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:11:03):**  At the same time you have enough place to learn experiment make mistakes and learn from  
**[0:11:08-0:11:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:11:08):**  it right.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:11:09):**  So that's kind of like a so the half and half model is very interesting because it helps  
**[0:11:13-0:11:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:11:13):**  you basically make sure that you are getting enough vegetables enough variety at the same  
**[0:11:17-0:11:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:11:17):**  time you have this whole thing about you know the actions that you are taking on the app  
**[0:11:24-0:11:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:11:24):**  has some real implications right.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:11:27):**  So based on what we have seen so far the half and half model is the best right.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:11:32):**  So this has been one side of the story but two years is quite a long time.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:11:37):**  So the other thing that we also realized was that while this model is quite interesting  
**[0:11:42-0:11:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:11:42):**  and we are seeing a bunch of subscribers sign up etc when we talk to a lot of our subscribers  
**[0:11:48-0:11:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:11:48):**  right and you ask them why did you sign up right what is your expectation.  
**[0:11:54-0:12:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:11:54):**  So what it turns out is that out of all of the subscribers maybe 10 to 20 percent of  
**[0:12:01-0:12:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:12:01):**  them have signed up because of this experience because they can build up connect with a farmer  
**[0:12:06-0:12:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:12:06):**  and all of those things.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:12:08):**  80 percent plus consumers have actually signed up because they found this a trustworthy source  
**[0:12:14-0:12:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:12:14):**  of food.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:12:15):**  That's pretty much it.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:12:19):**  They are not really looking at let me learn a little bit more about farming or let me  
**[0:12:25-0:12:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:12:25):**  you know contribute something back to the soil that's not the reason it's basically  
**[0:12:29-0:12:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:12:29):**  I am getting food which I can trust which I know has been grown without chemicals the  
**[0:12:33-0:12:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:12:33):**  other options that are there in the market for whatever reason I'm not able to trust.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:12:37):**  So that was one reason.  
**[0:12:39-0:12:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:12:39):**  The second reason is because of the very low very short supply chain our produce is usually  
**[0:12:46-0:12:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:12:46):**  a much more fresher than most of the other things that you find in the market right because  
**[0:12:49-0:12:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:12:49):**  these are farmed extremely near the city they are harvested on the same day and it gets  
**[0:12:54-0:12:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:12:54):**  delivered to you like within just a few hours of harvest right within five six hours of  
**[0:12:58-0:12:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:12:58):**  harvest you get it.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:12:59):**  So it's much fresher than if I were to go to let's say you know Amazon Fresh or whatever  
**[0:13:07-0:13:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:13:07):**  there's a e-grosser here called Big Basket if you go to all of those places typically  
**[0:13:11-0:13:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:13:11):**  the supply chain is much longer because it's an inventory led model right.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:13:15):**  I mean you will harvest your produce the day before that will come from let's say 100 200  
**[0:13:20-0:13:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:13:20):**  kilometers away it will stay in your warehouses get distributed to different hubs.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:13:24):**  So a lot of it changes a lot of hands number one.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:13:28):**  Number two it also have there's quite a bit of time which has elapsed before you actually  
**[0:13:33-0:13:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:13:33):**  get your so the produce is not as fresh as people would like to have it right.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:13:37):**  So what we saw was the two main reasons why 80 percent people are actually signed up is  
**[0:13:41-0:13:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:13:41):**  because a they get access to very very fresh food and b the food that they have access  
**[0:13:46-0:13:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:13:46):**  to has full traceability and hence they can trust it.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:13:50):**  Okay very interesting dynamic came into the picture which I don't know whether we talked  
**[0:13:54-0:14:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:13:54):**  about it last time or not is that when you talk about trust and traceability there are  
**[0:14:02-0:14:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:14:02):**  two aspects to it one aspect is what the let's say you are dealing with a company right and  
**[0:14:07-0:14:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:14:07):**  what the company says to you which helps you build trust right.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:14:11):**  It could be the brand it could be the communication it could be some of the information that you  
**[0:14:15-0:14:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:14:15):**  share saying it's from this farm etc right.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:14:18):**  The other way to build trust is basically where consumers end up trusting what others  
**[0:14:27-0:14:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:14:27):**  are telling them right.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:14:28):**  That's another way of building trust and that seems to be a little more powerful than a  
**[0:14:33-0:14:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:14:33):**  company going ahead and trying to build trust.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:14:35):**  So let me take an example and say so when we one of the very important mechanisms that  
**[0:14:41-0:14:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:14:41):**  we saw work really well at farmism was that not all of our consumers would visit the farms  
**[0:14:50-0:14:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:14:50):**  as much as we want them to right.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:14:52):**  There will be several consumers who would not visit for three four months as well right  
**[0:14:56-0:15:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:14:56):**  but they would all always engage in the community group inside there's a chat group inside our  
**[0:15:02-0:15:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:15:02):**  app so people would be pretty engaged there right and a very common interaction there  
**[0:15:08-0:15:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:15:08):**  would be somebody who has gone to the farm this weekend right they would take a lot of  
**[0:15:12-0:15:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:15:12):**  photos pictures from the farm and post it right and this turned out to be a very good  
**[0:15:18-0:15:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:15:18):**  trust building mechanism because consumers would basically they are now trusting somebody  
**[0:15:26-0:15:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:15:26):**  else who's visited that so it's almost like your organic inspection or inspection of an  
**[0:15:31-0:15:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:15:31):**  organic farm is being done by crowdsourced audit you know rather than you trying to go  
**[0:15:37-0:15:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:15:37):**  ahead and take a showing a certificate saying hey this guy came in and and he inspected  
**[0:15:42-0:15:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:15:42):**  and this seems to be a lot more powerful in people's minds that somebody or the other  
**[0:15:47-0:15:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:15:47):**  is all continuously going there I have a way to find out information from them even if  
**[0:15:51-0:15:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:15:51):**  I cannot visit myself right.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:15:53):**  So it's like a continuous crowdsource audit so that mechanism is something which has played  
**[0:15:58-0:16:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:15:58):**  out very well in terms of so people find us a very good trusted source and which is why  
**[0:16:06-0:16:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:16:06):**  a lot of our consumer subscribers are people who for example some of them have lifestyle  
**[0:16:13-0:16:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:16:13):**  diseases like cancer etc and for them it's extremely critical to go and find sources  
**[0:16:20-0:16:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:16:20):**  of food that they can absolutely trust right because they have been medically advised to  
**[0:16:25-0:16:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:16:25):**  have food without grown without any chemicals.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:16:28):**  So anyway so what we basically saw was that we have built a solution which a lot of people  
**[0:16:34-0:16:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:16:34):**  are using but it is originally it was actually built for 10-15 percent of those people if  
**[0:16:42-0:16:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:16:42):**  people who would come to the farm at times and things like that others are using it just  
**[0:16:46-0:16:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:16:46):**  because they do not have a suitable alternative which gives them safe healthy food which they  
**[0:16:53-0:16:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:16:53):**  can trust and trace right that does not exist for them.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:16:58):**  So basically what we said was okay so there are two choices one choice is that we could  
**[0:17:03-0:17:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:17:03):**  continue to expand into multiple cities in this particular more go deeper or based on  
**[0:17:09-0:17:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:17:09):**  whatever you would learn we have learned can we go ahead and introduce a model right which  
**[0:17:14-0:17:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:17:14):**  uses all of these building blocks that we have right but rearranged in a slightly different  
**[0:17:19-0:17:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:17:19):**  way right and that could be the offering for people who are not interested in a farming  
**[0:17:24-0:17:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:17:24):**  experience but are basically interested in getting good food right.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:17:29):**  So the way we do it is very simple so we have this business the original farmers and many  
**[0:17:38-0:17:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:17:38):**  farm model that's running and we will probably launch right now we are just in two cities  
**[0:17:41-0:17:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:17:41):**  we are probably going to launch in a few more cities gradually as well but one of the areas  
**[0:17:47-0:17:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:17:47):**  that we are focusing on is how do you build a service for those remaining 80 percent of  
**[0:17:51-0:17:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:17:51):**  people who are using the service but for whom this was not really built for it right and  
**[0:17:56-0:18:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:17:56):**  there are more convenient and more efficient mechanisms possible.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:18:00):**  So what we are doing there is as follows so we have basically and we launched this somewhere  
**[0:18:06-0:18:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:18:06):**  in November end so it's been about three months since we launched this but basically what  
**[0:18:10-0:18:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:18:10):**  we said was that if you have to fix the food system building community and engagement is  
**[0:18:17-0:18:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:18:17):**  something which is absolutely necessary right I mean we cannot fix things in a silo by being  
**[0:18:24-0:18:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:18:24):**  on our own right so community is a very important angle of it.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:18:29):**  Secondly is that traceability must be there you need to know where your food is coming  
**[0:18:35-0:18:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:18:35):**  from right that's going to be important and third was from a trust perspective trust we  
**[0:18:42-0:18:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:18:42):**  need to enable people to build that trust and we cannot we should not probably go out  
**[0:18:47-0:18:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:18:47):**  on our own and say trust us you know there should be mechanisms and models in place so  
**[0:18:54-0:19:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:18:54):**  that this trust happens on its own so we kept these three things kind of in mind and what  
**[0:19:00-0:19:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:19:00):**  we have launched essentially is we call it so the way I mean this model actually has  
**[0:19:09-0:19:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:19:09):**  been very popular in China since I think late 2018 but in a slightly different context but  
**[0:19:16-0:19:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:19:16):**  essentially what we do is we form groups of people in localities or in neighborhoods right  
**[0:19:22-0:19:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:19:22):**  so in various neighborhoods in Bangalore we have about I think close to 200 such groups  
**[0:19:28-0:19:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:19:28):**  now right these groups are people with some of the larger groups are people with 70 80  
**[0:19:34-0:19:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:19:34):**  people who all live in either the same apartment complex or absolutely in the same block completely  
**[0:19:39-0:19:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:19:39):**  right so these groups of people they basically we connect them to specific sets of farmers  
**[0:19:48-0:19:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:19:48):**  right which could depend on the part of Bangalore that they are based in right so now those  
**[0:19:54-0:20:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:19:54):**  farmers we still if you remember our conversation we have on the technology side we have two  
**[0:20:00-0:20:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:20:00):**  things right the consumers have an app and the farmers have an app as well right and  
**[0:20:05-0:20:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:20:05):**  the farmers use that app to do farm management etc so what we have done is some of our existing  
**[0:20:11-0:20:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:20:11):**  many farmers as well as we have tied up with several other farmers right and we have given  
**[0:20:16-0:20:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:20:16):**  them a app which basically gives them a production plan and they focus on growing four or five  
**[0:20:21-0:20:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:20:21):**  different vegetables okay so they do not do they do not do 40 or 50 vegetables like our  
**[0:20:29-0:20:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:20:29):**  mini farm setup do but they focus on four or five vegetables but they do it in a slightly  
**[0:20:34-0:20:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:20:34):**  different approach as to compared to traditional farming right so in traditional farming let's  
**[0:20:40-0:20:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:20:40):**  say you have two acres of land maybe you're going to plant spinach in it you'll do mono  
**[0:20:46-0:20:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:20:46):**  cropping and then you plant all of them at one go so that your labor is minimized and  
**[0:20:52-0:20:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:20:52):**  then after four weeks you are going to harvest let's say 20,000 bunches of spinach and you  
**[0:20:57-0:21:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:20:57):**  will try to use you will go to a in in India you would basically go to a mandi it's called  
**[0:21:04-0:21:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:21:04):**  those are the agricultural markets right which are basically b2b where an auction of your  
**[0:21:09-0:21:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:21:09):**  produce happens and then five or six intermediaries finally take that produce to the end consumer  
**[0:21:15-0:21:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:21:15):**  right this of course means that the farmer gets only 15 percent or maximum 20 percent  
**[0:21:20-0:21:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:21:20):**  of what the end consumer pays number one a lot of wastage because it changes so many  
**[0:21:26-0:21:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:21:26):**  hands and farmers never get the upside so prices keep on changing prices are very fluctuating  
**[0:21:30-0:21:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:21:30):**  very sometimes you lose money sometimes you make money but upside is typically kept by  
**[0:21:36-0:21:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:21:36):**  the intermediaries the farmers don't enjoy much of their upside right so anyway so that  
**[0:21:42-0:21:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:21:42):**  is the traditional farming model right what we believe is a lot more sustainable a lot  
**[0:21:47-0:21:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:21:47):**  more uh friendlier to the soil is of course when you are doing multi-cropping right but  
**[0:21:52-0:21:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:21:52):**  if you are doing multi-cropping the way we kind of ask all of these folks to do it differently  
**[0:21:59-0:22:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:21:59):**  we tell them you need to harvest things every week at least a couple of two or three times  
**[0:22:05-0:22:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:22:05):**  every week right and you need to sow also every week right so it's not like the earlier  
**[0:22:11-0:22:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:22:11):**  thing the traditional farming model is so once wait for x number of weeks or x number  
**[0:22:17-0:22:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:22:17):**  of months harvest everything at one go take it to the market right here it's no no i have  
**[0:22:22-0:22:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:22:22):**  two acres i'm going to divide it up into five plots one plot i'm going to plant this week  
**[0:22:28-0:22:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:22:28):**  next week i'm going to plant another plot right and you are always growing four or five  
**[0:22:32-0:22:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:22:32):**  different vegetables so not only does it diversify your risk as a small grower but uh you are  
**[0:22:39-0:22:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:22:39):**  never really uh of course you will be doing uh multi-cropping right and you are doing  
**[0:22:46-0:22:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:22:46):**  constant harvest as well right again this constant harvest is almost like a it's actually  
**[0:22:52-0:23:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:22:52):**  like a uh like a systematic investment plan right so if you are not if you are let's say  
**[0:23:01-0:23:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:23:01):**  investing in the equity market right uh one of the uh best ways to do it is by doing a  
**[0:23:08-0:23:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:23:08):**  systematic investment plan right saying hey you know what every month five percent of  
**[0:23:13-0:23:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:23:13):**  my or ten percent of my salary i'm just going to put in this particular index fund irrespective  
**[0:23:18-0:23:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:23:18):**  of whether the market is going up or going down right in the long run uh that sort of  
**[0:23:23-0:23:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:23:23):**  a strategy has always been nice and safe and has given good returns right uh rather than  
**[0:23:28-0:23:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:23:28):**  waiting to time the market yeah which is impossible with food as well it's very similar what you  
**[0:23:34-0:23:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:23:34):**  mentioned with vegetables it's the same you you can never you can never time the market  
**[0:23:38-0:23:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:23:38):**  or outsmart the market maybe you do it once but a few times in a row is very difficult  
**[0:23:43-0:23:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:23:43):**  right right and i mean we have just talked to hundreds of farmers who tell us you know  
**[0:23:49-0:23:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:23:49):**  uh last season i grew capsicum i made so much money this season i uh decided to grow cucumber  
**[0:23:54-0:24:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:23:54):**  and i lost it all you know so and it's so surprising but uh i have uh met so many farmers  
**[0:24:01-0:24:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:24:01):**  who have given up farming and i would ask them why are you given up farming no sir last  
**[0:24:05-0:24:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:24:05):**  season i made a lot of money that's why i gave up farming why would you give up farming  
**[0:24:09-0:24:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:24:09):**  if you made a lot of money out of it so it's almost so then they're like oh maybe if i  
**[0:24:13-0:24:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:24:13):**  continue maybe i'll lose money so it's almost like going to a casino you know that uh okay  
**[0:24:18-0:24:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:24:18):**  i am hundred dollars ahead so let me uh move out now while i'm in the positive right so  
**[0:24:23-0:24:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:24:23):**  uh which means that interesting risk mitigation strategies can be used and one of the ways  
**[0:24:29-0:24:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:24:29):**  to do it is kind of like this sort of an approach which is what let's say market gardens would  
**[0:24:33-0:24:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:24:33):**  typically do right in various uh parts of the world unfortunately india does not have  
**[0:24:38-0:24:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:24:38):**  many market gardens where you know this sort of an approach where they're constantly uh  
**[0:24:44-0:24:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:24:44):**  growing stuff constantly taking so uh so anyway so what we do is uh uh so we have given farmers  
**[0:24:51-0:24:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:24:51):**  these apps where we tell them there's a guaranteed optic as long as you follow our production  
**[0:24:56-0:25:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:24:56):**  plan right uh and you follow the instructions on that we'll make sure that we procure the  
**[0:25:02-0:25:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:25:02):**  produce from you right consumers know where they are getting all of this from and there's  
**[0:25:08-0:25:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:25:08):**  a very efficient last mile distribution uh system at play here and this was required  
**[0:25:13-0:25:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:25:13):**  because uh if you look at fresh produce um last mile costs are usually four to five times  
**[0:25:21-0:25:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:25:21):**  the cost of first mile and when i say first mile it's basically farm to city right and  
**[0:25:27-0:25:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:25:27):**  last mile is from the city to individual consumer homes so that last mile is usually at least  
**[0:25:32-0:25:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:25:32):**  in india it's almost four times the first mile cost okay and uh so which is why uh it  
**[0:25:41-0:25:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:25:41):**  made sense to create a distribution model where that last mile cost is really minimized  
**[0:25:46-0:25:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:25:46):**  right and indian cities lots of traffic and all of this stuff so that's where all of these  
**[0:25:50-0:25:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:25:50):**  local neighborhood hubs kind of play a role we call this farm is in tribes so that's basically  
**[0:25:57-0:26:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:25:57):**  our new product uh farm is in tribes which we think will appeal to those 80 people right  
**[0:26:03-0:26:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:26:03):**  uh and pretty much it should appeal to actually pretty much everybody right because what we  
**[0:26:08-0:26:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:26:08):**  are trying to get there is to get uh good quality organically grown food at uh much  
**[0:26:16-0:26:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:26:16):**  cheaper prices than what you get in organic stores right and we really really believe  
**[0:26:20-0:26:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:26:20):**  that uh although uh uh organically grown stuff is currently a very small part of the overall  
**[0:26:28-0:26:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:26:28):**  market in india but it can really explode almost overnight if we can just get the prices  
**[0:26:35-0:26:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:26:35):**  of organic food down to within 20 percent of what regular conventional produced is priced  
**[0:26:41-0:26:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:26:41):**  at right now it's almost at 100 percent higher right so if we can get it down to 20 percent  
**[0:26:47-0:26:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:26:47):**  higher so now the question is how are you going to get it down to 20 percent higher  
**[0:26:52-0:26:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:26:52):**  because in the short run your costs of production are going to be higher uh in organic farming  
**[0:26:57-0:27:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:26:57):**  in terms of you know labor uh it does require a lot more labor till your soil becomes completely  
**[0:27:03-0:27:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:27:03):**  self-sufficient uh uh our experience has been that the cost of production in organic farming  
**[0:27:09-0:27:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:27:09):**  can actually be uh higher right and lower you mean the cost at some point yes yeah after  
**[0:27:16-0:27:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:27:16):**  so once your soil has become has got really good organic carbon percentage after that  
**[0:27:20-0:27:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:27:20):**  point of time what happens is that you realize oh i don't need to put in much stuff all of  
**[0:27:25-0:27:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:27:25):**  my composting is happening at the farm right and i'm not spending a lot of money buying  
**[0:27:30-0:27:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:27:30):**  fertilizers and pesticides so your input cost drops and things are really good and i'm still  
**[0:27:35-0:27:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:27:35):**  getting good yield in those initial years the yield is usually lower uh and things go  
**[0:27:41-0:27:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:27:41):**  slower but once you've got your soil organic carbon to more than uh let's say three four  
**[0:27:45-0:27:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:27:45):**  percent then things become really good and how many years does it take normally uh so  
**[0:27:51-0:27:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:27:51):**  it would take about three to four years it would take to kind of get to that sort of  
**[0:27:54-0:28:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:27:54):**  a stage it really depends a lot on how much you are willing to invest into it right because  
**[0:28:00-0:28:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:28:00):**  uh if you are putting in for example in every acre if you are putting in 40 tons of compost  
**[0:28:05-0:28:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:28:05):**  every year then you can probably turn things around very quickly even in one and a half  
**[0:28:09-0:28:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:28:09):**  years or so basically the only metric that seems to matter more than everything else  
**[0:28:16-0:28:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:28:16):**  is the soil organic matter percentage or soil organic carbon percentage you know if you  
**[0:28:22-0:28:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:28:22):**  can just get that to be really high because then all of the best problems etc start really  
**[0:28:26-0:28:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:28:26):**  going away yeah it's a great proxy yeah so how do we get organic food to people at just  
**[0:28:34-0:28:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:28:34):**  20 percent premium on inorganic food by doing two things right one is by doing disintermediation  
**[0:28:40-0:28:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:28:40):**  right so that there are not those five or six intermediaries in so by doing direct procurement  
**[0:28:45-0:28:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:28:45):**  with farmers number one number two is by training farmers giving them some of the software tools  
**[0:28:52-0:28:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:28:52):**  uh know-how required which we have learned over the last two three years on how to basically  
**[0:28:57-0:29:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:28:57):**  improve their organic yields right so that so that's the second thing and third is by  
**[0:29:02-0:29:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:29:02):**  having a very efficient distribution system especially in the last mile so the way the  
**[0:29:07-0:29:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:29:07):**  last mile system works is it's actually very very straightforward and simple so every community  
**[0:29:12-0:29:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:29:12):**  or neighborhood group has a leader okay and so every farm is and tribe has a tribe leader  
**[0:29:17-0:29:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:29:17):**  uh there's a economic arrangement with the tribe leader as well so everything that's  
**[0:29:23-0:29:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:29:23):**  sold uh through tribes parmesan makes 30 percent the tribe leader makes 10 percent and 60 percent  
**[0:29:29-0:29:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:29:29):**  is made by the farmer okay wow that's how the model works so the farmer ends up making  
**[0:29:35-0:29:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:29:35):**  almost three times what he makes when he sells in the market right and so it's 60 30 10 and  
**[0:29:43-0:29:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:29:43):**  uh the tribe leaders are responsible for creating the groups right uh going ahead and telling  
**[0:29:51-0:29:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:29:51):**  more recruiting new members so our customer acquisition costs are low right uh the delivery  
**[0:29:58-0:30:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:29:58):**  costs are very minimal because we don't we go ahead and deliver everything to the tribe  
**[0:30:03-0:30:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:30:03):**  leaders home right and people either come and pick up or the tribe leader so these are  
**[0:30:07-0:30:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:30:07):**  a lot of them are in apartment complexes so if it's not a very large apartment complex  
**[0:30:12-0:30:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:30:12):**  you know you get these 20 bags and you could just say okay uh folks please come between  
**[0:30:17-0:30:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:30:17):**  6 pm to 6 30 pm uh on wednesdays and collect the bags from me right we have started these  
**[0:30:24-0:30:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:30:24):**  tribes at home right now we are going to experiment starting some of these tribes even at offices  
**[0:30:28-0:30:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:30:28):**  as well right uh and i have a feeling that offices might really work out uh uh well uh  
**[0:30:37-0:30:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:30:37):**  so that's that's basically the model um that we are currently kind of focusing on uh because  
**[0:30:43-0:30:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:30:43):**  i think the mini farm model is something which is it is really really optimized for people  
**[0:30:50-0:30:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:30:50):**  who want to learn farming who want to get completely involved but it's not the most  
**[0:30:54-0:31:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:30:54):**  efficient from a production uh uh or pricing standpoint no completely it makes a lot of  
**[0:31:00-0:31:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:31:00):**  sense and it seems a lot of learning and i think a lot of farmers and other people working  
**[0:31:06-0:31:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:31:06):**  in the let's say the distribution and the logistics and how to create this short food  
**[0:31:12-0:31:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:31:12):**  webs are running into the same issues are running into okay what is efficient how do  
**[0:31:16-0:31:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:31:16):**  i get it to the last mile which is very very expensive obviously delivering at home for  
**[0:31:21-0:31:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:31:21):**  80 people would be completely impossible etc etc etc so you see very similar discussions  
**[0:31:27-0:31:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:31:27):**  happening around the world on these topics and in terms of um the you mentioned a number  
**[0:31:32-0:31:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:31:32):**  of times the organic farming world and last time we discussed quite a bit the regenerative  
**[0:31:36-0:31:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:31:36):**  sites or the zero budget natural farming how has it been growing has it been growing first  
**[0:31:41-0:31:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:31:41):**  of all and how if yes how has it been growing the focus on a more sustainable more regenerative  
**[0:31:46-0:31:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:31:46):**  ways of farming in india the last two years absolutely so that has actually there's a  
**[0:31:52-0:31:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:31:52):**  lot of good news around that which is that zero budget natural farming has been specifically  
**[0:31:57-0:32:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:31:57):**  mentioned and called out by india's finance minister in the latest budget for example  
**[0:32:03-0:32:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:32:03):**  right so there have been allocations towards that it has been discussed in parliament right  
**[0:32:08-0:32:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:32:08):**  so there is a lot of uh focus around that and i think what people are also realizing  
**[0:32:17-0:32:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:32:17):**  in the country as well as uh uh politicians policymakers etc is that there are some very  
**[0:32:24-0:32:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:32:24):**  very good learnings from our traditional ways of farming right our traditional way of farming  
**[0:32:29-0:32:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:32:29):**  uh uh let's say before before we all invented discovered uh the haberboost process of uh  
**[0:32:38-0:32:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:32:38):**  nitrogen fixation right even before that india was a fairly densely populated country right  
**[0:32:43-0:32:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:32:43):**  we had a lot of mouths to feed right and we were able to do that uh pretty easily right  
**[0:32:49-0:32:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:32:49):**  uh by using traditional farming making sure there are traditional ways of putting that  
**[0:32:54-0:33:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:32:54):**  nitrogen and carbon into the soil so uh so i think there is a lot more things have changed  
**[0:33:00-0:33:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:33:00):**  uh quite rapidly in the last two three years since we started because now a lot of people  
**[0:33:06-0:33:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:33:06):**  know about zero budget natural farming for example as well as other flavors of regenerative  
**[0:33:12-0:33:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:33:12):**  agriculture so i think the the move is pretty good uh in terms of organic farming so to  
**[0:33:22-0:33:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:33:22):**  speak right there is one issue that we see which is that a lot of consumers have also  
**[0:33:30-0:33:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:33:30):**  developed uh you know uh some sort of a negative thing around organic farming as well because  
**[0:33:40-0:33:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:33:40):**  a lot of consumers have started thinking organic is basically just about marketing you know  
**[0:33:45-0:33:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:33:45):**  and nothing is really organic and it's all just higher price and there's a lot of marketing  
**[0:33:51-0:33:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:33:51):**  around it so in certain uh segments organic is also becoming a bad word so to speak right  
**[0:33:58-0:34:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:33:58):**  so i think uh there is definitely a lot of consumer education uh which needs to happen  
**[0:34:03-0:34:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:34:03):**  but uh things are far better than than just two three years back at least in terms of  
**[0:34:09-0:34:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:34:09):**  policy support etc having said that there is still uh see the one of the things i think  
**[0:34:15-0:34:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:34:15):**  which will be a issue going forward i'm not sure how it is outside india but at least  
**[0:34:20-0:34:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:34:20):**  in india is that the the entrenched conventional farming lobby is going to react to this right  
**[0:34:30-0:34:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:34:30):**  so we do see nowadays articles being written in newspapers uh uh uh questioning for example  
**[0:34:37-0:34:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:34:37):**  hey is this zero budget natural farming thing does it really work is it actually scientific  
**[0:34:42-0:34:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:34:42):**  right or is it more of you know uh too empirical cannot be and i think those are actually good  
**[0:34:48-0:34:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:34:48):**  questions to ask because it will force uh some of us to produce the data that can be  
**[0:34:53-0:35:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:34:53):**  convincing right so that is uh uh uh in some sense good that there is but i think uh we  
**[0:35:00-0:35:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:35:00):**  are entering that era where uh there will be a lot of questioning of organic as well  
**[0:35:06-0:35:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:35:06):**  as regenerative saying that hey you know the typical arguments which are there right in  
**[0:35:12-0:35:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:35:12):**  terms of is this going to be enough to uh feed so many mouths right yeah so i think  
**[0:35:17-0:35:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:35:17):**  a lot of that is going to come in but it shows that you're getting to a space that that at  
**[0:35:22-0:35:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:35:22):**  least they feel a sort of threat i mean i think we can learn a lot from the renewable  
**[0:35:26-0:35:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:35:26):**  energy people and the let's say the doubt campaigns that the fossil fuel companies have  
**[0:35:33-0:35:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:35:33):**  created over the last decades but it's an interesting sign that you're getting to that  
**[0:35:36-0:35:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:35:36):**  space means that you're becoming a threat to them for sure they will use every trick  
**[0:35:41-0:35:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:35:41):**  in the book to delay so i actually kind of take it as a positive sign yeah i take it  
**[0:35:46-0:35:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:35:46):**  as a positive sign that since you have started seeing a few of those articles in newspapers  
**[0:35:51-0:35:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:35:51):**  etc now that means that you are uh earlier the whole thing was too small for uh folks  
**[0:35:57-0:36:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:35:57):**  to react now it's like okay hang on this is becoming bigger so it's a threat to a traditional  
**[0:36:04-0:36:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:36:04):**  way of things so i think i think it's good and in terms of and that would be my final  
**[0:36:08-0:36:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:36:08):**  question of this short check-in that which is becoming a bit longer but it's very interesting  
**[0:36:12-0:36:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:36:12):**  because there's so much has happened in the last years what has happened on the we've  
**[0:36:15-0:36:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:36:15):**  discussed the investor side of things also last time have you seen more interest is it  
**[0:36:21-0:36:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:36:21):**  been easier to to let's say present pharma to the tech investors you normally speak to  
**[0:36:27-0:36:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:36:27):**  in bungalow what has been the investor mindset towards these kind of enterprises where as  
**[0:36:34-0:36:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:36:34):**  we discussed last time times are always longer obviously there's nature involved it's very  
**[0:36:38-0:36:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:36:38):**  different than your normal app photo sharing sure so we are we are actually uh we are just  
**[0:36:45-0:36:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:36:45):**  getting ready for the next round right so we never raised any money after that because  
**[0:36:50-0:36:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:36:50):**  uh i mean this was a business where cash flow started coming in as well right uh but we  
**[0:36:57-0:37:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:36:57):**  are going to raise around now so we have just started reaching out to investors etc uh the  
**[0:37:04-0:37:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:37:04):**  first thing that i notice uh in general is that overall people feel uh like uh that people  
**[0:37:11-0:37:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:37:11):**  feel that organic in general is a small market right so that's one hesitation that we see  
**[0:37:16-0:37:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:37:16):**  from uh conventional traditional investors i mean uh we have not talked to a lot of investors  
**[0:37:23-0:37:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:37:23):**  right now uh but whoever we have spoken to seem to indicate that hey yeah all of that  
**[0:37:29-0:37:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:37:29):**  side all of that is fine why don't you guys you know do fresh produce but don't don't  
**[0:37:35-0:37:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:37:35):**  restrict yourself to organic right do all of the conventional stuff so i think uh some  
**[0:37:41-0:37:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:37:41):**  of that is there still some nice reports come out which say oh hey you know what organic  
**[0:37:46-0:37:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:37:46):**  has now increased so much right so at least that's what we see in india or the uh investors  
**[0:37:51-0:37:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:37:51):**  that we have met is that um like people have concerns around whether it's too small a market  
**[0:37:57-0:38:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:37:57):**  yeah and how do you think i mean that's going to be interesting to see it's going to be  
**[0:38:01-0:38:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:38:01):**  interesting to see how they respond to your numbers and to this strong strong interest  
**[0:38:05-0:38:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:38:05):**  you have received from customers yes so as i said i think uh so india is a very price  
**[0:38:10-0:38:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:38:10):**  sensitive market in general right so i very strongly feel that there are one or two things  
**[0:38:16-0:38:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:38:16):**  that need to get fixed and those two things that need to get fixed is one is uh the price  
**[0:38:23-0:38:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:38:23):**  part needs to get fixed right it needs to be more affordable and it is possible to make  
**[0:38:28-0:38:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:38:28):**  it more affordable for uh for consumers right and i seriously believe that if it can be  
**[0:38:35-0:38:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:38:35):**  made more profitable in one year you can see uh the market being 10x of what it is right  
**[0:38:42-0:38:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:38:42):**  because nobody i mean if you talk to because you've talked to thousands of consumers right  
**[0:38:47-0:38:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:38:47):**  everybody is if you talk to them they would be in that mode you know uh if it was it's  
**[0:38:53-0:38:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:38:53):**  hundred it's almost double the price or triple the price i wish it was just you know 20 30  
**[0:38:59-0:39:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:38:59):**  percent more then i don't mind paying right that's a conversation we have had so many  
**[0:39:04-0:39:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:39:04):**  different times so i think if there's a way to make organic more affordable which is what  
**[0:39:08-0:39:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:39:08):**  we are trying to do and then the second big problem of course is the the trust part of  
**[0:39:13-0:39:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:39:13):**  it right which was part of our original thesis when we had started right how do we solve  
**[0:39:17-0:39:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:39:17):**  the trust issue with organic enough trust deficit less regulation uh or regulations  
**[0:39:24-0:39:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:39:24):**  with a lot of holes sort of a country like india and i think uh this sort of an approach  
**[0:39:31-0:39:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:39:31):**  where you don't necessarily rely only on certifications or certificates to prove trustworthiness but  
**[0:39:39-0:39:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:39:39):**  uh kind of get people involved is going to be crucial and that's for example our tribe  
**[0:39:45-0:39:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:39:45):**  leaders play a very important role in that right because they come on farm visits with  
**[0:39:50-0:39:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:39:50):**  us right so we take them to the farm show them the farms make sure that i mean it's  
**[0:39:55-0:39:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:39:55):**  a it's a criteria to be a tribe leader because this is something which enables and builds  
**[0:39:59-0:40:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:39:59):**  their trust right uh some of our tribe leaders are uh nutritionists for example right so  
**[0:40:06-0:40:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:40:06):**  these are people who automatically consumers trust as well that okay she's a nutritionist  
**[0:40:12-0:40:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:40:12):**  she probably knows uh what's good and what's not so good what is acceptable what is not  
**[0:40:18-0:40:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:40:18):**  acceptable and things like that right so i think uh if we can solve for trust and uh  
**[0:40:25-0:40:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:40:25):**  uh price then i think the organic market can completely explode in india so this is on  
**[0:40:32-0:40:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:40:32):**  the fresh produce side the the funny part and this is my sense of it right is that uh  
**[0:40:39-0:40:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:40:39):**  organic cosmetics to me seems to be a much larger market than i think so too i have the  
**[0:40:44-0:40:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:40:44):**  discussion all the time it's we pay much easier and much more for what we put on our skin and  
**[0:40:49-0:40:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:40:49):**  what we put in our mouth yeah and it's not like so this price sensitiveness that we see  
**[0:40:55-0:40:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:40:55):**  when it comes to vegetables and fruits does not exist when it comes to cosmetics there  
**[0:40:59-0:41:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:40:59):**  right in fact it's probably the other way around oh this thing costs so much it must  
**[0:41:03-0:41:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:41:03):**  be really really good you know so so uh i mean that's something that we hear from investors  
**[0:41:10-0:41:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:41:10):**  uh as well that organic cosmetics is actually they feel more comfortable investing in that  
**[0:41:16-0:41:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:41:16):**  versus wow uh something which is related to food in general that's really interesting and  
**[0:41:23-0:41:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:41:23):**  just the last question on the tribes so with that price point you're getting to the 20 or  
**[0:41:29-0:41:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:41:29):**  you're getting close what is your feeling what's your since you launched in november  
**[0:41:33-0:41:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:41:33):**  where do you see yourself where are you now and more or less in terms of fixing the price  
**[0:41:38-0:41:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:41:38):**  issue or challenge yes yeah so i think uh it's looking very promising because we are already  
**[0:41:45-0:41:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:41:45):**  lower than most organic stores retail physical stores etc we are able to do it lower than them  
**[0:41:51-0:41:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:41:51):**  because of those two strategies in place right directly working with farmers uh uh procuring  
**[0:41:57-0:42:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:41:57):**  and this last mile efficient last mile distribution the only thing we have to now crack is on the  
**[0:42:03-0:42:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/07/shameek-chakravarty-2/#t=0:42:03):**  scale side of it because right now the trucks that are coming from the farms to the city are

## 163 Jim Mann - Biochar and enhanced rock weathering to remove 1B ton carbon annually and holistically  
**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  
**[0:00:05-0:00:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:00:05):**  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com or in the links below.  
**[0:00:12-0:00:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:00:13):**  We need to decarbonize our society ASAP and still remove about 10 gigatons a year to keep  
**[0:00:19-0:00:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:00:19):**  most of our planet livable.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:00:21):**  How do we do that at scale and at speed?  
**[0:00:23-0:00:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:00:23):**  Of course, soil and trees are key, but only as permanent as the farm management.  
**[0:00:28-0:00:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:00:28):**  So we also need to look at things like biochar and enhanced rock weathering, which could  
**[0:00:32-0:00:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:00:32):**  by the way also replace much of the farm chemical inputs, like chemical fertilizer and other  
**[0:00:37-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:00:37):**  things.  
**[0:00:38-0:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:00:38):**  So much more research is needed about the application and the impact, and luckily our  
**[0:00:42-0:00:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:00:42):**  guest of today is doing exactly that.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:00:45):**  Research but not in academia, but at a huge scale financed by carbon credits sold to companies  
**[0:00:50-0:00:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:00:50):**  like Stripe.  
**[0:00:51-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:00:51):**  I love checking interviews and this is no different.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:00:54):**  It's so great to have Jim Mann of the Future Forest Company back on the show.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:00:59):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture, Investing as if the  
**[0:01:04-0:01:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:01:04):**  Planet Mattered, a podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and  
**[0:01:08-0:01:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:01:08):**  agriculture space to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil,  
**[0:01:13-0:01:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:01:13):**  people, local communities and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:19-0:01:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:01:19):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:21-0:01:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:01:21):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:25-0:01:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:01:25):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:01:28):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:33-0:01:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:01:33):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:01:37):**  In March last year, we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support  
**[0:01:41-0:01:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:01:41):**  our work.  
**[0:01:42-0:01:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:01:42):**  And so many of you have joined as a member.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:01:44):**  We've launched different types of benefits, exclusive content, Q&A webinars with former  
**[0:01:48-0:01:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:01:48):**  guests, Ask Me Anything sessions, plus so much more to come in the future.

**[0:02:01-0:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:02:01):**  Thank you.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:02:03):**  Welcome to another interview today, a check in interview with Jim Mann, the founder and  
**[0:02:07-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:02:07):**  CEO of the Future Forest Company.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:02:09):**  And just as a disclosure, we're a very small investor in this company.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:02:13):**  I'm so happy to have Jim back.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:02:15):**  It seems like a long time ago, and actually, it's only June last year, so 2021.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:02:19):**  But so much has happened in the space and so much has happened with the company.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:02:22):**  So I'm very much looking forward to unpacking so many things we discussed last time, the  
**[0:02:26-0:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:02:26):**  biochar to enhance weathering, how to 10x the carbon potential, or maybe even more of  
**[0:02:31-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:02:31):**  reforestation, regeneration in general, COP, everything that has happened in this crazy,  
**[0:02:37-0:02:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:02:37):**  crazy year.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:02:38):**  So welcome back, Jim.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:02:39):**  It's great to be back.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:02:40):**  Thanks for having me.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:02:41):**  Because you're in crazy growth mode, basically.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:02:43):**  But for the people that didn't listen to the interview, and of course, I will link it below,  
**[0:02:46-0:02:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:02:46):**  if you had to present now, what is the Future Forest Company and how would you present it  
**[0:02:51-0:02:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:02:51):**  in a couple of sentences?  
**[0:02:53-0:02:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:02:53):**  So we're a carbon removal company, we started off with looking at reforestation.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:02:59):**  And we've moved more and more towards sort of what I talk about is holistic carbon removal  
**[0:03:05-0:03:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:03:05):**  solutions to taking natural processes and accelerating them.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:03:10):**  So the biochar and enhanced rock weathering.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:03:12):**  And we previously when we've spoken, we've talked about the three being co deployed and  
**[0:03:17-0:03:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:03:17):**  all being part of a holistic solution.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:03:21):**  We now sort of think about them and are disentangling them a bit.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:03:24):**  So we can deploy them together, or in pairs or individually, depending on how suitable  
**[0:03:33-0:03:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:03:33):**  the location is and feedstocks and things like that.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:03:37):**  Very much, we're trying to scale carbon removal.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:03:40):**  And if you're saying a holistic approach that suggests there is a non holistic approach  
**[0:03:44-0:03:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:03:44):**  to carbon removal, or to natural carbon removal, what would you describe as a non holistic  
**[0:03:49-0:03:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:03:49):**  one?  
**[0:03:50-0:03:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:03:50):**  And what's the big difference between that and a holistic approach?  
**[0:03:52-0:03:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:03:52):**  Yeah, sure.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:03:53):**  So I think of something like DAC, where you have an engineered process.  
**[0:03:57-0:03:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:03:57):**  What is a DAC for anybody?  
**[0:03:58-0:03:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:03:58):**  Direct Air Cap Shocking?  
**[0:03:59-0:04:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:03:59):**  So where you have these big fans that are taking CO2 straight out of the air, and then  
**[0:04:05-0:04:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:04:05):**  storing it either as a as mineralization or into deep wells, so into old oil wells, for  
**[0:04:11-0:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:04:11):**  example,  
**[0:04:12-0:04:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:04:12):**  which got a lot of attention last year, and this year as well, like a lot of money have  
**[0:04:15-0:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:04:15):**  been raised a lot of fuzz and excitement around it.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:04:18):**  But I think issues I mean, why is it a non holistic approach?  
**[0:04:21-0:04:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:04:21):**  Is it the cost?  
**[0:04:22-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:04:22):**  Is it where to go?  
**[0:04:23-0:04:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:04:23):**  No, I mean, it just doesn't have any additional benefit, you know, the so it removes carbon,  
**[0:04:29-0:04:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:04:29):**  it does what it says on the tin, the storage looks good and permanent.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:04:33):**  And particularly when it's mineralized, but deep wells also shouldn't leak.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:04:38):**  But there's no there's no benefit beyond the process.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:04:41):**  So when we look at biochar, there's a soil amendment, particularly in dry land agriculture,  
**[0:04:47-0:04:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:04:47):**  for example, as a water retainer and a nutrient retainer, it can buffer runoff of chemicals  
**[0:04:54-0:04:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:04:54):**  from land.  
**[0:04:55-0:05:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:04:55):**  If you look at enhanced rock weathering, the you've got two things going on, you're releasing  
**[0:05:01-0:05:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:05:01):**  bicarbonations, which is the store of the carbon from the atmosphere.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:05:06):**  And you're also releasing cations and you and I would think of cations as fertilizer.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:05:10):**  So you've got a two way relationship, you're you're not just removing co2, but you're doing  
**[0:05:16-0:05:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:05:16):**  something beneficial with the output.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:05:18):**  So so we sort of look at the engineer solutions as this is route one, this is real, you know,  
**[0:05:22-0:05:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:05:22):**  straight line, grab the co2 lock it up.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:05:26):**  Very linear.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:05:27):**  Yeah, very linear.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:05:28):**  And then if you look at the other end, you've got the nature based solutions, where we're  
**[0:05:31-0:05:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:05:31):**  trying to reestablish ecosystems.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:05:33):**  And and we have some concerns with that.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:05:37):**  And we talked about this last time, I think about the forestry and concerns certainly  
**[0:05:40-0:05:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:05:40):**  I have around forestry and planting the wrong tree in the wrong place or in places where  
**[0:05:46-0:05:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:05:46):**  at two degrees of warming, the trees won't be stable or won't be removing co2.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:05:53):**  And then we're sort of in this in between space where we're taking natural processes,  
**[0:05:57-0:06:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:05:57):**  you know, biochar is just a charcoal production, which you get from forest fires and acts as  
**[0:06:02-0:06:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:06:02):**  a store in soil.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:06:04):**  And rock weathering is the biggest natural sink on the planet anyway, just in nature.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:06:11):**  And we speed that up by by taking rock at smaller particle size and spreading it out  
**[0:06:15-0:06:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:06:15):**  so it can get to get more more access to co2, more access to water and the reaction happens  
**[0:06:21-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:06:21):**  a lot quicker.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:06:23):**  So but you get the additional benefits because that's how soils built soils built from rock  
**[0:06:27-0:06:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:06:27):**  weathering that's your minerals in the soil come from that process anyway, if we take  
**[0:06:31-0:06:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:06:31):**  the right type of rock and speed it up, not only do we get that soil building process  
**[0:06:36-0:06:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:06:36):**  and the plant nutrition that comes with it, but we also remove co2 at the same time.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:06:40):**  Yeah, and it is permanent or because that's one of the big, let's say doubts people have  
**[0:06:45-0:06:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:06:45):**  about the nature side of things or the natural solution side of things.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:06:49):**  Because when we have these big machines with a lot of vans turning and sucking up air and  
**[0:06:53-0:06:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:06:53):**  taking the co2 out and storing it in an old gas oil well, it seems quite permanent.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:06:58):**  In this case, we need to be able to show that that's permanent as well.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:07:01):**  So how and then we'll talk about what is enhanced rock weathering because I think we have to  
**[0:07:05-0:07:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:07:05):**  describe it visually to people like okay, what does it actually mean?  
**[0:07:08-0:07:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:07:08):**  But this is a very permanent biochar side of things we know it stores a lot and it stores  
**[0:07:13-0:07:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:07:13):**  it I wouldn't say forever, but pretty much forever.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:07:16):**  And on enhanced rock weathering, the co2 is also bind and combiner basically is I think  
**[0:07:21-0:07:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:07:21):**  the last time we said something like 10 or 100,000 years, or at least also forever long  
**[0:07:25-0:07:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:07:25):**  enough to have a significant impact.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:07:27):**  In human terms, enhanced rock weathering is permanent.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:07:30):**  Yeah, the challenge that we face with enhanced rock weathering, and the thing where we've  
**[0:07:34-0:07:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:07:34):**  been investing very heavily is on the science and on the ability to measure it.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:07:39):**  And it when you say it, what?  
**[0:07:40-0:07:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:07:40):**  So the carbon, the carbon removal.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:07:42):**  Yeah, so you want to measure so it's taking rocks, which is a natural process anyway,  
**[0:07:46-0:07:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:07:46):**  that rocks break down in smaller, smaller particles get exposed more to air, bind with  
**[0:07:50-0:07:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:07:50):**  the carbon with the co2 and then release the fertilizer, which is great, because it's how  
**[0:07:54-0:07:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:07:54):**  soil gets built, and also store this carbon.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:07:57):**  And when you say we have to the science part of the it is how much that happens or how  
**[0:08:01-0:08:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:08:01):**  much is being sucked out, because of course, you cannot see it.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:08:04):**  And you can't capture it.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:08:05):**  So the nice thing about something like direct air capture is you can put a meter on it,  
**[0:08:08-0:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:08:08):**  you know, you get a liquefied co2 product that you're going to pump into an oil well,  
**[0:08:12-0:08:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:08:12):**  you can put that through a meter, and you can meet her and say, we know that x liters  
**[0:08:17-0:08:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:08:17):**  or x tons has been then put into this oil well, and it's going to stay there.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:08:21):**  With with something that's working in an ecosystem, you've got a lot more challenges in measuring  
**[0:08:26-0:08:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:08:26):**  it particularly as these are water soluble ions by the very nature.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:08:30):**  So to the process, if we go back to the sort of process you've got and co2 absorbed into  
**[0:08:35-0:08:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:08:35):**  rain, so it's a mixes with rain to create a weak carbonic acid.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:08:39):**  And that has a chemical reaction with the rocks, and then formed by carbonate ions,  
**[0:08:43-0:08:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:08:43):**  which are soluble, some are soluble, some are some are carbonate rock, so you get the  
**[0:08:48-0:08:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:08:48):**  particles in soil and some of it just washes off in solution.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:08:51):**  And so you've got two pathways.  
**[0:08:54-0:08:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:08:54):**  And then you've got all these cations being released that you again, are hard to measure,  
**[0:08:59-0:09:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:08:59):**  because plants are taking them up.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:09:00):**  So actually, the best systems where you want this to happen is where you've got plants  
**[0:09:04-0:09:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:09:04):**  growing, because they're taking up the cations, which improves the rate of the reaction.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:09:08):**  But at the same time, if they're taking up those cations, how do you measure them?  
**[0:09:11-0:09:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:09:11):**  You lose them sort of.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:09:12):**  Yeah.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:09:13):**  So there's real scientific challenges in properly quantifying this.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:09:16):**  You can see that you've put the rock down, you can measure and meter the rock going down.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:09:22):**  But you can't, you've then got a leap of faith to the actual carbon.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:09:28):**  And that's what we've been bridging.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:09:30):**  So we now have a science team and a carbon team who are working together on this.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:09:35):**  And we think we've got solutions for how to quite accurately now monitor the process.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:09:41):**  Yeah, because it's not something you would do in a lab.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:09:44):**  Like it's a living system.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:09:45):**  But I mean, we've been struggling with that in agriculture for a long time to show certain  
**[0:09:49-0:09:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:09:49):**  things that we've seen on land, and sort of don't reproduce because we take a single piece.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:09:52):**  And in this case, it is a full ecosystem that responds to the rain.  
**[0:09:56-0:09:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:09:56):**  So it's very important.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:09:57):**  The water part of this or the rain part doesn't mean it's mostly, I mean, you're working a  
**[0:10:01-0:10:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:10:01):**  lot in the UK, but it doesn't mean it's mostly relevant in, let's say, wetter areas, you  
**[0:10:06-0:10:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:10:06):**  need that bridge between let's say the CO2 in the air and dust clouds and rain to bring  
**[0:10:11-0:10:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:10:11):**  it down.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:10:12):**  Or does it also work with like less humid places?  
**[0:10:15-0:10:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:10:15):**  Yeah, it will.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:10:16):**  And so it depends on your a lot on your soil type.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:10:18):**  So we model out various factors, all of your environmental factors, your rainfall, your  
**[0:10:24-0:10:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:10:24):**  ambient temperatures, etc.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:10:27):**  We also look at the soil type, and these various factors then that still are slightly beyond  
**[0:10:33-0:10:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:10:33):**  scope and things like the bacterial and fungal activity.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:10:38):**  So bacteria, microbes will break this down quicker.  
**[0:10:43-0:10:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:10:43):**  They will also increase the concentration of CO2 in the soil.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:10:47):**  So you have more CO2 in the soil, then you've got a higher concentration of CO2 and the  
**[0:10:52-0:10:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:10:52):**  reaction will happen quicker.  
**[0:10:54-0:10:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:10:54):**  Fungi actively break down rock and work in a symbiotic relationship with certain trees.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:10:59):**  So this is one of the reasons we started off with with forest because you've got those  
**[0:11:03-0:11:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:11:03):**  symbiotic relationships going on.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:11:05):**  So the fungi actually speeding up the weathering process.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:11:08):**  Now that again adds challenges, adds complexity, because how fast are they doing that?  
**[0:11:13-0:11:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:11:13):**  How much is it accelerated?  
**[0:11:14-0:11:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:11:14):**  And as soon as you take this out of the field and put it into a lab, you've got rid of all  
**[0:11:20-0:11:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:11:20):**  those factors.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:11:21):**  And we know they accelerate it.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:11:23):**  We just can't easily quantify how much.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:11:26):**  But we also can't always quantify very well in the field how active they are.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:11:33):**  So you can start from the geochemical data, which you can do in a lab, and then you know  
**[0:11:40-0:11:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:11:40):**  that it's going to speed up from there, but you don't know how much.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:11:42):**  And that's what we're trying to demonstrate is in which environments does this speed up  
**[0:11:48-0:11:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:11:48):**  and how much does it speed up by?  
**[0:11:50-0:11:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:11:50):**  And therefore, how much carbon are we removing over what period of time?  
**[0:11:55-0:12:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:11:55):**  And they're the critical elements that are still kind of unknown to a degree.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:12:01):**  But we're getting closer.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:12:02):**  Yeah, it almost sounds like applied science, like in a company, which is fascinating.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:12:06):**  I think we're in the climate space.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:12:07):**  We're seeing that a lot more because we just don't have the time to wait.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:12:11):**  And it also reminds me of we did an interview with Dr. Elaine Ingham on the soil microbial  
**[0:12:16-0:12:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:12:16):**  activity and the life in the soil.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:12:18):**  And she discovered and many others as well, is that if you take them because we only grew  
**[0:12:22-0:12:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:12:22):**  certain like we only had a certain growth medium in labs.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:12:25):**  So we only saw certain soil biology because they were growing because of that growth medium.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:12:30):**  And we missed like 99.9% of the soil life in the we never saw that in the lab because  
**[0:12:35-0:12:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:12:35):**  we didn't have the full ecosystem there to observe.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:12:38):**  And suddenly this whole sort of world opened up like there are 70,000 species or whatever  
**[0:12:42-0:12:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:12:42):**  the number is.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:12:43):**  And we saw five, something like that, because they did well on that growth medium.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:12:46):**  So it's, yeah, it's very limited, let's say.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:12:49):**  And what I think in this case, it's also like, as you're doing sort of applied scientists,  
**[0:12:52-0:12:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:12:52):**  and it's not all science, it's not all certain yet are your customers because they're buying  
**[0:12:57-0:13:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:12:57):**  the credits, the carbon credits, the removal ones, as long as the customers are fine with  
**[0:13:02-0:13:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:13:02):**  sort of financing the process and not having one certain number that we can just put a  
**[0:13:06-0:13:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:13:06):**  meter on and we're fine.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:13:07):**  As long as that's okay, it's not such a problem that it's not super, super certain yet as  
**[0:13:11-0:13:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:13:11):**  long as the uncertainty is being reduced.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:13:13):**  How are your customers dealing with that?  
**[0:13:15-0:13:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:13:15):**  So we've got the early adopters like stripe who have backed us to not only by buying some  
**[0:13:20-0:13:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:13:20):**  of the carbon from us, but also by putting a grant towards the science so that we can  
**[0:13:26-0:13:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:13:26):**  advance the science.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:13:29):**  And you know, that we've obviously put money alongside that as well.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:13:31):**  But it means that we have postdoc scientists now working as part of our research team to  
**[0:13:37-0:13:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:13:37):**  help us to really dig deep into these issues and try and resolve them.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:13:41):**  And then, you know, you can argue the same about nature based solutions.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:13:44):**  You know, we don't measure exactly how much carbon is stored in in a forest, we tend to  
**[0:13:49-0:13:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:13:49):**  take a handful of trees in that forest, we take a proxy and we go, well, they've grown  
**[0:13:53-0:13:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:13:53):**  pretty well and this looks okay, we've got these these data tables we've produced over  
**[0:13:58-0:14:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:13:58):**  many, many years.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:14:00):**  And so we know that this forest will have stored X million tons of carbon.  
**[0:14:05-0:14:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:14:05):**  And so we can take the same sort of approach that that geochemical data that I'm talking  
**[0:14:08-0:14:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:14:08):**  about, where it's in lab without the microbes, without the fungi, and gives us a baseline.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:14:14):**  So we know that in certain environmental conditions, this is the rate of and with a certain particle  
**[0:14:19-0:14:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:14:19):**  size on some particle size distribution, and there's multiple variables that go into into  
**[0:14:23-0:14:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:14:23):**  how we model this, and it gets quite, quite complicated.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:14:26):**  But as you go through that, you can say we've got good confidence that this, this will weather  
**[0:14:32-0:14:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:14:32):**  over this amount of time.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:14:34):**  And over this amount of time, this is when the CO2 is removed.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:14:37):**  Now what we really need to demonstrate for this to be scalable and adopted across carbon,  
**[0:14:47-0:14:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:14:47):**  the carbon platforms onto things like Vera, is we need to demonstrate that more more robustly  
**[0:14:52-0:14:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:14:52):**  in the field.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:14:53):**  And that's that that's the challenge.  
**[0:14:55-0:15:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:14:55):**  And we need to get to the point where, where forests are, and which we're pretty much at  
**[0:15:01-0:15:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:15:01):**  the point now, I think, where where forests are, and but we'd like to get it further,  
**[0:15:06-0:15:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:15:06):**  we'd like to get it closer to where DAC is, and where we can almost meter it and you can  
**[0:15:11-0:15:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:15:11):**  put down the rock dust at a certain particle size, you know, the mineralogy, you know,  
**[0:15:15-0:15:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:15:15):**  the local conditions, you know, the crops being grown, you can put all of that into  
**[0:15:18-0:15:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:15:18):**  this this, the software package that we're building out in this this model, and it will  
**[0:15:23-0:15:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:15:23):**  give you an accurate weathering curve for that location, then you monitor over time  
**[0:15:28-0:15:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:15:28):**  to inform that this is happening as you'd expect, and that the credits can be released  
**[0:15:32-0:15:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:15:32):**  over this schedule, like with trees, you know, you plant a tree, and and you your credits  
**[0:15:37-0:15:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:15:37):**  will be released over the next 5080 years, depending on where in the world you are.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:15:42):**  It's the same sort of thing within enhanced rock weathering, we put the rock down at a  
**[0:15:46-0:15:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:15:46):**  certain particle size, here's the weathering curve and the credits will be released over  
**[0:15:49-0:15:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:15:49):**  time.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:15:50):**  Yeah.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:15:51):**  And so let's walk through a process because we still didn't talk about how you actually  
**[0:15:54-0:15:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:15:54):**  do this.  
**[0:15:55-0:15:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:15:55):**  Like you take a piece of land, you buy a lot of the land or most of the land, or maybe  
**[0:15:58-0:15:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:15:58):**  all the land.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:15:59):**  I don't know if that has changed since last year.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:16:01):**  So let's walk us through a case study.  
**[0:16:03-0:16:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:16:03):**  How do you assess which methods to use?  
**[0:16:05-0:16:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:16:05):**  We're talking about crops and trees and biochar and enhanced weathering.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:16:08):**  And then let's unpack a bit how it actually works at scale, because this is not you with  
**[0:16:12-0:16:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:16:12):**  a hammer hitting some rocks until there's powder, or you making a small biochar pile  
**[0:16:16-0:16:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:16:16):**  like this is we're talking different scale and different acres and hectares.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:16:20):**  Like how much land are you currently managing?  
**[0:16:21-0:16:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:16:21):**  And then let's walk through a case study.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:16:23):**  Or let's walk through a concrete one.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:16:25):**  Good question on land, I think more or less, yeah, I think we're approaching 5000 hectares  
**[0:16:29-0:16:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:16:29):**  of land under management.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:16:31):**  Most of that is selected because it's suitable for ecological restoration, which means it's  
**[0:16:36-0:16:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:16:36):**  very degraded, or it has okay, like circumstances, what makes it suitable for?  
**[0:16:41-0:16:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:16:41):**  So typically, it's degraded, what I would class as degraded as an as an ecologist, we'd  
**[0:16:46-0:16:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:16:46):**  look at it and say it's degraded it to somebody else, it might be might be both grazing land,  
**[0:16:50-0:16:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:16:50):**  farmland.  
**[0:16:51-0:16:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:16:51):**  And typically, we don't want arable land.  
**[0:16:55-0:17:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:16:55):**  And we're looking for for lower grade agricultural land.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:17:00):**  And that has historically been forested, because of the price or because you cannot do something  
**[0:17:05-0:17:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:17:05):**  on the airboards not there yet, we can but typically arable land is feeding people and  
**[0:17:10-0:17:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:17:10):**  we don't want to become competitors for for land.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:17:13):**  And this is where we originally looked at our models to ensure that we could be just  
**[0:17:17-0:17:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:17:17):**  as productive.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:17:18):**  And that's where we have the the woolly pigs, the three range pigs out in the forest once  
**[0:17:22-0:17:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:17:22):**  it gets above a certain age.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:17:24):**  And they're, you know, keystone species in a wild boar, a keystone species.  
**[0:17:28-0:17:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:17:28):**  So bringing that into the forest, as long as you keep them on a good rotation is good  
**[0:17:32-0:17:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:17:32):**  for the forest.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:17:33):**  So we try and work with nature on these things.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:17:37):**  So you take the slightly less fancy land, let's say it could be hilly, which used to  
**[0:17:42-0:17:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:17:42):**  be forest or it has been for back back back in the day or some kind of savanna and degraded,  
**[0:17:48-0:17:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:17:48):**  which can still be a current forest as well.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:17:50):**  But it's just very degraded, it could be very degraded forest, maybe, like a Lehman would  
**[0:17:54-0:17:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:17:54):**  look at it and say, but it's actually a forest.  
**[0:17:55-0:17:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:17:55):**  And you were saying about actually, there's a huge potential here.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:17:58):**  It's typically not forest land that we're looking for, because of us being able to generate  
**[0:18:02-0:18:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:18:02):**  carbon credits from reforestation.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:18:05):**  So we're typically looking at land that was deforested, you know, even hundreds, thousands  
**[0:18:08-0:18:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:18:08):**  of years ago, but is suitable to be returned to forest and is relatively unproductive from  
**[0:18:14-0:18:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:18:14):**  an agricultural point of view.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:18:15):**  We don't want to take productive land, arable land, for example, and turn that into forest.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:18:19):**  So some kind of extensive grazing, typically, yes, with very few trees, etc. that have been  
**[0:18:26-0:18:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:18:26):**  not super productive, like underperforming ecosystems, I think the head of Savory, the  
**[0:18:31-0:18:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:18:31):**  Nordics would call that.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:18:32):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:18:33):**  And if you sort of think of it, often it's land that has been sustained by the EU subsidies  
**[0:18:37-0:18:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:18:37):**  model, and really isn't as an economic model.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:18:42):**  The farming on that land doesn't make any money without the subsidies.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:18:46):**  And so it's economically...  
**[0:18:48-0:18:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:18:48):**  And size wise, like normally you buy, it's not a few hectares, like you want.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:18:53):**  What's the minimum just to have, like to make sense to bring in some machinery to bring  
**[0:18:57-0:18:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:18:57):**  in the biochar, etc.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:18:59):**  What's the minimum you normally look at?  
**[0:19:00-0:19:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:19:00):**  So we won't always do the biochar.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:19:02):**  So this is where we've decoupled the model since you and I last spoke.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:19:05):**  So we'd looked at sites where we could produce the biochar on site and things like that previously.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:19:10):**  We're now in some cases looking at where that feedstock sits.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:19:13):**  So working with people who've got waste material.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:19:16):**  So we are locating our first big biochar plant alongside a sawmill, where they've got waste  
**[0:19:23-0:19:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:19:23):**  wood, for example.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:19:24):**  Then we've got land where we can deploy the biochar.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:19:27):**  So we're looking at different models for decoupling these now we've got further forward.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:19:34):**  But with the land, yeah, so the land becomes one sort of component.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:19:40):**  And the other component of that will be peatland restoration, which is not financially that  
**[0:19:45-0:19:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:19:45):**  attractive, but it's something that we will do if it's alongside land.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:19:52):**  And often in Scotland, you get a bundle or a package of land.  
**[0:19:54-0:20:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:19:54):**  So you end up with different scenarios in different parts of that land and forming a  
**[0:20:00-0:20:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:20:00):**  nice mosaic ecosystem.  
**[0:20:03-0:20:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:20:03):**  But typically, we won't look at anything usually under maybe 100 acres.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:20:09):**  So what's that?  
**[0:20:10-0:20:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:20:10):**  50 hectares, something roughly maybe 40 hectares, that would be very small.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:20:18):**  We'd look ideally look for something larger.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:20:22):**  And we have taken smaller areas where they're adjacent to an existing site, and you just  
**[0:20:27-0:20:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:20:27):**  bundle them in so the operating costs don't scale up.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:20:32):**  But we're typically looking for larger, larger tracts of land for that.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:20:37):**  And then what happens?  
**[0:20:39-0:20:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:20:39):**  You should visually imagine this is an overgrazed, hilly landscape, let's say, maybe with some  
**[0:20:43-0:20:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:20:43):**  pockets of trees still somewhere, there might be some water features, etc.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:20:47):**  And then what happens?  
**[0:20:49-0:20:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:20:49):**  How do you approach it from there?  
**[0:20:50-0:20:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:20:50):**  We will then put a plan together for how we would reforest it, how the different aspects,  
**[0:20:55-0:20:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:20:55):**  different climatic conditions are suitable for different trees, put together a mixed  
**[0:20:59-0:21:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:20:59):**  planting scheme and lots of talk of native trees.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:21:03):**  We don't specifically stick with native trees.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:21:06):**  And the reason for that is they're not resilient.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:21:09):**  Which is an interesting concept to begin with.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:21:10):**  We had a long discussion, I think, with Philippe Passani on centropic agroforestry.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:21:15):**  Probably the whole native thing is interesting, let's say.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:21:18):**  The whole weed thing is interesting as well.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:21:19):**  But I will link the interview below if you want to go deeper into that.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:21:22):**  But the concept of native, non-native is interesting in the changing world, or has always been  
**[0:21:27-0:21:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:21:27):**  interesting.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:21:28):**  Yeah, it's always been blurred.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:21:29):**  And it doesn't hold quite as true as people would like to think.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:21:32):**  But then also, in terms of resilience, if we go to two degrees of warming, which we're  
**[0:21:37-0:21:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:21:37):**  almost certainly going to then what would be suitable today on that land?  
**[0:21:42-0:21:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:21:42):**  And what will be suitable at two degrees of warming could be completely different.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:21:44):**  So you make a planning for that?  
**[0:21:46-0:21:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:21:46):**  You model out, okay, what would a forest land?  
**[0:21:49-0:21:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:21:49):**  What would the landscape look like with two degrees in this specific place, etc.  
**[0:21:53-0:21:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:21:53):**  And the difficulty is we don't always know.  
**[0:21:55-0:22:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:21:55):**  So we could see things like the Gulf Stream and North Atlantic currents weaken or move  
**[0:22:03-0:22:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:22:03):**  further south.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:22:05):**  So we're actually planning for cooler climates as well as warmer climates.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:22:09):**  And almost certainly wetter climates on the west coast of Scotland.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:22:13):**  But certainly climates that will, and the reason we like the west coast of Scotland  
**[0:22:17-0:22:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:22:17):**  is not just because it's beautiful and a great place to live and bring up children, but it's  
**[0:22:22-0:22:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:22:22):**  also going to support trees or in all scenarios, all predicted scenarios, will support a good  
**[0:22:29-0:22:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:22:29):**  forested ecosystem well into the future.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:22:35):**  So from a forestry point of view, that's why we try and pick countries.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:22:39):**  And we've stuck with Scotland so far and the north of England.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:22:42):**  So our thesis, if you like, there is high quality, if you're going to do high quality  
**[0:22:47-0:22:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:22:47):**  carbon from trees, and there's lots of lots of disputes as to what's quality from trees  
**[0:22:50-0:22:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:22:50):**  and what's not quality.  
**[0:22:52-0:22:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:22:52):**  But from our point of view, we want to know that that forest will be in place in 100 years  
**[0:22:55-0:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:22:55):**  time.  
**[0:22:56-0:23:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:22:56):**  So we look for a stable social and political system and stable economic system, good rule  
**[0:23:02-0:23:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:23:02):**  of law and climatic conditions that we can be confident will support trees into the future  
**[0:23:11-0:23:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:23:11):**  with all scenarios well into the future.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:23:14):**  So you plan for this reforestation and you bought the land, then how do you finance the  
**[0:23:18-0:23:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:23:18):**  reforestation?  
**[0:23:19-0:23:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:23:19):**  Because that's I mean, you need to get the trees, someone needs to plant them, then maybe  
**[0:23:23-0:23:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:23:23):**  the other models on top as well, if they make sense there, how do you finance the transition  
**[0:23:27-0:23:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:23:27):**  of that land, which has been supported by subsidies?  
**[0:23:30-0:23:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:23:30):**  Yeah, yeah, there is some there is there is sometimes subsidies for the tree planting.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:23:35):**  So we will get some some government investment into that tree planting scheme.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:23:40):**  But we also do tree sponsorships.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:23:43):**  So we have things like a scheme called Trees Not Teas, where we try and replace raised  
**[0:23:49-0:23:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:23:49):**  t shirts.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:23:50):**  So a waste product, which is which is very polluting with a tree instead, and we'll send  
**[0:23:54-0:23:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:23:54):**  a PDF certificate to people so they still get the sponsorship logos on there, they still  
**[0:23:59-0:24:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:23:59):**  get and they often get shared on social media, they'll get a feel good factor and a tree  
**[0:24:04-0:24:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:24:04):**  gets planted rather than a t shirt, which is quite polluting.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:24:06):**  And there's quite a lot of information on the trees not tees website about that, you  
**[0:24:10-0:24:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:24:10):**  know, how polluting a t shirt is, and how bad fast fashion is.  
**[0:24:14-0:24:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:24:14):**  And effectively, that's what's happening with with races.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:24:16):**  Now I run long distance.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:24:18):**  So I'm used to seeing lots of these t shirts given away and everybody who runs and has  
**[0:24:24-0:24:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:24:24):**  jaws full of these free t shirts that are given out to races.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:24:28):**  So it's something that we really need to stop.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:24:32):**  But we also do tree sponsorships to companies.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:24:35):**  I'm not sure which names I can say.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:24:36):**  Don't mention it.  
**[0:24:37-0:24:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:24:37):**  You work with companies.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:24:38):**  Yeah, I'm just gonna stop there.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:24:39):**  Yeah.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:24:40):**  So we work with big companies who want to do good.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:24:43):**  And that can be them come from a tree planting day, as well as some of its education, some  
**[0:24:49-0:24:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:24:49):**  of its feel good, and some of its team building and things like that.  
**[0:24:54-0:24:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:24:54):**  Yeah.  
**[0:24:55-0:24:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:24:55):**  And some people just want to have done have done something good.  
**[0:24:57-0:25:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:24:57):**  So you get the planting supported, sponsored, to a certain extent, that supports the planting.  
**[0:25:04-0:25:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:25:04):**  And then we actually hold on to the carbon credits associated with it, but we'll put  
**[0:25:08-0:25:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:25:08):**  it through a carbon, a carbon scheme.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:25:09):**  So we've got a future asset in the carbon.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:25:12):**  And you hold on the land like you're not planning to sell or flip the land at all?  
**[0:25:16-0:25:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:25:16):**  No.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:25:17):**  And we're now doing our first to make that more scalable.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:25:19):**  We're now doing our first experiments with other landowners.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:25:23):**  So what we've found is it's actually quite difficult for the landowners to do this, you  
**[0:25:27-0:25:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:25:27):**  know, we've built a significant expertise, this is a team with ecologists, forestry  
**[0:25:33-0:25:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:25:33):**  specialists, peatland specialists, and a whole range of skills in that team now.  
**[0:25:40-0:25:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:25:40):**  And so we're also looking at how we work with other landowners, because some of this land,  
**[0:25:46-0:25:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:25:46):**  particularly in Scotland, is locked up in family funds and has been for generations,  
**[0:25:49-0:25:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:25:49):**  they have no wish to sell, they wouldn't, they don't want to sell it, it's a family  
**[0:25:53-0:25:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:25:53):**  heirloom to them.  
**[0:25:55-0:26:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:25:55):**  And so how, but there's a new generation coming through who will be responsible for that land  
**[0:26:01-0:26:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:26:01):**  who want it put to a climate use.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:26:05):**  So we're trying to work out how we work with those partners right now, where we can bring  
**[0:26:11-0:26:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:26:11):**  all the skills and help them develop that land into a better ecosystem, bring back nature,  
**[0:26:18-0:26:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:26:18):**  and at the same time, do something around the carbon asset that we're creating and sharing  
**[0:26:22-0:26:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:26:22):**  that upside that we create for them.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:26:25):**  So that's ongoing, we don't have a clear, a clear proposition there yet.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:26:32):**  And but it's coming.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:26:33):**  It's coming.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:26:34):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:26:35):**  And how important is the ranching or you mentioned the pigs as a keystone species, almost as  
**[0:26:39-0:26:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:26:39):**  a quote unquote tool in the forest.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:26:41):**  We talked last time, I think also a bit about a lot of these places are overgrazed.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:26:45):**  And he said, Yeah, we take some time to take these properties, concentrate the grazing  
**[0:26:49-0:26:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:26:49):**  and the rest we let we work on the reforestation part, not we let reforest, we actually actively  
**[0:26:53-0:26:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:26:53):**  reforest.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:26:54):**  Is that still the case?  
**[0:26:55-0:27:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:26:55):**  Like or have you in terms of said, I don't want to compete on producing food, like is  
**[0:27:01-0:27:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:27:01):**  our animals in rotation or in some cases, are they part of the regeneration in this  
**[0:27:07-0:27:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:27:07):**  case?  
**[0:27:08-0:27:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:27:08):**  Or is that something you have not done?  
**[0:27:09-0:27:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:27:09):**  Yes.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:27:10):**  So yeah, no, no, we have we've moved now.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:27:12):**  So for instance, the site on the island mole, we've changed the species to be more suitable.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:27:16):**  So we've moved to Highland cattle, which are gorgeous, beautiful and fluffy cows for anybody  
**[0:27:23-0:27:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:27:23):**  who's not familiar with them, with big horns, but a very placid, very gentle cows.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:27:28):**  And so we've introduced a small herd of Highland cows there, and that we that we use for for  
**[0:27:34-0:27:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:27:34):**  regenerative, regenerative grazing.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:27:36):**  So basically almost going to a silver pasture system, like the tree and the animal, or is  
**[0:27:40-0:27:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:27:40):**  that a goal at some point?  
**[0:27:41-0:27:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:27:41):**  Like because if we look at the drawdown models, and like that's I wouldn't say the top, top,  
**[0:27:45-0:27:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:27:45):**  top, but it's definitely up there in terms of carbon potential is that integration of  
**[0:27:49-0:27:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:27:49):**  animal and trees, which is not always easy.  
**[0:27:51-0:27:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:27:51):**  Let's not underestimate that.  
**[0:27:53-0:27:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:27:53):**  But if you do it well, it can be a very powerful symbiosis.  
**[0:27:56-0:27:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:27:56):**  Yeah.  
**[0:27:57-0:28:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:27:57):**  And it's a long it's a long process as well, because you need you know, the pigs we can  
**[0:28:02-0:28:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:28:02):**  introduce after we think about seven years in new forest.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:28:08):**  And that's something we've been experimenting with.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:28:10):**  Because otherwise they disrupt the growth significantly.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:28:12):**  Yeah.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:28:13):**  Yeah.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:28:14):**  I mean, but there's a lot of factors in that.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:28:15):**  So so you can put them in with very young trees.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:28:17):**  And if if the grazing pressure is carefully looked after, and you know, the mangalitza  
**[0:28:23-0:28:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:28:23):**  pigs we have are and they're not deep diggers.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:28:27):**  And they will they will dig if they're hungry, but they prefer to graze.  
**[0:28:32-0:28:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:28:32):**  So they won't, we can get them in younger trees, but your your investment into trees,  
**[0:28:39-0:28:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:28:39):**  you don't want that to go wrong.  
**[0:28:40-0:28:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:28:40):**  So you need to be moving.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:28:42):**  It's management, which is key.  
**[0:28:44-0:28:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:28:44):**  Yeah, the management is really important.  
**[0:28:46-0:28:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:28:46):**  And it's the same with with with cows, you don't want cows until the trees are big enough.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:28:50):**  So you know, you're probably looking 20 years before this woodlands are established enough  
**[0:28:53-0:28:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:28:53):**  to be good for grazing now where there's existing woodland, yes, we will, we will selectively  
**[0:28:59-0:29:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:28:59):**  graze through that.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:29:01):**  But we're not really, we're not really farming, we're ecological restoration.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:29:06):**  And we're trying to replace those keystone species that are that are missing, you know,  
**[0:29:12-0:29:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:29:12):**  that would be in the landscape, but managing the grazing in a way that nature would normally  
**[0:29:16-0:29:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:29:16):**  have done with top level predators.  
**[0:29:18-0:29:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:29:18):**  So trying to replicate nature when we when we have a livestock there.  
**[0:29:22-0:29:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:29:22):**  Again, the holistic approach.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:29:23):**  So this is us trying to move to how we you know, we know how to do reforestation and  
**[0:29:28-0:29:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:29:28):**  ecological restoration profitably, and well, and this is us now moving into a phase of  
**[0:29:32-0:29:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:29:32):**  how do we make this scalable?  
**[0:29:34-0:29:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:29:34):**  Because it's difficult when you're very cash intensive to buy the land to ensure that trees  
**[0:29:38-0:29:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:29:38):**  can be there for a long period of time.  
**[0:29:39-0:29:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:29:39):**  But how do you switch that to being something that's truly scalable and rapidly scalable  
**[0:29:43-0:29:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:29:43):**  is that is the challenge we're grappling with at that side.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:29:46):**  The other side, we're scaling much quicker.  
**[0:29:49-0:29:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:29:49):**  And I think that we're getting into that now as well.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:29:51):**  And the enhanced weathering or enhanced rock weathering, you mentioned the biochar, we're  
**[0:29:55-0:29:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:29:55):**  putting that we're currently building a larger facility close to a sawmill, etc.  
**[0:29:59-0:30:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:29:59):**  What is enhanced rock weathering?  
**[0:30:00-0:30:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:30:00):**  I mean, you're taking rocks, but it has to fit, you don't want to probably ship rocks  
**[0:30:03-0:30:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:30:03):**  all over the world.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:30:04):**  So it needs to be somewhere nearby.  
**[0:30:06-0:30:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:30:06):**  And then you have to get it to the certain size, as you mentioned, to the right size  
**[0:30:10-0:30:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:30:10):**  to enable the water to hit as much as possible and for that carbon to lock in.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:30:14):**  How does that work?  
**[0:30:15-0:30:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:30:15):**  So there are certain types of rock we're looking for.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:30:19):**  So specific types of rock and they have different different weathering properties, but they  
**[0:30:23-0:30:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:30:23):**  also have different fertilising properties, if you if you if you view the two, the two  
**[0:30:28-0:30:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:30:28):**  is sort of two sides of the same process.  
**[0:30:31-0:30:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:30:31):**  And we what we what we're doing at the moment is we're actually buying quarry waste.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:30:36):**  So going to quarries for their waste material.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:30:39):**  And we have a there's quite a lot of science before we even will make a purchase where  
**[0:30:45-0:30:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:30:45):**  we are taking samples of the rock.  
**[0:30:47-0:30:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:30:47):**  We're doing mineralogy and chemical testing on it.  
**[0:30:50-0:30:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:30:50):**  We're making sure there aren't high levels of heavy metals.  
**[0:30:53-0:31:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:30:53):**  We're making sure that the CO2 removal levels are high enough to make it commercially worthwhile  
**[0:31:00-0:31:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:31:00):**  for us.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:31:01):**  And we're making sure that this fertiliser benefits and that we understand those fertiliser  
**[0:31:06-0:31:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:31:06):**  benefits.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:31:07):**  And then we will find farms hopefully nearby, work with those farmers.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:31:14):**  There's an education process of what can it do to their land?  
**[0:31:17-0:31:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:31:17):**  What's it going to do to their land?  
**[0:31:19-0:31:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:31:19):**  Because this is on land that you don't own.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:31:21):**  Yes.  
**[0:31:22-0:31:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:31:22):**  It's just the scalable part.  
**[0:31:23-0:31:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:31:23):**  So you're working with farmers, then it has to match what they're growing, I'm imagining,  
**[0:31:26-0:31:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:31:26):**  because we're sort of applying fertiliser here.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:31:28):**  It's a slower release and not so much.  
**[0:31:30-0:31:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:31:30):**  And that's less of a concern because it's quite slow release.  
**[0:31:34-0:31:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:31:34):**  So we're not going to flood their soil with fertiliser.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:31:38):**  And we are going to prevent them needing to put some of the inputs in.  
**[0:31:42-0:31:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:31:42):**  Which is a very big thing looking at current input prices and with the current political  
**[0:31:46-0:31:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:31:46):**  situation, they're probably not going to go down anytime soon.  
**[0:31:49-0:31:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:31:49):**  So if you can replace any inputs, it's huge.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:31:52):**  So you're bringing it to them and then you have to pulverise it or what's a rock crusher?  
**[0:31:57-0:31:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:31:57):**  What does that process look like?  
**[0:31:59-0:32:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:31:59):**  So we're actually at the moment we're taking the waste rock from quarries where...  
**[0:32:03-0:32:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:32:03):**  Which is already...  
**[0:32:04-0:32:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:32:04):**  It's already crushed.  
**[0:32:05-0:32:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:32:05):**  So when a quarry is producing, say, a roadstone or something like that, they look for something  
**[0:32:10-0:32:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:32:10):**  like a 40 mil graded rock.  
**[0:32:12-0:32:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:32:12):**  So it's a particle size is at 40 mil that they're going to put down as a base layer  
**[0:32:18-0:32:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:32:18):**  on a road or a topping layer, which might be a 10 mil graded.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:32:22):**  And every time you break those rocks apart, you're creating dust and you're creating finer  
**[0:32:25-0:32:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:32:25):**  particles.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:32:26):**  Which is perfect for you.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:32:27):**  So we will take the finer materials, we'll sieve it down to the size we want and then  
**[0:32:33-0:32:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:32:33):**  we can take that to direct to farmers without us having to put in grinding energy.  
**[0:32:38-0:32:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:32:38):**  That will scale to quite a large scale over time, but won't be...  
**[0:32:44-0:32:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:32:44):**  Ultimately we probably will need to be grinding material.  
**[0:32:47-0:32:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:32:47):**  We're also looking at other sites where people are extracting large amounts of rock sometimes  
**[0:32:52-0:32:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:32:52):**  to get to other things.  
**[0:32:53-0:32:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:32:53):**  And then the farmer, how does he or she spread it and what should we imagine in terms of  
**[0:32:59-0:33:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:32:59):**  what could it replace in terms of fertilizer input or what would be the benefit of the  
**[0:33:03-0:33:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:33:03):**  farmer, apart from that it's fascinating to be part of this cutting edge science, but  
**[0:33:07-0:33:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:33:07):**  what would be the benefit of a farmer to participate in this and work with you?  
**[0:33:11-0:33:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:33:11):**  Yeah.  
**[0:33:12-0:33:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:33:12):**  So the minerals that they're getting are typically phosphates, potassium, so two of your own  
**[0:33:16-0:33:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:33:16):**  PK, calcium, magnesium.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:33:19):**  There will be trace elements there that they might be missing, selenium, aluminum, iron  
**[0:33:24-0:33:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:33:24):**  in low quantities, but in the quantities that plants need for enzyme development and things  
**[0:33:29-0:33:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:33:29):**  like that.  
**[0:33:30-0:33:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:33:30):**  So we see farmers around the world having to apply some of these trace nutrients where  
**[0:33:36-0:33:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:33:36):**  they've been growing the same crop year after year.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:33:37):**  So farmers will put selenium on, for example, it's there.  
**[0:33:41-0:33:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:33:41):**  It's in very small quantities, but it's there.  
**[0:33:45-0:33:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:33:45):**  And so it can be, depending on the quantity, depending on the rock type, we can be replacing  
**[0:33:51-0:33:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:33:51):**  a lot of those micronutrients into the macronutrients or some proportion of those macronutrients.  
**[0:33:59-0:34:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:33:59):**  So that's the benefit to the farmer.  
**[0:34:03-0:34:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:34:03):**  In terms of spreading it, we are using modified industrial spreading equipment.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:34:11):**  So we've done some pretty large scale trials now, tens of thousands of tons of rock being  
**[0:34:20-0:34:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:34:20):**  spread.  
**[0:34:21-0:34:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:34:21):**  So we know pretty well how to do that.  
**[0:34:24-0:34:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:34:24):**  And we can scale that up now.  
**[0:34:26-0:34:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:34:26):**  And then it releases the fertilizer part, or you're saying that's less of a current  
**[0:34:31-0:34:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:34:31):**  benefit for the farmer or that's something we have to see over the years?  
**[0:34:34-0:34:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:34:34):**  Yeah, they'll see that over years rather than.  
**[0:34:36-0:34:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:34:36):**  So because of your particle distribution, and this is where the model gets really quite  
**[0:34:40-0:34:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:34:40):**  complicated because your particle distribution curve is really important.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:34:44):**  So you've got lots of very small particles in there going up to some quite large particles.  
**[0:34:48-0:34:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:34:48):**  Those very small particles will weather quickly.  
**[0:34:50-0:34:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:34:50):**  So you'll get an initial faster weathering and then slower weathering of the large particles  
**[0:34:54-0:35:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:34:54):**  because the surface area to volume ratio isn't as favourable.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:35:00):**  And as they reduce in size, they'll start to weather quicker as they become smaller  
**[0:35:04-0:35:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:35:04):**  because they've got more surface area to volume ratio.  
**[0:35:08-0:35:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:35:08):**  So there will be an initial release.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:35:10):**  It's unlikely to replace all of the farmers' fertilizer needs.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:35:15):**  And we're keeping our quantities quite low at the moment because we're the first people.  
**[0:35:20-0:35:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:35:20):**  These are the biggest experiments in the world by a long, long way.  
**[0:35:24-0:35:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:35:24):**  And orders of magnitude larger and we're scaling them up.  
**[0:35:28-0:35:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:35:28):**  It's really important that as we do this, we know rock flowers have been used as a treatment  
**[0:35:33-0:35:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:35:33):**  on agriculture for thousands of years.  
**[0:35:37-0:35:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:35:37):**  But we know that we have to get this right.  
**[0:35:40-0:35:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:35:40):**  We have to monitor everything really carefully.  
**[0:35:42-0:35:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:35:42):**  And that's why we've got the science team, the postdoc scientists working in our team  
**[0:35:46-0:35:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:35:46):**  to do the research and monitoring because we need to understand exactly what's happening  
**[0:35:50-0:35:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:35:50):**  in that ecosystem.  
**[0:35:51-0:35:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:35:51):**  We know what happens in the lab.  
**[0:35:53-0:35:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:35:53):**  We need to now see what happens when you do this at large scale in the ecosystem.  
**[0:35:57-0:36:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:35:57):**  And we need to monitor that and measure that because this is a multi-gigaton solution to  
**[0:36:02-0:36:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:36:02):**  climate.  
**[0:36:03-0:36:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:36:03):**  And we need to be doing this at scale.  
**[0:36:07-0:36:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:36:07):**  But we also need to be checking that doing this at scale doesn't have unintended consequences.  
**[0:36:11-0:36:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:36:11):**  And that's a large element of the work we're doing right now.  
**[0:36:14-0:36:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:36:14):**  And it is on arable land.  
**[0:36:16-0:36:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:36:16):**  And grazing.  
**[0:36:17-0:36:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:36:17):**  And grazing.  
**[0:36:18-0:36:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:36:18):**  Yeah.  
**[0:36:19-0:36:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:36:19):**  And so what is the carbon potential?  
**[0:36:21-0:36:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:36:21):**  You mentioned gigatons, but compared to like reforesting that piece of land, which is maybe  
**[0:36:28-0:36:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:36:28):**  not the best solution at the moment because it could be producing food at the moment and  
**[0:36:32-0:36:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:36:32):**  the farmers doing something else.  
**[0:36:33-0:36:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:36:33):**  Like what are the order of magnitudes we're talking about?  
**[0:36:35-0:36:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:36:35):**  Why are you so excited about this on that hectare compared to slow growing trees, et  
**[0:36:40-0:36:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:36:40):**  cetera?  
**[0:36:41-0:36:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:36:41):**  Like what's the excitement for you and from Stripe obviously on this technology?  
**[0:36:44-0:36:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:36:44):**  So it comes back to the fact that we're not competing for land.  
**[0:36:46-0:36:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:36:46):**  One of the big problems with reforestation and we see it particularly in developing countries.  
**[0:36:52-0:36:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:36:52):**  Carbon anyway needs to go back into the soil in arable, in pasture.  
**[0:36:55-0:36:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:36:55):**  And most of the land we see is very, very low on carbon and it has a lot of other benefits  
**[0:36:59-0:37:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:36:59):**  as well.  
**[0:37:00-0:37:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:37:00):**  Yeah.  
**[0:37:01-0:37:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:37:01):**  So you can codeploy these solutions, which is what we were doing with forestry, but you  
**[0:37:05-0:37:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:37:05):**  can codeploy them on land that you can access very easily for spreading.  
**[0:37:09-0:37:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:37:09):**  Land that is actively managed, that is actively monitored.  
**[0:37:12-0:37:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:37:12):**  Then you can increase the scale quite dramatically.  
**[0:37:15-0:37:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:37:15):**  So and we're still going to want to eat.  
**[0:37:18-0:37:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:37:18):**  So we can't just reforest.  
**[0:37:20-0:37:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:37:20):**  We don't eat trees yet.  
**[0:37:21-0:37:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:37:21):**  I mean, we eat a lot of things from trees, from productive trees, et cetera.  
**[0:37:25-0:37:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:37:25):**  And obviously there's an enormous role for perennial agriculture, but unless we completely  
**[0:37:29-0:37:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:37:29):**  get off arable and it's which we might at some point, but not in the near future.  
**[0:37:34-0:37:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:37:34):**  Yeah, we need to work on those pieces of land as well.  
**[0:37:37-0:37:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:37:37):**  And they're in pretty bad shape.  
**[0:37:38-0:37:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:37:38):**  Typically, yes.  
**[0:37:40-0:37:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:37:40):**  And this is inorganic carbon we're storing in the soil, not the organic carbon that regenerative  
**[0:37:45-0:37:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:37:45):**  ag generally focuses on.  
**[0:37:48-0:37:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:37:48):**  So the two can go hand in hand.  
**[0:37:49-0:37:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:37:49):**  Is this sort of as a Kickstarter?  
**[0:37:50-0:37:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:37:50):**  Is it a Kickstarter for a piece of soil?  
**[0:37:53-0:37:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:37:53):**  Do you need to apply it?  
**[0:37:54-0:37:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:37:54):**  Could you apply it regularly?  
**[0:37:55-0:37:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:37:55):**  I mean, these are all open questions I'm imagining.  
**[0:37:57-0:38:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:37:57):**  But is it like a bit of fuel in the engine to start and the whole soil, I wouldn't say  
**[0:38:03-0:38:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:38:03):**  come back to life, but it helps with that process.  
**[0:38:05-0:38:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:38:05):**  Is that how you see it?  
**[0:38:06-0:38:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:38:06):**  It definitely helps because you change the microbial nature of that soil.  
**[0:38:12-0:38:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:38:12):**  So there are it's early research that suggests that you get a benefit in organic carbon as  
**[0:38:18-0:38:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:38:18):**  a result of the increase in inorganic carbon as well.  
**[0:38:21-0:38:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:38:21):**  So as you feed the microbes, if you like, and storing more carbon, it would appear.  
**[0:38:26-0:38:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:38:26):**  But that's not certainly not something that I think we can claim yet.  
**[0:38:31-0:38:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:38:31):**  Claim is an absolute yet.  
**[0:38:34-0:38:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:38:34):**  So yeah, it does help kickstart it, but it's something that you can repeatedly do.  
**[0:38:40-0:38:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:38:40):**  So we think this can be done like an annual fertilizer application.  
**[0:38:44-0:38:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:38:44):**  But we don't know that yet.  
**[0:38:46-0:38:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:38:46):**  And that's again, comes back to our monitoring and the level that we're applying at the moment  
**[0:38:49-0:39:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:38:49):**  is probably about somewhere between 20 and 40 percent of what we what we think we can  
**[0:39:00-0:39:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:39:00):**  apply on an annual basis.  
**[0:39:02-0:39:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:39:02):**  And we're applying that on a three year basis at the moment.  
**[0:39:06-0:39:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:39:06):**  So we're applying this at less than 10 percent of what we think is the right level to do  
**[0:39:12-0:39:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:39:12):**  it when we do it at large scale so that we can get some certainty around it in our smaller  
**[0:39:18-0:39:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:39:18):**  field trails on our science sites.  
**[0:39:20-0:39:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:39:20):**  And this is the benefit of owning land.  
**[0:39:21-0:39:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:39:21):**  We have a whole whole site dedicated just to science where we've just had our labs completed  
**[0:39:28-0:39:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:39:28):**  in cabins that we can now place on that land.  
**[0:39:31-0:39:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:39:31):**  So we've got science labs on site to do the monitoring and to allow us to do rapid soil  
**[0:39:38-0:39:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:39:38):**  testing and things like that.  
**[0:39:40-0:39:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:39:40):**  And there we can do large scale trials at higher quantities because we control the land,  
**[0:39:47-0:39:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:39:47):**  we control the first order streams that are coming off there so we can monitor the water  
**[0:39:50-0:39:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:39:50):**  that's coming off that land, we can monitor changes in the soil, we can control what crops  
**[0:39:54-0:39:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:39:54):**  are going on there.  
**[0:39:55-0:40:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:39:55):**  And that's a huge benefit where when you're working with farmers, you don't want to impact  
**[0:40:01-0:40:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:40:01):**  upon their normal processes.  
**[0:40:03-0:40:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:40:03):**  We want to allow them to, you know, this has to ultimately fit alongside what they already  
**[0:40:06-0:40:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:40:06):**  do if they're going to adopt it at large scale.  
**[0:40:10-0:40:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:40:10):**  We don't want to be saying to them, no, no, you can't grow that crop or you can't do x,  
**[0:40:14-0:40:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:40:14):**  y, z.  
**[0:40:15-0:40:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:40:15):**  They're going to be fitting around their established cycles.  
**[0:40:19-0:40:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:40:19):**  And the more we can do with this, the more I believe we'll encourage them to move towards  
**[0:40:25-0:40:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:40:25):**  regenerative structures as well because as you repair that soil structure, as you repair  
**[0:40:31-0:40:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:40:31):**  the bacteria, fungi, etc. in the soil, it will increase the rate of weathering.  
**[0:40:35-0:40:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:40:35):**  So it's better for us.  
**[0:40:38-0:40:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:40:38):**  But also potentially this gives the farmers a way of applying fertiliser in a regenerative  
**[0:40:44-0:40:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:40:44):**  setting, which they're perhaps struggling for an alternative to chemical fertilisers  
**[0:40:49-0:40:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:40:49):**  for some of these micronutrients.  
**[0:40:50-0:40:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:40:50):**  Yeah.  
**[0:40:51-0:40:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:40:51):**  And as you are selling these credits and they are in demand, especially to early movers  
**[0:40:55-0:40:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:40:55):**  like the stripes of this world, and I think we mentioned like $200 a ton or something  
**[0:40:59-0:41:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:40:59):**  last time, some of that, if you're saying it would even work better if a farmer is starting  
**[0:41:04-0:41:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:41:04):**  to apply certain practices, like the whole process would go faster.  
**[0:41:07-0:41:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:41:07):**  It might even be sort of a transition finance as well.  
**[0:41:10-0:41:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:41:10):**  Like it could be part of that.  
**[0:41:11-0:41:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:41:11):**  Of course, it's paid for the unasked weathering and to apply this on a yearly basis or whatever  
**[0:41:15-0:41:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:41:15):**  cycle makes sense.  
**[0:41:16-0:41:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:41:16):**  But then if you say actually, farmer, if you also start applying this, this and this or  
**[0:41:20-0:41:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:41:20):**  start not doing that, the whole process just go faster.  
**[0:41:23-0:41:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:41:23):**  That would be I mean, that could be this could be a transition finance piece as well.  
**[0:41:27-0:41:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:41:27):**  And the whole it's going to be a cycle up basically, instead of down, which all in the  
**[0:41:32-0:41:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:41:32):**  future talking, but it does symbiotically work together if a farmer changes his or her  
**[0:41:36-0:41:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:41:36):**  practices together with the weathering.  
**[0:41:38-0:41:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:41:38):**  Well certainly whilst fertiliser prices are so high, and I don't think they're ever going  
**[0:41:42-0:41:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:41:42):**  to come down, and we're providing this free to farmers at the moment where we're working.  
**[0:41:46-0:41:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:41:46):**  So we keep the carbon that's part of our model.  
**[0:41:52-0:41:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:41:52):**  But we have been providing them with free fertiliser, which is a huge benefit to them  
**[0:41:59-0:42:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:41:59):**  right now.  
**[0:42:01-0:42:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:42:01):**  And so I don't know quite how that model will develop.  
**[0:42:04-0:42:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:42:04):**  I'd hope that we don't ever have to be charging farmers for this and when there were farmers  
**[0:42:09-0:42:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:42:09):**  already paying for rock before we came onto the scene.  
**[0:42:15-0:42:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:42:15):**  And so they understand in some circles, certainly in the regenerative circles, they understand  
**[0:42:20-0:42:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:42:20):**  the value of this and how it can replace chemical fertilisers.  
**[0:42:25-0:42:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:42:25):**  And that reduces their input.  
**[0:42:27-0:42:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:42:27):**  So it certainly reduces their carbon footprints because they're not having to put those inputs  
**[0:42:33-0:42:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:42:33):**  in and we know that there's downward pressure coming from supermarkets, particularly onto  
**[0:42:37-0:42:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:42:37):**  farmers to reduce their carbon footprints in a sector that's really hard to decarbonise.  
**[0:42:42-0:42:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:42:42):**  It's not obvious.  
**[0:42:45-0:42:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:42:45):**  It's a tough transition.  
**[0:42:46-0:42:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:42:46):**  Yeah, we spent 160 episodes on that.  
**[0:42:50-0:42:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:42:50):**  And to, I wouldn't say put a number on it, but just for people to imagine, like enhanced  
**[0:42:55-0:42:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:42:55):**  weathering in the current science, the current academia, what is the potential?  
**[0:42:59-0:43:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:42:59):**  Of course, it depends on the type of rock, it depends on the type of soil.  
**[0:43:02-0:43:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:43:02):**  But just like this is a gigaton or gigaton solution.  
**[0:43:05-0:43:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:43:05):**  That's why so many people are getting excited about it.  
**[0:43:08-0:43:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:43:08):**  But just to bring that a bit down to earth, because gigatons sound a lot.  
**[0:43:12-0:43:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:43:12):**  How should we imagine in a context on a farm in Scotland, on a hectare or an acre or somewhere  
**[0:43:17-0:43:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:43:17):**  else?  
**[0:43:18-0:43:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:43:18):**  What do you normally talk about if people just have a rough estimate?  
**[0:43:20-0:43:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:43:20):**  Obviously not a ton, an exact behind a comma.  
**[0:43:23-0:43:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:43:23):**  But what do you say as a rough estimate?  
**[0:43:25-0:43:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:43:25):**  Why should people get excited about this?  
**[0:43:27-0:43:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:43:27):**  So I'm trying to do the maths in my head now.  
**[0:43:30-0:43:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:43:30):**  It can probably, it depends on the size of the particles, depends on where we end up  
**[0:43:35-0:43:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:43:35):**  at the end of the science.  
**[0:43:38-0:43:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:43:38):**  But it's tons of carbon per hectare.  
**[0:43:40-0:43:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:43:40):**  Per year?  
**[0:43:41-0:43:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:43:41):**  Per year, potentially.  
**[0:43:42-0:43:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:43:42):**  Wow, which is a significant amount.  
**[0:43:44-0:43:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:43:44):**  Yeah.  
**[0:43:45-0:43:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:43:45):**  But your cost of doing it is quite high.  
**[0:43:47-0:43:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:43:47):**  Of course, you have to bring it in, you have to sieve it, you have to analyse it, you have  
**[0:43:50-0:43:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:43:50):**  to match it, potentially it's not next door, because not everybody has a query, which is  
**[0:43:55-0:43:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:43:55):**  perfectly suited next door, etc, etc.  
**[0:43:58-0:44:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:43:58):**  I think we'll struggle to stay at that $200 a ton price that we did for Stripe initially,  
**[0:44:04-0:44:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:44:04):**  just by the locked in costs in operating.  
**[0:44:08-0:44:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:44:08):**  I think that will have to go quite a bit higher.  
**[0:44:12-0:44:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:44:12):**  Over time, as you get economies of scale kicking in, it might come back down, but it's not  
**[0:44:18-0:44:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:44:18):**  straightforward and a lot of the demand in the market right now is for immediate carbon  
**[0:44:23-0:44:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:44:23):**  and enhanced rock weathering takes multiple years to weather, depending on the particle  
**[0:44:29-0:44:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:44:29):**  size and depending on what we find out as we get further into the science.  
**[0:44:35-0:44:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:44:35):**  It's not a, well, there are no magic bullets in this case with climate, and this isn't  
**[0:44:42-0:44:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:44:42):**  one, but the potential is 2 to 4 billion tons, we think, per year globally.  
**[0:44:50-0:44:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:44:50):**  That's huge.  
**[0:44:51-0:44:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:44:51):**  We're going to need a minimum of 10 billion tons of removal.  
**[0:44:55-0:44:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:44:55):**  That's assuming every sector decarbonises as best we believe it can.  
**[0:44:59-0:45:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:44:59):**  So this is 10 billion.  
**[0:45:01-0:45:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:45:01):**  On top of that decarbonisation, we need about 10 billion tons a year of actual removal,  
**[0:45:07-0:45:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:45:07):**  and this could be a few tons of that, basically.  
**[0:45:10-0:45:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:45:10):**  It could be 20 to 40% of that, yeah.  
**[0:45:12-0:45:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:45:12):**  Which is significant.  
**[0:45:14-0:45:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:45:14):**  Adding on that this is, apart from the biochar, apart from the trees, apart from holistic  
**[0:45:18-0:45:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:45:18):**  grazing, apart from, I mean, this is just the rock weathering.  
**[0:45:22-0:45:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:45:22):**  And this is permanent removal.  
**[0:45:23-0:45:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:45:23):**  This is long-term lockup.  
**[0:45:24-0:45:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:45:24):**  Now, I am a big fan of grazing and soil storage of carbon.  
**[0:45:30-0:45:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:45:30):**  The problem with it is it can be reversed very, very quickly if you have a change of  
**[0:45:33-0:45:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:45:33):**  landscape.  
**[0:45:34-0:45:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:45:34):**  Yeah, one plough and it's one cut of the tree.  
**[0:45:37-0:45:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:45:37):**  Yeah, it's gone.  
**[0:45:38-0:45:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:45:38):**  This once it's done, it's hundreds of thousands of years, millions of years, it goes into  
**[0:45:42-0:45:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:45:42):**  the rock record, and it is locked up.  
**[0:45:44-0:45:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:45:44):**  So in terms of quality of solution, it's absolute best in class.  
**[0:45:49-0:45:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:45:49):**  Now that doesn't mean that other solutions don't have a place to play.  
**[0:45:55-0:46:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:45:55):**  Anything that stores carbon for a period of time, we talk about biochar is 100 year storage,  
**[0:46:01-0:46:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:46:01):**  how much is stored after 100 years.  
**[0:46:03-0:46:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:46:03):**  But the thing is, if you can produce, there's somewhere in the region of 10 billion tons  
**[0:46:06-0:46:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:46:06):**  of biomass that's wasted each year.  
**[0:46:09-0:46:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:46:09):**  If you can turn that into three to four tons of carbon, in fact, some people think it's  
**[0:46:13-0:46:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:46:13):**  high and that some people think it's as much as 20 billion tons of biomass each year.  
**[0:46:17-0:46:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:46:17):**  Which is burned now, mind you, many places or left to rot, etc. and not burned in the  
**[0:46:22-0:46:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:46:22):**  way that it makes biochar.  
**[0:46:23-0:46:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:46:23):**  No, no.  
**[0:46:24-0:46:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:46:24):**  It's burned in a way that it releases everything.  
**[0:46:25-0:46:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:46:25):**  Yeah, it releases everything or worse still, actually, when it rots, often you're releasing  
**[0:46:29-0:46:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:46:29):**  methane as well, which is far more potent as a greenhouse gas.  
**[0:46:33-0:46:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:46:33):**  So when you look at that over 100 years, if you can store, let's say, four gigatons again  
**[0:46:38-0:46:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:46:38):**  of carbon as biochar and get a benefit in the soil, that's a hugely attractive method.  
**[0:46:46-0:46:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:46:46):**  I'm also a fan of what charmer doing with pyrolysis and producing bio oil, which they  
**[0:46:52-0:46:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:46:52):**  inject into oil wells.  
**[0:46:53-0:46:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:46:53):**  That's permanent storage, but it misses the holistic benefits of biochar.  
**[0:46:58-0:47:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:46:58):**  But it does turn it into permanent as opposed to 100 year storage.  
**[0:47:03-0:47:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:47:03):**  I personally think that we're better to use that on dry land, which needs the water moderation.  
**[0:47:08-0:47:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:47:08):**  As biochar than we are as bio oil, but both approaches have merits.  
**[0:47:14-0:47:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:47:14):**  And again, you multiply that up 100 years by four gigatons, and it doesn't stop at 100  
**[0:47:21-0:47:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:47:21):**  years.  
**[0:47:22-0:47:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:47:22):**  It's not like it all suddenly gets released at 100 years.  
**[0:47:24-0:47:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:47:24):**  But you can store and buffer a huge amount of carbon.  
**[0:47:28-0:47:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:47:28):**  And again, with soil, even if soil were only a 10 year buffer, you can still, there's so  
**[0:47:34-0:47:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:47:34):**  much soil that we could be enriching.  
**[0:47:39-0:47:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:47:39):**  And once it's there, and it will hit a point of saturation point, we think, that's certainly  
**[0:47:44-0:47:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:47:44):**  the evidence suggests that there's a saturation point with soil carbon.  
**[0:47:48-0:47:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:47:48):**  But let's get all the soil saturated because it's at least buying us time.  
**[0:47:51-0:47:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:47:51):**  So I'm very much a fan of the, you know, we need to do everything and some of it will  
**[0:47:58-0:48:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:47:58):**  work really well, some of it will work less well, some of it will be really expensive  
**[0:48:01-0:48:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:48:01):**  like direct air capture.  
**[0:48:03-0:48:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:48:03):**  Some of it will have holistic benefits and some won't.  
**[0:48:06-0:48:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:48:06):**  And this is just such a huge problem.  
**[0:48:10-0:48:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:48:10):**  We need to do everything and figure out what works and probably lots of things work.  
**[0:48:16-0:48:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:48:16):**  And what is the biggest struggle or what is the biggest bottleneck at the moment for you  
**[0:48:22-0:48:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:48:22):**  at the Futureforce company?  
**[0:48:24-0:48:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:48:24):**  Apart from scaling a company to 70 people and growing like crazy, I mean, and time and  
**[0:48:28-0:48:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:48:28):**  sleep and all of that, but that's sort of given in a scale up like that.  
**[0:48:33-0:48:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:48:33):**  Small children are probably the biggest barrier to scaling.  
**[0:48:36-0:48:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:48:36):**  No, I joke, but um, get gyms and babysits and support.  
**[0:48:39-0:48:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:48:39):**  Now he has it.  
**[0:48:40-0:48:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:48:40):**  Yeah.  
**[0:48:41-0:48:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:48:41):**  Yeah.  
**[0:48:42-0:48:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:48:42):**  So I think there are various challenges.  
**[0:48:43-0:48:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:48:43):**  I mean, the scale of growth is always a challenge.  
**[0:48:46-0:48:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:48:46):**  We've gone from, I don't know how many people when we last spoke, I think around 20 or so.  
**[0:48:51-0:48:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:48:51):**  In my mind somewhere there's that number, but it wasn't a lot.  
**[0:48:54-0:48:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:48:54):**  Yeah.  
**[0:48:55-0:48:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:48:55):**  So I think I think it might have been less.  
**[0:48:56-0:49:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:48:56):**  And I think in the last 10 months, somebody was telling me we've gone from 10 people to  
**[0:49:00-0:49:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:49:00):**  70 people.  
**[0:49:02-0:49:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:49:02):**  We've got, I think, 17 open positions at the moment.  
**[0:49:04-0:49:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:49:04):**  So please send people to our website.  
**[0:49:06-0:49:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:49:06):**  Have a look at those roles.  
**[0:49:07-0:49:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:49:07):**  We're looking for good people.  
**[0:49:08-0:49:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:49:08):**  Get it touched.  
**[0:49:09-0:49:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:49:09):**  Yeah.  
**[0:49:10-0:49:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:49:10):**  Yeah.  
**[0:49:11-0:49:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:49:11):**  So that's always a challenge.  
**[0:49:13-0:49:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:49:13):**  We're internationalizing at the moment.  
**[0:49:15-0:49:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:49:15):**  So we're building out a team in the US.  
**[0:49:17-0:49:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:49:17):**  And that's, again, just adds another dimension as you start working across those time zones.  
**[0:49:23-0:49:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:49:23):**  And the will be, finance will become a barrier for us.  
**[0:49:29-0:49:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:49:29):**  We're about to go out and start raising a much larger round of investment.  
**[0:49:33-0:49:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:49:33):**  And we haven't disclosed our funding rounds to date, but we have had quite a lot of private  
**[0:49:37-0:49:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:49:37):**  investment into the company.  
**[0:49:41-0:49:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:49:41):**  And we're now looking at how we scale that up significantly.  
**[0:49:46-0:49:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:49:46):**  We have models in place that can go to millions of tons of carbon removal.  
**[0:49:52-0:49:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:49:52):**  We'd like to think we can be the first organization in the world to facilitate billion ton carbon  
**[0:49:57-0:49:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:49:57):**  removal.  
**[0:49:58-0:49:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:49:58):**  That's our North Star.  
**[0:49:59-0:50:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:49:59):**  On a yearly basis or a cumulative?  
**[0:50:00-0:50:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:50:00):**  On an annual basis.  
**[0:50:02-0:50:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:50:02):**  On an annual basis.  
**[0:50:03-0:50:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:50:03):**  Wow.  
**[0:50:04-0:50:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:50:04):**  And that's, to me, is the scale of thinking we need to be applying to this problem now.  
**[0:50:09-0:50:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:50:09):**  And if you look at the latest IPCC report, I've not had a chance to read all 4,000 pages  
**[0:50:14-0:50:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:50:14):**  of it.  
**[0:50:15-0:50:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:50:15):**  It came out yesterday.  
**[0:50:16-0:50:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:50:16):**  Yeah.  
**[0:50:17-0:50:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:50:17):**  It came out yesterday.  
**[0:50:18-0:50:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:50:18):**  Yeah.  
**[0:50:19-0:50:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:50:19):**  But they're finally saying the things that I think a number of us have been saying for  
**[0:50:21-0:50:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:50:21):**  quite a while, that this is actually, the evidence is that this is far worse and happening  
**[0:50:26-0:50:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:50:26):**  far quicker than the media have previously reported.  
**[0:50:31-0:50:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:50:31):**  And if we want to keep a livable planet, or at least large areas of livable planet, we  
**[0:50:38-0:50:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:50:38):**  need to be acting really quickly.  
**[0:50:39-0:50:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:50:39):**  So we just need to do everything, do everything we can.  
**[0:50:44-0:50:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:50:44):**  And when you've got something that's working for us, we have to focus on that.  
**[0:50:49-0:50:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:50:49):**  Scale.  
**[0:50:51-0:50:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:50:51):**  Thank you so much for your time.  
**[0:50:52-0:50:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:50:52):**  Don't keep you any longer because you have a company and a billion tons to reach on any  
**[0:50:56-0:50:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:50:56):**  of your bases.  
**[0:50:57-0:51:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:50:57):**  Thank you so much for checking in with us, sharing the updates.  
**[0:51:00-0:51:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:51:00):**  We'll definitely point to the job openings and the website and obviously the previous  
**[0:51:04-0:51:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:51:04):**  interview if you want to know more.  
**[0:51:06-0:51:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:51:06):**  And if you want to learn more on all of this, definitely point to the website of the Future  
**[0:51:10-0:51:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:51:10):**  Force Company.  
**[0:51:11-0:51:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:51:11):**  So thank you, Jim, so much for your time and your very busy schedule to come and do a catch-up  
**[0:51:15-0:51:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:51:15):**  of where you stand in the regeneration at scale.  
**[0:51:18-0:51:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:51:18):**  It's always a pleasure.  
**[0:51:19-0:51:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:51:19):**  Thank you for having me back.

**[0:53:11-0:53:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:53:11):**  People that are building soil at scale.  
**[0:53:14-0:53:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:53:14):**  And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office

**[0:53:27-0:53:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:53:27):**  No.  
**[0:53:28-0:53:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:53:28):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:53:30-0:53:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:53:30):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you and I'm very aware  
**[0:53:35-0:53:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:53:35):**  that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very different means.  
**[0:53:40-0:53:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:53:40):**  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[0:53:45-0:53:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:53:45):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[0:53:48-0:53:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:53:48):**  Thank you.  
**[0:53:49-0:53:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:53:49):**  So what is this course?  
**[0:53:50-0:53:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:53:50):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  
**[0:53:57-0:53:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:53:57):**  so you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:53:58-0:54:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:53:58):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:54:03-0:54:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:54:03):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:54:09-0:54:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:54:09):**  invest in, what kind of co investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[0:54:14-0:54:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:54:14):**  if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:54:15-0:54:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:54:15):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:54:20-0:54:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:54:20):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:54:24-0:54:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:54:24):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:54:29-0:54:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:54:29):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:54:30-0:54:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:54:30):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:54:32-0:54:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:54:32):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:54:34-0:54:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:54:34):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:54:38-0:54:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:54:38):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:54:40-0:54:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:54:40):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.  
**[0:54:45-0:54:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann-2#t=0:54:45):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking.

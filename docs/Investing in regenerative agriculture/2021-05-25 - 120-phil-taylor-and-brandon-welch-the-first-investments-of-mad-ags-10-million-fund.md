**[0:00:13-0:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:00:13):**  A long overdue check-in interview with Phil Taylor and Brandon Welch of the Perennial  
**[0:00:19-0:00:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:00:19):**  Fund and Med Agriculture.  
**[0:00:20-0:00:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:00:20):**  They just closed their fund in February on 10 million dollars and the first four loans  
**[0:00:25-0:00:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:00:25):**  are out of the door already with many more to come.  
**[0:00:28-0:00:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:00:28):**  So what have they learned about skin in the game transition finance and partnering with  
**[0:00:33-0:00:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:00:33):**  farmers?  
**[0:00:36-0:00:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:00:36):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:00:40-0:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:00:40):**  Investing as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:42-0:00:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:00:42):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:46-0:00:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:00:46):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:00:51-0:00:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:00:51):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:56-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:00:56):**  Why my focus on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:58-0:01:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:00:58):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:02-0:01:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:01:02):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:04-0:01:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:01:04):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small and consumers, start paying much more  
**[0:01:09-0:01:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:01:09):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:13-0:01:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:01:13):**  In March last year, we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support

**[0:01:38-0:01:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:01:38):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:01:40):**  Welcome to another episode today with Brendan and Phil of Mad Agriculture and Perennial  
**[0:01:45-0:01:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:01:45):**  Fund.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:01:46):**  We interviewed them once before.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:01:48):**  Actually Brendan and I interviewed a while back as well in 2019.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:01:51):**  We had them as one of the participants in the series of transition finance for farmers  
**[0:01:55-0:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:01:55):**  with Benedict, I think a year ago or probably a bit later, like 10 months ago or something.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:02:02):**  And we of course had a webinar with you very recently and also Q&A webinar, I think a year  
**[0:02:07-0:02:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:02:07):**  ago.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:02:08):**  So you have been on the show multiple times.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:02:09):**  The Perennial Fund has been in transition, funny enough, multiple times as well.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:02:13):**  But I was really happy to sit down with you today and have a check in to see where you're  
**[0:02:18-0:02:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:02:18):**  at where in April 2021 to get a bit of a download.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:02:22):**  If you're interested in the Perennial Fund in general, the background, et cetera, I will  
**[0:02:25-0:02:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:02:25):**  refer to all the previous episodes in the show notes below, but I'm very happy to check  
**[0:02:29-0:02:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:02:29):**  in with you, Brendan and Phil, to see where you're at, what's happening, what have you  
**[0:02:34-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:02:34):**  learning, what has been surprising to you and much more.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:02:37):**  Good to be here.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:02:38):**  Yeah, we always love being on the podcast and conversation and are happy to be here  
**[0:02:42-0:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:02:42):**  and fill you in with what's going on.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:02:44):**  Likewise, it's been great to be on the journey together.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:02:47):**  And so if you had to give a short update of what is happening at the moment, what's April  
**[0:02:51-0:02:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:02:51):**  been like for the Perennial Fund, what would you say?  
**[0:02:55-0:02:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:02:55):**  Really getting the work done.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:02:57):**  We closed the fund in February at $10 million from 43 investors.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:03:02):**  Congrats there with that.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:03:03):**  Thank you so much.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:03:04):**  Yeah.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:03:05):**  Spanning seven countries.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:03:07):**  We've got 97 farmers in the pipeline.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:03:10):**  We're talking with about 20 to 25 of them.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:03:13):**  And we've just made our first four loans over the last couple of months.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:03:17):**  So now that we are actually drafting documents, starting to distribute loans out, we're learning  
**[0:03:25-0:03:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:03:25):**  quite a bit, testing a lot of assumptions, making sure that we're still being concrete  
**[0:03:30-0:03:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:03:30):**  in the mission and vision and where we're headed, but kind of being plastic and flexible  
**[0:03:34-0:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:03:34):**  in terms of how we get there and making sure that we're creating something truly useful  
**[0:03:39-0:03:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:03:39):**  for those that we're here to serve, which are farmers transitioning to regenerative  
**[0:03:44-0:03:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:03:44):**  organic.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:03:45):**  So there's a lot of details I'm sure we could dig into, like talk about the research project  
**[0:03:50-0:03:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:03:50):**  and documentary film crew we're using to help document the transition of many of these farmers,  
**[0:03:56-0:03:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:03:56):**  nuances on the loans.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:03:58):**  We can really take it any direction they'd like.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:04:01):**  I would like to unpack all of those.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:04:03):**  Let's start with the nuances on loans.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:04:05):**  Maybe one of those four or four, if they're different, like the loans that went out already  
**[0:04:09-0:04:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:04:09):**  just to describe what you're exactly funding now and maybe also how that's different from  
**[0:04:14-0:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:04:14):**  when we talked 10 months ago or if it's different at all, obviously.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:04:18):**  Yeah.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:04:19):**  So what we're exactly funding on all the farms are production costs.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:04:23):**  So basically providing all of the liquidity that farmers need and the cash that they need  
**[0:04:29-0:04:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:04:29):**  upfront to plant their crop, to manage it throughout the season and then to harvest  
**[0:04:33-0:04:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:04:33):**  it at the end of the year.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:04:35):**  So these are costs like rent, crop insurance, seeds, diesel, labor, unexpected tractor breakdowns,  
**[0:04:44-0:04:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:04:44):**  anything they need throughout the year because there's a massive cash flow gap between when  
**[0:04:48-0:04:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:04:48):**  a seed goes in the ground, all of the cash that a farmer is constantly spending every  
**[0:04:53-0:04:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:04:53):**  single day and then that harvest when they actually have the crop in hand and that one  
**[0:04:58-0:05:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:04:58):**  revenue that comes in on the back end of the year where they then have the cash to pay  
**[0:05:03-0:05:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:05:03):**  back kind of this big credit card that we're essentially giving them.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:05:07):**  So we're funding all the production costs on these farms on transitional acres, organic  
**[0:05:12-0:05:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:05:12):**  acres and conventional acres that are soon to transition to organic.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:05:17):**  That's a little different than we initially outlined.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:05:19):**  Initially, we were just gunning for funding the transitional ground.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:05:24):**  We found it very cumbersome to engage with many of these community bankers who are very  
**[0:05:31-0:05:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:05:31):**  unfamiliar in partnering with another financial institution and coming up alongside another  
**[0:05:36-0:05:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:05:36):**  financing partner.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:05:37):**  They always want to be on first.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:05:39):**  That's how they say it.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:05:40):**  We want to have first rights to all the collateral and as long as you're coming in second, we'd  
**[0:05:45-0:05:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:05:45):**  be okay.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:05:46):**  They'd be okay with us coming in behind them.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:05:48):**  But in many instances, we haven't found anyone willing to appropriately share risk and actually  
**[0:05:56-0:06:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:05:56):**  truly partner to help these farmers transition their full farm to 100% organic.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:06:02):**  So on these loans specifically, some of the nuances that we've changed from the outset  
**[0:06:08-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:06:08):**  is we initially intended to do a straight revenue share through both transition and  
**[0:06:15-0:06:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:06:15):**  organic years.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:06:17):**  We've had some pushback from initial farmers that the revenue share is great in kind of  
**[0:06:23-0:06:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:06:23):**  its ethic and the goal of kind of shaping debt in the form of equity by sharing upside  
**[0:06:29-0:06:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:06:29):**  and downside.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:06:30):**  But at the end of the day, we found that many of these farmers just want to know what their  
**[0:06:35-0:06:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:06:35):**  payment is and they just want to have a payment schedule of, I'm going to pay $1 in 2021,  
**[0:06:40-0:06:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:06:40):**  $1.50 in 2022 and they have it laid out in terms of what they need to know and what they  
**[0:06:47-0:06:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:06:47):**  need to shoot for.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:06:48):**  A revenue share is a little too nebulous.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:06:51):**  Maybe that was our ability to educate them on a revenue share, communicate that.  
**[0:06:55-0:07:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:06:55):**  So all four loans are not a revenue share now or some are, some are not.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:07:00):**  Because you would imagine farmers would be interested to share the risk and not be on  
**[0:07:05-0:07:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:07:05):**  the riskier side of the equation when it comes to a straight loan.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:07:08):**  But you're seeing that that's not the case, or at least the farmers you talk to and end  
**[0:07:11-0:07:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:07:11):**  up working with.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:07:12):**  So three of the loans are revenue share.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:07:15):**  One is a straight APR.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:07:16):**  What's APR for anybody know?  
**[0:07:18-0:07:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:07:18):**  7%.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:07:19):**  No, I mean as a term.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:07:21):**  Annual percentage rate.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:07:22):**  Okay.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:07:23):**  So that's interesting.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:07:24):**  One in which still is 75% is a revenue share.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:07:27):**  That's still interesting as a hit rate basically.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:07:30):**  It's been interesting just kind of, I mean Brandon has been testing a ton of different  
**[0:07:33-0:07:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:07:33):**  models around sort of the loan structure.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:07:36):**  And it reminds me a little bit of like what a leading brand might do with consumers, right?  
**[0:07:40-0:07:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:07:40):**  Like there's sort of a market standard for what people want to eat and expect from a  
**[0:07:44-0:07:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:07:44):**  brand.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:07:45):**  And then there's also simultaneously educating the consumer on what they should be purchasing.  
**[0:07:50-0:07:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:07:50):**  And so there's sort of this interesting tension between offering what is comfortable by the  
**[0:07:54-0:07:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:07:54):**  consumer so to speak, or the borrower, and then also kind of pressing the limit and saying,  
**[0:07:59-0:08:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:07:59):**  this is actually, we actually think this is better for you, shared risk for shared reward.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:08:04):**  And then it's sometimes can be too unfamiliar.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:08:06):**  So the borrower is like, yeah, I don't want that.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:08:08):**  So there's an interesting kind of tension that we're finding pushing the innovation  
**[0:08:12-0:08:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:08:12):**  and then doing what is sort of more normal.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:08:15):**  Yeah, because these first three loans that we did on a revenue share, farmers were so  
**[0:08:19-0:08:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:08:19):**  bought in and values aligned and just truly wanted to work with Mad Ag that they were  
**[0:08:24-0:08:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:08:24):**  willing to make it work even though there was some pushback.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:08:27):**  So now we've been redrafting some loan documents, setting up all the different types of nuances  
**[0:08:33-0:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:08:33):**  in those docs to actually account for standard APR.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:08:36):**  And we were able to do our last loan, the fourth one with a straight APR.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:08:41):**  And I would say the next five or six or so farms that are in the queue that were set  
**[0:08:45-0:08:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:08:45):**  to draft docs and fund within the next three weeks, four weeks or so.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:08:51):**  Those are all standard APRs.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:08:53):**  And is there any kind of flexibility built into that any kind of risk sharing?  
**[0:08:57-0:09:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:08:57):**  How did you still brought some of the values of the revenue share into a relatively straight  
**[0:09:04-0:09:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:09:04):**  loan, basically?  
**[0:09:06-0:09:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:09:06):**  Or were you able to do something there?  
**[0:09:08-0:09:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:09:08):**  Yeah, so what we were able to integrate was a minimum targeted payment.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:09:12):**  So based on how these farmers have previously transitioned ground, we have numbers on what  
**[0:09:17-0:09:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:09:17):**  their expected yield and market price that they're able to receive is.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:09:22):**  From there, we're able to back out what their expected revenues are on transitional  
**[0:09:26-0:09:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:09:26):**  acre.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:09:27):**  We can see their expected loss.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:09:29):**  And then we're able to work with them to co-agree on a minimum targeted payment on  
**[0:09:34-0:09:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:09:34):**  their future transitional ground to ensure that they're not going to sink the ship and  
**[0:09:39-0:09:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:09:39):**  go bankrupt during transition, but they're actually going to be able to make this payment  
**[0:09:43-0:09:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:09:43):**  schedule.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:09:44):**  So what we're doing is the schedule outlines the minimum targeted payments.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:09:48):**  They can pay more if they'd like.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:09:49):**  We then take that balance over the top, which is usually less than the principal route laying.  
**[0:09:54-0:09:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:09:54):**  We roll that over year over year as they're transitioning that ground until they hit certified  
**[0:09:59-0:10:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:09:59):**  organic.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:10:00):**  And once they hit certified organic, they essentially pay that down over the next three  
**[0:10:05-0:10:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:10:05):**  to five years because we convert it into just an amortized term note so that we can then  
**[0:10:10-0:10:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:10:10):**  spread out that schedule over time.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:10:13):**  And then we can continue funding them on their regular operating needs once they've hit  
**[0:10:17-0:10:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:10:17):**  certified organic.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:10:19):**  That way we can keep working with them, building our relationship.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:10:22):**  And many of these farmers are continuing to expand their operation, take on more conventional  
**[0:10:27-0:10:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:10:27):**  ground and transition it.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:10:29):**  So we'll just keep doubling down on our partnerships and relationships with our on the ground farmers  
**[0:10:35-0:10:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:10:35):**  that are doing the work.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:10:36):**  Once you lift the hood on a farm and understand the vision of the farm, there's always sort  
**[0:10:41-0:10:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:10:41):**  of a need to purchase land or there's need to build infrastructure around storage, or  
**[0:10:47-0:10:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:10:47):**  maybe they want to value add and vertically integrate and they have a vision for a mill.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:10:50):**  And that all requires catalytic financing.  
**[0:10:54-0:10:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:10:54):**  And so that's an area where I think Mad Ag will grow into and we'll also grow into finding  
**[0:10:59-0:11:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:10:59):**  partners.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:11:00):**  We've been working with Iroquois Valley on several different opportunities and they're  
**[0:11:03-0:11:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:11:03):**  just a fantastic outfit.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:11:05):**  So there are some mission aligned finance out there in the region space where we can  
**[0:11:10-0:11:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:11:10):**  even de-risk these opportunities by kind of stacking, you know, more diversified capital  
**[0:11:15-0:11:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:11:15):**  stack in the future.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:11:16):**  We're not, we're just sort of visioning about that, but the need is extremely high in the  
**[0:11:21-0:11:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:11:21):**  region movement to have financing that serves many different needs.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:11:25):**  And so we're sticking to production costs, but in the future, that's an area where I  
**[0:11:29-0:11:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:11:29):**  think we can expand to build on your last question.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:11:32):**  In addition to the minimum targeted payment, the other bit of flexibility that is pretty  
**[0:11:38-0:11:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:11:38):**  core to the loan is the ability for a farmer to defer a payment if they need to.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:11:43):**  So if they end up getting wiped out by hail, if the market tanks and they're not covered,  
**[0:11:48-0:11:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:11:48):**  let's say they don't have the right insurance mechanism to cover it, they can kick out that  
**[0:11:52-0:11:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:11:52):**  payment an additional year.  
**[0:11:54-0:11:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:11:54):**  And they have up to two opportunities to do that throughout the life of the loan.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:11:58):**  So many of our loans are structured on a five to eight year term from where we commit to  
**[0:12:03-0:12:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:12:03):**  outlying capital and then having them pay back the loan in full.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:12:07):**  During that time period, there's a deferral so they can have flexibility on that payment  
**[0:12:11-0:12:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:12:11):**  amount.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:12:12):**  There's no additional penalty for that.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:12:14):**  Just like if they were to pay early, there's also no additional penalty.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:12:17):**  It'd be great if our loans could be paid off early.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:12:20):**  That's cash back into the fund and we can then revolve that, outlay it to additional  
**[0:12:25-0:12:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:12:25):**  farmers to transition ground.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:12:28):**  So minimum targeted payment, deferral and our other services that we're also trying  
**[0:12:33-0:12:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:12:33):**  to couple into the loan as well are pretty, I think, just values aligned and good kind  
**[0:12:37-0:12:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:12:37):**  of premiums that are being gifted to these farmers.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:12:42):**  Like what are the services that we always talk to about the market access and the community,  
**[0:12:47-0:12:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:12:47):**  the community of peers and a community of technology support or let's say transition  
**[0:12:52-0:12:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:12:52):**  support.  
**[0:12:53-0:12:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:12:53):**  What have you seen, what has been requested the most, what have been most popular of the  
**[0:12:57-0:13:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:12:57):**  whole suite of tools you can offer to farmers and partners you're working with?  
**[0:13:02-0:13:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:13:02):**  Great question.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:13:03):**  You know, MAD agriculture as an organisation aspires to really empower farmers that are  
**[0:13:07-0:13:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:13:07):**  hungry to change and aspire to regenerative ag and organic agriculture.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:13:11):**  And we support that with a mixture of land and business planning, capital and markets.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:13:18):**  And so, you know, the perennial fund, it's easy to think about it as a financing vehicle,  
**[0:13:23-0:13:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:13:23):**  which it is.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:13:24):**  There's sort of the word fund in the name.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:13:26):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:13:27):**  But it brings, exactly.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:13:28):**  Now, it's no surprise that people think about financing when there's a fund, but the underlying  
**[0:13:34-0:13:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:13:34):**  kind of support we offer is in this kind of land and business planning as well as markets.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:13:38):**  And, you know, we were talking about it earlier where, you know, some farmers need land and  
**[0:13:42-0:13:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:13:42):**  business planning, some farmers need capital, some farmers need Facebook account, but every  
**[0:13:47-0:13:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:13:47):**  farmer needs a market.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:13:48):**  And so the market request is really high with the farmers.  
**[0:13:52-0:13:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:13:52):**  And to be quite frank, the ambition and progress to decommodify the food system where we move  
**[0:13:58-0:14:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:13:58):**  out of corn, beans and alfalfa and other big monoculture, stable crops is such a lofty  
**[0:14:04-0:14:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:14:04):**  goal which we hold ardently to.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:14:07):**  And so we're just sort of putting cracks in the system right now.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:14:11):**  You know, right now we're trialing 10 acres over here, 50 acres over here of crops that  
**[0:14:16-0:14:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:14:16):**  may have maybe never even grown there.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:14:18):**  Maybe they grew there 100 years ago or maybe, you know, there's just an emerging market  
**[0:14:23-0:14:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:14:23):**  for them.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:14:24):**  And so we're in the midst of working based on a farm-by-farm basis to really understand  
**[0:14:29-0:14:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:14:29):**  what that farm ecosystem and that rotation can be.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:14:33):**  And for us, the regeneration of the land and human wellbeing is wrapped up and that regeneration  
**[0:14:40-0:14:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:14:40):**  foremost is driven by diversity.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:14:42):**  And so the more that we can diversify the farm ecosystem in terms of not only the wild  
**[0:14:47-0:14:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:14:47):**  spaces that it has and can nurture, but also the cultivated spaces.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:14:52):**  And the people on it.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:14:53):**  Yeah.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:14:54):**  Yeah.  
**[0:14:55-0:14:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:14:55):**  And then the people on it, obviously.  
**[0:14:56-0:14:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:14:56):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:14:57-0:14:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:14:57):**  So we use our markets to do that work.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:14:59):**  Regeneration is severely limited by the lack of diversity in markets.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:15:02):**  And so that's kind of the biggest request that we get from farmers.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:15:06):**  But we're also sort of limited in what we can do.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:15:09):**  We're building out our team right now.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:15:10):**  We're hiring hopefully two people in the next two months to really build that out.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:15:15):**  And we're basically hiring two different roles.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:15:18):**  One that kind of stewards the social capital of the movement, builds alliances with brands  
**[0:15:23-0:15:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:15:23):**  and can inspire economic transactions, long-term partnerships with farmers.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:15:28):**  And then there's a second person we're hiring that's going to be more focused on sort of  
**[0:15:31-0:15:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:15:31):**  the supply shed building, right?  
**[0:15:34-0:15:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:15:34):**  Like the person getting the deal done, the contracting, the delivery, the QA, QC, and  
**[0:15:39-0:15:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:15:39):**  all of that work.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:15:40):**  So market is a big thing.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:15:41):**  We also support with land and business planning.  
**[0:15:44-0:15:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:15:44):**  We're just growing in that realm.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:15:46):**  Farm ecosystems are extraordinarily complex.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:15:49):**  They might all look the same from the road, but they're very different when you get to  
**[0:15:53-0:15:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:15:53):**  know the family, the story, the lineage.  
**[0:15:56-0:16:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:15:56):**  And there are commonalities like markets, but in terms of where that farm is going,  
**[0:16:00-0:16:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:16:00):**  who stewards the farm, their attention to place and all of that ends up being quite  
**[0:16:05-0:16:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:16:05):**  complicated.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:16:06):**  So we have a team that can help farmers sort through that complexity and chaos and really  
**[0:16:11-0:16:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:16:11):**  figure out where to put their best foot forward and support with developing a grazing plan,  
**[0:16:16-0:16:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:16:16):**  developing a new rotation, all of those kinds of the guts of the farm operation.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:16:20):**  So those are the areas where we help.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:16:23):**  The last thing I'll mention before I stop my rant is just the community building, right?  
**[0:16:28-0:16:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:16:28):**  Like there's just an extraordinary amount of power in being part of a movement together,  
**[0:16:33-0:16:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:16:33):**  right?  
**[0:16:34-0:16:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:16:34):**  That's what gives us meaning and purpose.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:16:35):**  That's why I love connecting with you, Coon.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:16:38):**  Like we're living together for something larger than ourselves.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:16:41):**  It gives us purpose and color, as Benedict would say, color to our face.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:16:46):**  And I think that that's what these farmers also long for.  
**[0:16:50-0:16:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:16:50):**  It's a fundamental human need.  
**[0:16:52-0:16:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:16:52):**  And so most of the farmers we work with are isolated geographically, ideologically, and  
**[0:16:58-0:17:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:16:58):**  by connecting them to that broader movement through other farmers that we work with, they  
**[0:17:02-0:17:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:17:02):**  kind of get a sense of like, wow, we can do this, you know, and it enlivens them.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:17:08):**  And so a lot of our work at its core is about enlivening the spirit and empowering the kind  
**[0:17:15-0:17:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:17:15):**  of like untapped into agency of the person.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:17:19):**  Like how do you get someone to come alive and work from that place of belonging?  
**[0:17:25-0:17:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:17:25):**  And you know, I think we're trying our hardest to sort of develop the right human approach  
**[0:17:29-0:17:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:17:29):**  to do that, because that's really where all change happens.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:17:32):**  It changes in the transformation of every individual from the inside out.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:17:37):**  And that's the most durable change.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:17:38):**  It's grassroots, it's farmer to farmer, it's community based.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:17:42):**  And that's built into the Perennial Fund.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:17:44):**  I mean, our farmers gather, they work, they help each other already.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:17:48):**  That's happening.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:17:49):**  Do you have an example of that?  
**[0:17:50-0:17:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:17:50):**  Yeah, we have an example of where, you know, one farmer who just received the loan is immediately  
**[0:17:54-0:17:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:17:54):**  asking us, where do I find feed for my animals?  
**[0:17:57-0:17:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:17:57):**  I'm looking for high quality rye.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:17:59):**  And then, you know, email Jared, who's our farm lending lead.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:18:03):**  And Jared, within like a couple minutes had been on phone with another farmer.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:18:06):**  They're connecting and now they're in an economic relationship, a friendship relationship.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:18:11):**  And so that's already kind of moving and grooving within moments.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:18:15):**  With four farmers in the program, which is very, very, like the chances that you find  
**[0:18:21-0:18:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:18:21):**  the supply for the demand or the other way around in with four farmers is fascinatingly  
**[0:18:25-0:18:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:18:25):**  low, but still it happened.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:18:27):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:18:28):**  So yeah, I would just say I would wrap up all that by saying that, you know, we need  
**[0:18:32-0:18:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:18:32):**  a system level revolution.  
**[0:18:34-0:18:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:18:34):**  And part of what Mad Ag tries to hold, bring holistically are what we think are the most  
**[0:18:40-0:18:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:18:40):**  important kind of nodal points to change the system, right?  
**[0:18:43-0:18:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:18:43):**  Like you can't think about financing without thinking about how you're going to pay it  
**[0:18:46-0:18:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:18:46):**  back, which is markets.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:18:47):**  You can't think about developing a market if you don't think about the farm ecosystem  
**[0:18:51-0:18:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:18:51):**  what the land needs in terms of a crop rotation.  
**[0:18:54-0:18:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:18:54):**  You can't think about the crop rotation if you don't think about the long-term balance  
**[0:18:57-0:18:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:18:57):**  sheet and the business plan.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:18:59):**  And those are the, if you can't think about those dynamically, you end up getting kind  
**[0:19:03-0:19:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:19:03):**  of stuck.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:19:04):**  And so Mad Ag, you know, holds that ecosystem of offerings while also pointing to all the  
**[0:19:11-0:19:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:19:11):**  other good stuff out there.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:19:12):**  We're not best suited to always help with something.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:19:15):**  So that's why we point to a partner.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:19:16):**  It's like we can't buy land with a farmer and so we'll put in the Iroquois Valley.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:19:21):**  So there's, you know, that kind of platform ecosystem approach invites just an extraordinary  
**[0:19:27-0:19:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:19:27):**  amount of partnership, right, in movement building because we're just constantly pushing  
**[0:19:33-0:19:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:19:33):**  opportunities to everyone else that shares our values, which is part of the beauty of  
**[0:19:38-0:19:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:19:38):**  it.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:19:39):**  And I think many people, I'm speaking for myself, but also I'm sure for others, have  
**[0:19:44-0:19:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:19:44):**  listened to previous episodes with you and have seen you in many places and read, and  
**[0:19:48-0:19:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:19:48):**  now seen the 10 million closing.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:19:51):**  What would you say to them for others that have been inspired in other places around?  
**[0:19:54-0:19:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:19:54):**  Because all of my vision is, or my hope is that we'll see many, many, many different  
**[0:19:59-0:20:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:19:59):**  perennial funds between brackets in the local context, in Eastern Germany, in Northern Netherlands,  
**[0:20:05-0:20:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:20:05):**  in India, many different regions that we need and holistic approach to transition agriculture  
**[0:20:11-0:20:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:20:11):**  almost everywhere, probably everywhere.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:20:13):**  What would be your advice to them?  
**[0:20:15-0:20:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:20:15):**  Like, if this is such an enormous task to set up something like that, what would be  
**[0:20:20-0:20:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:20:20):**  first step, second step?  
**[0:20:21-0:20:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:20:21):**  But where would you start wanting to say, okay, we need something like MADAC and perennial  
**[0:20:26-0:20:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:20:26):**  fund also in France?  
**[0:20:28-0:20:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:20:28):**  Okay.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:20:29):**  And then where do I even begin?  
**[0:20:30-0:20:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:20:30):**  That's a good question.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:20:32):**  I think a pretty simple piece of advice that would work is don't start.  
**[0:20:38-0:20:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:20:38):**  Don't start one.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:20:41):**  Step two, to find farmers, to build authentic relationships with them, and to listen to  
**[0:20:50-0:20:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:20:50):**  them, to listen to what are their problems?  
**[0:20:52-0:20:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:20:52):**  What are they struggling with?  
**[0:20:54-0:20:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:20:54):**  And just hear out where are their frustration?  
**[0:20:57-0:20:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:20:57):**  Where's their confusion?  
**[0:20:58-0:21:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:20:58):**  Where's the friction that they're rubbing up against that it's too large for them to  
**[0:21:02-0:21:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:21:02):**  somehow surmount and then allow them to level up their farm?  
**[0:21:06-0:21:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:21:06):**  I mean, that's where we started was with the pioneering ones, right?  
**[0:21:10-0:21:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:21:10):**  Very deliberately, you're partnering with the ones that are the front runners of this  
**[0:21:15-0:21:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:21:15):**  movement to double down on them and help them sort of pull and push in all different ways  
**[0:21:20-0:21:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:21:20):**  the rest.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:21:21):**  But you're not going for the ones that are thinking, maybe I should go regen or should  
**[0:21:25-0:21:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:21:25):**  do something on different cover crops.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:21:27):**  No, you're doubling down on the pioneers.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:21:28):**  Would it be your advice as well?  
**[0:21:30-0:21:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:21:30):**  I don't know.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:21:31):**  I think in the United States, that's probably the case if we're going to kind of follow  
**[0:21:35-0:21:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:21:35):**  the curve of diffusion.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:21:36):**  And, you know, right now it's a hypothesis.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:21:38):**  I mean, it's a theory that if we double down on these pioneering, the leading farmers,  
**[0:21:43-0:21:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:21:43):**  these folks that are setting an example that are inspirational, that they mentally have  
**[0:21:47-0:21:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:21:47):**  made the switch.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:21:48):**  They are practicing agriculture in a way that's building soil.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:21:52):**  But now they just need the tools to keep doing it at a larger scale or to do it better.  
**[0:21:57-0:21:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:21:57):**  That's our theory here in the US.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:21:59):**  Whether that is the case in the Netherlands or Australia or India, I don't know.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:22:05):**  And that's why my advice would be for people to talk with as many farmers as possible,  
**[0:22:10-0:22:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:22:10):**  to listen to them.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:22:12):**  And I think naturally through that process, they're going to start kind of sifting and  
**[0:22:15-0:22:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:22:15):**  filtering through the noise.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:22:17):**  They'll see the signals and the patterns that will emerge and they'll start seeing who the  
**[0:22:21-0:22:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:22:21):**  leaders are in their own context, because the leaders here in, let's say, Iowa or Colorado  
**[0:22:28-0:22:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:22:28):**  probably look very different than leaders in South Africa or the Middle East or anywhere  
**[0:22:33-0:22:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:22:33):**  else globally.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:22:34):**  So listening is the most important piece.  
**[0:22:37-0:22:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:22:37):**  Kind of using design thinking, empathy interviews, just being really present to hearing their  
**[0:22:42-0:22:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:22:42):**  problems.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:22:43):**  Because a piece of advice that I got really early on from one of my first mentors, Rick  
**[0:22:48-0:22:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:22:48):**  Adcock, was the world is awash with money.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:22:51):**  Money is everywhere.  
**[0:22:53-0:22:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:22:53):**  Investors want to invest.  
**[0:22:54-0:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:22:54):**  They want to put their money to work.  
**[0:22:56-0:22:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:22:56):**  The problem is finding good projects and good deals.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:22:58):**  So as long as you can find a place for people to put their money, you won't have a problem  
**[0:23:03-0:23:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:23:03):**  raising it.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:23:04):**  So that's where our full focus was, just listening to the pain points.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:23:08):**  So how easy was it to raise it?  
**[0:23:09-0:23:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:23:09):**  No, I'm joking.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:23:10):**  But it's something that comes back very often in the book.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:23:13):**  But it's the issue, doesn't seem to be the money, the issue seems to be where to put  
**[0:23:17-0:23:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:23:17):**  it.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:23:18):**  Good places, bankable things.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:23:19):**  I mean, there's so many hoops you have to jump through and you know that very, very  
**[0:23:22-0:23:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:23:22):**  well.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:23:23):**  But it's, yeah, you raised more than you planned, basically.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:23:25):**  Yeah, I think that we did.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:23:27):**  I think that came apart too, of just, I mean, Brandon, in particular, I'm a generalist and  
**[0:23:32-0:23:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:23:32):**  Brandon's ability to focus and really dial in on a specific product that solved a very  
**[0:23:39-0:23:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:23:39):**  big need, I think really helped us.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:23:42):**  You know, you sort of want to change the whole system at once, but you can't.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:23:46):**  You've got to really think about what intervention makes the best sense for the need and the  
**[0:23:51-0:23:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:23:51):**  problem that we're sensing and hearing about, and how does that reconcile against our gifts  
**[0:23:57-0:23:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:23:57):**  and passion for the world, right?  
**[0:23:58-0:24:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:23:58):**  Because from a human perspective, I was taught early on, my mission in life is to discover  
**[0:24:03-0:24:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:24:03):**  who I am and my gifts and use them in service to humanity and the earth.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:24:08):**  Like, it's that simple.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:24:09):**  That's why I'm here.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:24:10):**  And so, how do you go about that inward journey of the self to go, where are my best poise  
**[0:24:15-0:24:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:24:15):**  to serve?  
**[0:24:17-0:24:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:24:17):**  And you know, Brandon joined Mad Ag as a carbon economist with visions of saving the world  
**[0:24:22-0:24:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:24:22):**  by inclining the change with that, but it was like, well, that's, farmers, it turns  
**[0:24:25-0:24:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:24:25):**  out actually don't really, that's like one of the last things on their list, is getting  
**[0:24:29-0:24:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:24:29):**  paid for carbon.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:24:30):**  Like, they're like, oh, that's gravy, but like, how is that going to happen?  
**[0:24:34-0:24:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:24:34):**  You know, they've got a lot of weird nefarious actors out there, don't know how to manage  
**[0:24:38-0:24:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:24:38):**  it.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:24:39):**  And so, it's like a tier three sort of importance thing, carbon payments, especially at $15  
**[0:24:45-0:24:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:24:45):**  a ton.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:24:46):**  And so, what the world ends up doing, we end up like hyper cerebral and creating all of  
**[0:24:51-0:24:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:24:51):**  these interesting solutions in our mind.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:24:53):**  And then we try to apply it to the sector of farming, and the farmer doesn't even want  
**[0:24:57-0:24:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:24:57):**  it, right?  
**[0:24:58-0:25:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:24:58):**  Like, that's kind of the carbon market thing in a nutshell, just to be really blunt.  
**[0:25:04-0:25:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:25:04):**  And no one's listening to the farmer's needs.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:25:05):**  Like, does a farmer want to make money?  
**[0:25:07-0:25:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:25:07):**  Of course.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:25:08):**  Do they need markets?  
**[0:25:09-0:25:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:25:09):**  Yes.  
**[0:25:10-0:25:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:25:10):**  Do they want to get paid for the full value of their farm?  
**[0:25:11-0:25:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:25:11):**  Yes.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:25:12):**  But that's best done in the food that people purchase.  
**[0:25:14-0:25:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:25:14):**  We undervalue food.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:25:16):**  And I don't know, I just think that empathy is everything.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:25:21):**  Empathy is everything in a relationship, a human relationship, a farmer relationship,  
**[0:25:25-0:25:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:25:25):**  in the relationship to the land.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:25:27):**  Like the earth is suffering, and we don't even know what it wants to be, right?  
**[0:25:31-0:25:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:25:31):**  Like we don't have, our empathy muscle is so underdeveloped as a human species.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:25:37):**  And that's really where it starts.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:25:39):**  And I think that's where the Perennial Fund and all of our work at Mad Ag ultimately stems  
**[0:25:43-0:25:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:25:43):**  from.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:25:44):**  And it's the most important thing.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:25:47):**  Sounds like really, really good advice.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:25:49):**  And it's interesting.  
**[0:25:51-0:25:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:25:51):**  I'm very curious.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:25:52):**  So definitely get in touch with anybody who is building something similar along those  
**[0:25:56-0:26:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:25:56):**  lines around the world, because I'm fascinated by the whole transition and not just transition  
**[0:26:01-0:26:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:26:01):**  finance, but everything that's needed for the transition, which often turns out to be  
**[0:26:05-0:26:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:26:05):**  not necessarily finance only, definitely not finance only.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:26:08):**  So anything of those four farmers or the next ones that are coming up that are particularly  
**[0:26:13-0:26:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:26:13):**  exciting stories you mentioned, you're going to actually follow them even through visual  
**[0:26:18-0:26:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:26:18):**  theories, like what's happening there?  
**[0:26:20-0:26:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:26:20):**  Why are you doing that?  
**[0:26:21-0:26:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:26:21):**  And then of course, let's talk a bit about the research project before we wrap up.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:26:25):**  Yeah, we believe that organic and regenerative agriculture creates ecological and financial  
**[0:26:30-0:26:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:26:30):**  wealth, right?  
**[0:26:31-0:26:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:26:31):**  It improves the land, improves the farmer, improves the community across the system as  
**[0:26:38-0:26:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:26:38):**  it transforms the way we live.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:26:41):**  And we feel like we need to document that, right?  
**[0:26:43-0:26:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:26:43):**  I mean, and we're to document it in two ways.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:26:46):**  And that documentation will be used for many different purposes.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:26:50):**  And the documentation is sort of broken into a more qualitative story based cultural revolution.  
**[0:26:56-0:26:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:26:56):**  We have two documentary filmmakers working on that.  
**[0:26:58-0:26:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:26:58):**  We can talk about that.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:26:59):**  And then the quantitative piece is being done with the scientific lens of transformation.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:27:06):**  We're working with Applied Ecological Services, now RES, which they've just acquired, with  
**[0:27:12-0:27:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:27:12):**  Steve Appelbaum, and then we're working with John Lundgren at Dyson Foundation to really  
**[0:27:17-0:27:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:27:17):**  fully map and monitor the financial transformation, enterprise, the balance sheet, building equity  
**[0:27:24-0:27:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:27:24):**  in the farm.  
**[0:27:25-0:27:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:27:25):**  And then in tandem, also monitoring all of the improvements to insects, to pollinators,  
**[0:27:33-0:27:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:27:33):**  to breeding birds, to soil health, to soil carbon, to soil water, to plant diversity.  
**[0:27:40-0:27:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:27:40):**  We're monitoring all of that stuff.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:27:42):**  This is a project that was funded, their lead funder SilverStrand, our anchor investor in  
**[0:27:46-0:27:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:27:46):**  the perennial fund.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:27:47):**  Fans of the show, shout out to Kelvin and the whole group.  
**[0:27:50-0:27:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:27:50):**  Yeah, we're huge fans and partners.  
**[0:27:53-0:27:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:27:53):**  And we're going to be tracking that over 10 years with some scientists who are just at  
**[0:27:59-0:28:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:27:59):**  the top of the field in terms of how to monitor and track that.  
**[0:28:02-0:28:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:28:02):**  And how are you going to make that visual?  
**[0:28:03-0:28:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:28:03):**  Like how do we, I mean, we've all seen the biggest little farm and there's amazing shots  
**[0:28:07-0:28:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:28:07):**  like every year in the same spot, etc.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:28:10):**  Very costly process, as I remember correctly.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:28:13):**  How are you going to make the insects visual?  
**[0:28:15-0:28:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:28:15):**  Basically, I would almost see the farm or the land coming to life.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:28:18):**  How is that going to happen?  
**[0:28:20-0:28:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:28:20):**  If you know already, I'm just curious from a former storytelling background.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:28:23):**  Yeah, we're just starting the storyboard.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:28:25):**  You know, Brendan and Kirk, who we're working with, are very, they've created a highly compelling  
**[0:28:31-0:28:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:28:31):**  documentary films.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:28:33):**  And we're just in the midst of figuring out how we're going to share that transformation.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:28:37):**  Most likely, it'll be really, really personal.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:28:39):**  It's going to be oriented around the farmer themselves and their journey.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:28:42):**  There's been a lot of sort of doom and gloom, big disaster films out there.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:28:48):**  And I think that's appropriate.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:28:49):**  Like we are responding to crisis.  
**[0:28:51-0:28:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:28:51):**  I mean, that's why the perennial fund exists.  
**[0:28:54-0:29:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:28:54):**  At the same time, I think there's sort of a more hopeful orientation to take that taps  
**[0:29:01-0:29:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:29:01):**  into the unique story of each individual farmer that sort of is taking courage, you know,  
**[0:29:07-0:29:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:29:07):**  and stepping out in the new ways.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:29:09):**  And so that's, I think, the sort of storytelling line that we're going to be taking.  
**[0:29:13-0:29:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:29:13):**  I'm sure it'll be full of drones and beautiful, up close pictures of birds and butterflies  
**[0:29:18-0:29:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:29:18):**  and stuff like that.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:29:19):**  But yeah, I don't know.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:29:21):**  We're thinking about it pretty hard.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:29:23):**  What's compelling, right?  
**[0:29:24-0:29:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:29:24):**  I mean, that's ultimately what we need to think about.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:29:27):**  And how do we in a time when there's actually, I think, the agricultural regen ag media space  
**[0:29:35-0:29:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:29:35):**  is actually becoming pretty full, you know, with interesting and great videos and media.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:29:41):**  What's the next sort of iteration of the story that's going to broaden the audience and sort  
**[0:29:47-0:29:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:29:47):**  of hook more people into feeling they're a part of this transformation?  
**[0:29:51-0:29:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:29:51):**  So we have four different things we're making actually in order to sort of capture different  
**[0:29:55-0:29:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:29:55):**  audiences.  
**[0:29:56-0:30:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:29:56):**  One is sort of just general lovers of land and food, you know, like, here's Mad Ag and  
**[0:30:01-0:30:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:30:01):**  what we're doing.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:30:02):**  We're also capturing really that kind of farmer's story and celebrating them to attract more  
**[0:30:09-0:30:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:30:09):**  farmers into the Perennial Fund.  
**[0:30:11-0:30:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:30:11):**  The other audience that we're targeting another product for, media product for, is brands  
**[0:30:18-0:30:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:30:18):**  and buyers so we can represent these farmers to place in a new way.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:30:23):**  And then the research project documentary will really be about sort of, we're starting  
**[0:30:29-0:30:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:30:29):**  this journey.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:30:30):**  Our belief is that regen organic ag is better for the future.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:30:33):**  Like start with us on this journey to figure out how and we're going to be tracking everything  
**[0:30:38-0:30:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:30:38):**  and we won't have much to show for it.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:30:39):**  You know, it takes time to change the soil.  
**[0:30:41-0:30:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:30:41):**  It takes time to change your relationship to place, but it happens.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:30:45):**  And you know, we're so used to thinking on an annual time scale and every which way that  
**[0:30:50-0:30:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:30:50):**  when you can start seeing evolution over three or five or seven or 10 years and you can trust  
**[0:30:56-0:31:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:30:56):**  that the thing is going to transform and break that kind of mental time barrier constraint  
**[0:31:02-0:31:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:31:02):**  on our expectation, I think it will really be powerful for society and particularly farmers  
**[0:31:08-0:31:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:31:08):**  who are investing but not going to see that return years back.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:31:14):**  And the last thing I'll say on that is that we've been on countless farms across the country  
**[0:31:19-0:31:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:31:19):**  and after you spend a field day with a farmer, it's really encouraging to me that we end  
**[0:31:25-0:31:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:31:25):**  up sort of talking shop and vision usually in like the wild places on the farm or like  
**[0:31:31-0:31:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:31:31):**  under the big oak tree, right?  
**[0:31:33-0:31:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:31:33):**  You're in the restored prairie, you're on the edge of the woodland.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:31:37):**  Where it's nicest probably.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:31:38):**  I mean, that's the nicest place to be, the freshest or the warmest or depending on where  
**[0:31:42-0:31:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:31:42):**  you are, probably you can shelter for the rain.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:31:44):**  If it rains, it's the most alive place.  
**[0:31:47-0:31:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:31:47):**  It's the most alive place.  
**[0:31:48-0:31:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:31:48):**  And there's something that's very fundamental to that that I feel like is at the core of  
**[0:31:53-0:31:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:31:53):**  what we're going to be communicating because it is, it's sort of like a human being around  
**[0:31:57-0:31:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:31:57):**  a fire.  
**[0:31:58-0:32:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:31:58):**  Like it's something primordial that we feel attached to and tethered to and that we see  
**[0:32:03-0:32:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:32:03):**  that on each and every farm that we work with.  
**[0:32:06-0:32:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:32:06):**  And so I think there's going to be an element of that too, that sort of anchoring that tethering  
**[0:32:10-0:32:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:32:10):**  into our story, our bigger story.  
**[0:32:12-0:32:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:32:12):**  So how can people help?  
**[0:32:14-0:32:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:32:14):**  What do you need from the community if you need anything at the moment?  
**[0:32:17-0:32:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:32:17):**  Maybe you're just hats down and full on in building, getting loans out of the door, getting  
**[0:32:23-0:32:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:32:23):**  documentaries made, research projects, what's missing?  
**[0:32:27-0:32:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:32:27):**  How can people help?  
**[0:32:28-0:32:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:32:28):**  Top of mind for me is money.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:32:30):**  We need philanthropic support to build our programs.  
**[0:32:33-0:32:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:32:33):**  It's growth capital.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:32:34):**  Most of our programs are going to be cash flowing within two or three years.  
**[0:32:38-0:32:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:32:38):**  So we need catalytic capital to build our teams and create runway.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:32:43):**  And I know that's really blunt, but it is totally 100% honest.  
**[0:32:48-0:32:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:32:48):**  Money is our limiting factor.  
**[0:32:51-0:32:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:32:51):**  We have dozens of farmers that want to work with us, brands, people.  
**[0:32:55-0:32:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:32:55):**  We just had 119 people apply for the market's position.  
**[0:32:59-0:33:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:32:59):**  People want to be part of this movement and we've spent so long listening, learning, identifying  
**[0:33:06-0:33:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:33:06):**  these pain points.  
**[0:33:08-0:33:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:33:08):**  And now we've created something that seems like it'll work.  
**[0:33:11-0:33:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:33:11):**  It's a system of change that's going to be useful.  
**[0:33:14-0:33:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:33:14):**  And fortunately, money is the limiting barrier.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:33:18):**  Some technology that we have to reinvent.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:33:21):**  Money is a solvable problem.  
**[0:33:23-0:33:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:33:23):**  So that's our barrier right now.  
**[0:33:24-0:33:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:33:24):**  You just started with the money.  
**[0:33:25-0:33:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:33:25):**  The world was a wash of money and that's the least thing.  
**[0:33:29-0:33:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:33:29):**  The least problem you should have.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:33:31):**  But it's always easy to say.  
**[0:33:33-0:33:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:33:33):**  Yeah, it is good.  
**[0:33:34-0:33:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:33:34):**  I mean, we have like a really awesome community of funders.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:33:37):**  I don't want to disparage that.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:33:39):**  In fact, our funding partners have been tremendous.  
**[0:33:42-0:33:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:33:42):**  And at the same time, given our aspirations to move $10 billion by 2030 and grow those  
**[0:33:47-0:33:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:33:47):**  teams.  
**[0:33:48-0:33:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:33:48):**  So 10 billion with a B, right?  
**[0:33:50-0:33:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:33:50):**  Yeah, 10 billion.  
**[0:33:51-0:33:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:33:51):**  I mean, we need to build teams out and it's just honestly what we need.  
**[0:33:56-0:34:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:33:56):**  And the other thing I want to circle back to is that Mad Ag is like, we're extremely  
**[0:34:00-0:34:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:34:00):**  open about our kind of model and framework of change.  
**[0:34:03-0:34:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:34:03):**  And, you know, I've been talking to Soil Heroes and Genome, you're in a bunch about it.  
**[0:34:08-0:34:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:34:08):**  And wherever people find resonance with our style of creating change, we're an open book  
**[0:34:13-0:34:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:34:13):**  on how we do it.  
**[0:34:14-0:34:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:34:14):**  You know, so like, you know, we don't have building curriculum, building lessons and  
**[0:34:19-0:34:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:34:19):**  building things.

**[0:38:26-0:38:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:38:26):**  We're going to look into why investing regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture

**[0:38:56-0:38:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:38:56):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:38:57-0:39:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/phil-taylor-brandon-welch#t=0:38:57):**  It's not a list of investable deals.

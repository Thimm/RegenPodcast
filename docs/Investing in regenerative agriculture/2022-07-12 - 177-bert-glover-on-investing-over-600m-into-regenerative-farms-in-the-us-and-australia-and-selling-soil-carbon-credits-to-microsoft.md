## 177 Bert Glover on investing over $600M into regenerative farms in the US and Australia and selling soil carbon credits to Microsoft  
**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?

**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:00:14):**  Finally, after three years at check-in with Bert Glover of Impact Ag Partners in Australia,  
**[0:00:19-0:00:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:00:19):**  who over the last years for investors has put over 600 million to work on farms using  
**[0:00:24-0:00:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:00:24):**  regenerative practices and implementing regenerative practices, they managed to sell some of the  
**[0:00:29-0:00:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:00:29):**  world's first soil carbon credits to Microsoft and are launching an Australian-focused fund.  
**[0:00:34-0:00:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:00:34):**  So why, with all these achievements and all this work to do in Australia, did he decide  
**[0:00:39-0:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:00:39):**  to also start operations in North America?  
**[0:00:42-0:00:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:00:42):**  What does he see happening with the soil carbon markets and where will the market of biodiversity  
**[0:00:46-0:00:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:00:46):**  credits go to?  
**[0:00:47-0:00:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:00:47):**  And I'm talking about geese in this interview, which obviously have to be ducks.  
**[0:00:51-0:00:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:00:51):**  I'm very, very sorry.  
**[0:00:53-0:00:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:00:53):**  So ducks, not geese.  
**[0:00:55-0:01:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:00:55):**  Enjoy.  
**[0:01:04-0:01:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:01:04):**  This is the Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food podcast, Investing as if the Planet  
**[0:01:09-0:01:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:01:09):**  Mattered, where we talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:01:13-0:01:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:01:13):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:01:19-0:01:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:01:19):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:23-0:01:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:01:23):**  Why my focus on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:26-0:01:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:01:26):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:29-0:01:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:01:29):**  our land and our sea, grow our food, what we eat, wear and consume.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:01:34):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:38-0:01:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:01:38):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:01:41):**  To make it easy for fans to support our work, we launched our membership community and so

**[0:02:09-0:02:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:02:09):**  Welcome to another episode today, a very special one.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:02:11):**  We have Bert Glover back on the podcast.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:02:13):**  We interviewed him twice in 2019.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:02:17):**  And that feels like a long time ago, which it is.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:02:19):**  I mean, it's three years, actually to the day three years.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:02:22):**  We released the first interview.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:02:24):**  And there's so much to catch up on.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:02:26):**  There's so much work that has been done on the ground at different continents, actually.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:02:30):**  So I'm very, very much looking forward to catching up to talk about the different technologies  
**[0:02:36-0:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:02:36):**  we discussed last interview, because I will put it in the links below as well.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:02:39):**  We did a full interview just on tech with a lot of virtual fencing, actually, which  
**[0:02:43-0:02:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:02:43):**  since then we've unpacked more and more.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:02:45):**  And so put all those links below.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:02:46):**  But first of all, welcome back, Bert.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:02:48):**  Thanks, Cohen.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:02:49):**  Thanks for having me.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:02:50):**  It's great to be back.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:02:51):**  What's happened in three years?  
**[0:02:52-0:02:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:02:52):**  I mean, we do check in every now and then.  
**[0:02:55-0:02:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:02:55):**  It's not that we didn't talk for three years, but we didn't talk on air.  
**[0:02:57-0:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:02:57):**  We didn't record it.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:02:58):**  So I'm very much looking forward.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:03:00):**  Let's do a very brief intro into Impact Act Partners for the people that didn't listen  
**[0:03:05-0:03:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:03:05):**  to the other interviews.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:03:06):**  We obviously go and listen to them, not now.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:03:08):**  I mean, stay here with us.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:03:10):**  But in a few sentences, what is Impact Act Partners?  
**[0:03:13-0:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:03:13):**  And then we're going to unpack a bit what has happened or what has changed in the last  
**[0:03:17-0:03:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:03:17):**  three years.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:03:18):**  Well, lots changed, Cohen.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:03:21):**  I mean, there's been a lot happening with pandemics and geopolitical issues.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:03:29):**  And again, it comes back to why we believe agriculture has got such an important role  
**[0:03:37-0:03:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:03:37):**  globally.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:03:38):**  In terms of climate change, there's so many pressures on food systems and the environment.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:03:46):**  We think agriculture is a great solution and can take a leading role in tackling climate  
**[0:03:52-0:03:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:03:52):**  change by building resilience towards its impacts and through decarbonizing the atmosphere  
**[0:03:59-0:04:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:03:59):**  and our economies.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:04:00):**  And so with some of the global challenges that we're facing as a society, we believe  
**[0:04:07-0:04:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:04:07):**  agriculture can play a major role in a lot of those and really impact our partners.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:04:13):**  You just don't believe that, actually.  
**[0:04:14-0:04:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:04:14):**  Yeah.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:04:15):**  I've been working on that, I think, for 10 years plus now.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:04:18):**  I think a lot of people on this podcast believe that the agriculture is a big part of the  
**[0:04:22-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:04:22):**  solution.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:04:23):**  But going from belief until putting hundreds of millions to work, because that's what you've  
**[0:04:27-0:04:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:04:27):**  done, there's quite a step in between.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:04:29):**  So where would you describe Impact Act Partners now as we're talking, what is it, May 2022?  
**[0:04:35-0:04:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:04:35):**  Depending on when you listen to this, obviously.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:04:36):**  Let's say spring in the Northern Hemisphere, 2022, where does Impact Act Partners stand?  
**[0:04:41-0:04:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:04:41):**  So we currently manage over $600M of assets under management across Australia.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:04:50):**  And we've now, as you alluded to, expanded into the US.  
**[0:04:55-0:05:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:04:55):**  There's 500,000 acres under management and it's a lot broader than what it was 3-years  
**[0:05:00-0:05:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:05:00):**  ago, Cohen.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:05:03):**  We've got permanent tree nut crops.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:05:05):**  We've got wheat, barley cropping in Western Australia.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:05:11):**  We've got ranch in the US.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:05:13):**  We've got carbon projects, renewable projects, biodiversity projects.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:05:20):**  We've done green finance deals.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:05:23):**  We've sold soil carbon.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:05:25):**  A lot's happened in 3-years.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:05:28):**  And if you think about what was in that last podcast around, I think I probably spoke to  
**[0:05:33-0:05:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:05:33):**  you about environmental finance and I spoke to you about monetizing soil carbon.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:05:37):**  We've probably done the very first of some of those for us as a firm and some of those  
**[0:05:43-0:05:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:05:43):**  were first in the world.  
**[0:05:45-0:05:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:05:45):**  So we're really proud of what we've done.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:05:48):**  We've got a lot of work to do.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:05:53):**  We haven't got all the answers.  
**[0:05:55-0:05:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:05:55):**  We're trying really hard.  
**[0:05:57-0:05:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:05:57):**  We're scaling up.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:05:59):**  We've got a fantastic team of 10 people here in Australia, plus on the ground staff that  
**[0:06:06-0:06:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:06:06):**  manage our farms who are all amazing and a team of three or four in the US.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:06:12):**  So trying to demonstrate what we do globally, Cohen, we believe some of the things we've  
**[0:06:18-0:06:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:06:18):**  learned and practiced here in Australia can have global impact and we feel like we're  
**[0:06:25-0:06:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:06:25):**  getting really prepared to try and help demonstrate the role that agriculture can play in terms  
**[0:06:32-0:06:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:06:32):**  of food security, landscape management, addressing climate change and how we manage grasslands  
**[0:06:41-0:06:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:06:41):**  and bringing more financial returns as well back to the farm gate so that farmers can  
**[0:06:48-0:06:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:06:48):**  reinvest in their farms, reinvest in their assets.  
**[0:06:51-0:07:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:06:51):**  And this helps fund things like carbon projects, like development, like improved biodiversity,  
**[0:07:00-0:07:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:07:00):**  improvement in waterways.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:07:02):**  So we're excited.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:07:05):**  As you can tell, we're scaling up.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:07:09):**  And yeah, I mean, where do you want to start?  
**[0:07:13-0:07:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:07:13):**  Let's start with how did that happen?  
**[0:07:16-0:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:07:16):**  Because how did the move, let's say, or the growth to another continent happen?  
**[0:07:21-0:07:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:07:21):**  Because Australia is very big, as many people know.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:07:24):**  There's a lot of work to be done there.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:07:26):**  You could have stayed there, not stayed there.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:07:28):**  You could have worked there for many more decades before you were, quote unquote, done  
**[0:07:33-0:07:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:07:33):**  or the regeneration is complete, which it never is.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:07:36):**  But you decided to make your life a bit more complicated, be in different time zones with  
**[0:07:41-0:07:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:07:41):**  different teams on the ground in different continents.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:07:44):**  How did that happen?  
**[0:07:45-0:07:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:07:45):**  And why did you decided to become also active in North America?  
**[0:07:50-0:07:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:07:50):**  Good question.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:07:52):**  There's three main reasons, but I think the word you used that resonates with me the most  
**[0:07:59-0:08:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:07:59):**  is why.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:08:01):**  And the reason why, it goes back to our fundamental core values as a business and what we believe  
**[0:08:08-0:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:08:08):**  in and really what we want to achieve.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:08:11):**  And for us, if we can help be a thought leader around how agriculture can play a major role  
**[0:08:20-0:08:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:08:20):**  in decarbonising the atmosphere, producing nutrient dense food and demonstrating how  
**[0:08:27-0:08:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:08:27):**  livestock have a critical role to play in landscapes and the role that external capital  
**[0:08:35-0:08:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:08:35):**  can play in catalysing that change.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:08:38):**  I felt like by going to North America and potentially going a bit broader globally,  
**[0:08:47-0:08:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:08:47):**  just maybe we can take some of our learnings and share those.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:08:51):**  Maybe we can share some of our successes and also share some of the things that haven't  
**[0:08:56-0:08:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:08:56):**  worked so well.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:08:57):**  We're quite transparent.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:09:00):**  We're very data centric, so we can show our performance with data.  
**[0:09:03-0:09:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:09:03):**  But we talk about creating a ripple effect through societies and through industries and  
**[0:09:10-0:09:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:09:10):**  hopefully have an impact on some governments about how we think we can approach the production  
**[0:09:16-0:09:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:09:16):**  of food and fibre different.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:09:18):**  And I felt like we had to get a footprint in the US.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:09:21):**  So going back to your question, one reason.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:09:25):**  So where do you start then?  
**[0:09:26-0:09:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:09:26):**  Like how do you how do you start that?  
**[0:09:29-0:09:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:09:29):**  Like feeling like you should have and it makes a lot of sense.  
**[0:09:32-0:09:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:09:32):**  I mean, things get more real if you can see and touch them as long as they're for many  
**[0:09:37-0:09:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:09:37):**  people far away in Australia.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:09:39):**  We can always say, yeah, but it works there because there's a government that supports  
**[0:09:42-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:09:42):**  something or they have different climate or soil and all of those things are not true  
**[0:09:46-0:09:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:09:46):**  and true at the same time.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:09:47):**  So to show it somewhere else, like look, we can replicate somewhere else as well is very,  
**[0:09:51-0:09:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:09:51):**  very, very strong.  
**[0:09:53-0:09:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:09:53):**  But then the step to do it and start managing large farms, because these are hundreds of  
**[0:09:58-0:10:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:09:58):**  thousands of acres, this is not let's start a market garden somewhere, which is also not  
**[0:10:03-0:10:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:10:03):**  easy.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:10:04):**  But this is this is definitely on the scale of not easiness quite high.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:10:07):**  Like, where do you start then going from what would be nice to start something in North America  
**[0:10:11-0:10:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:10:11):**  to actually buying your first property, start managing land, hiring people?  
**[0:10:15-0:10:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:10:15):**  Like, what was the first step there?  
**[0:10:17-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:10:17):**  I think the first step was getting investor confidence and investor confidence came off  
**[0:10:22-0:10:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:10:22):**  the back of the fact that we generated primarily soil carbon off assets here in Australia.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:10:29):**  We had the data to back it up.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:10:32):**  We did the deal with Microsoft selling the soil carbon credits.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:10:36):**  And I think, you know, the pandemic changed a lot about investor perception around how  
**[0:10:43-0:10:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:10:43):**  we grow food in relation to nature.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:10:46):**  Really?  
**[0:10:47-0:10:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:10:47):**  What's the biggest advantage?  
**[0:10:48-0:10:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:10:48):**  Like, what do you another advantage?  
**[0:10:50-0:10:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:10:50):**  What's the biggest surprise?  
**[0:10:51-0:10:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:10:51):**  Or how do you see that that the pandemic has changed that is that you get more phone calls,  
**[0:10:57-0:11:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:10:57):**  you get better and more interesting phone calls, you, you get more deeper conversations  
**[0:11:01-0:11:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:11:01):**  about the role of land and livestock?  
**[0:11:04-0:11:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:11:04):**  Or what do you see when you say it has changed?  
**[0:11:07-0:11:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:11:07):**  How does that manifest itself?  
**[0:11:08-0:11:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:11:08):**  I think that what the pandemic was, what the impact was that the pandemic slowed everyone  
**[0:11:14-0:11:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:11:14):**  down.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:11:16):**  And that is people that live in cities, you know, and, and let's think about the capital  
**[0:11:22-0:11:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:11:22):**  flows that come to impact ag, you know, investors sitting at home, thinking about where their  
**[0:11:29-0:11:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:11:29):**  food comes from.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:11:31):**  Thinking about if things get worse, do I have a vegetable garden?  
**[0:11:34-0:11:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:11:34):**  Where do I source my food from?  
**[0:11:36-0:11:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:11:36):**  How's it got here into my house?  
**[0:11:39-0:11:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:11:39):**  And in some cases, yeah.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:11:42):**  And in some cases, you know, people were, people were locked up because there was lockdowns  
**[0:11:46-0:11:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:11:46):**  in different parts of parts of the world.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:11:48):**  So you know, they didn't have their freedoms.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:11:51):**  They had their food, they had their family, and it was a humbling experience for many  
**[0:11:54-0:11:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:11:54):**  people.  
**[0:11:55-0:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:11:55):**  And I think what, what happened was that we started to think about, you know, how did  
**[0:12:03-0:12:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:12:03):**  the disease around, you know, COVID happen, you know, you know, humanity getting closer  
**[0:12:10-0:12:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:12:10):**  to nature.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:12:12):**  And then you, investors thinking about, well, you know, how does food production interact  
**[0:12:17-0:12:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:12:17):**  with nature?  
**[0:12:18-0:12:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:12:18):**  And what, what is the outcomes of that for nature?  
**[0:12:22-0:12:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:12:22):**  And how are we going to interact with nature moving forward?  
**[0:12:25-0:12:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:12:25):**  And on top of that, you got this whole climate change discussion and then COP26 happened  
**[0:12:31-0:12:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:12:31):**  as well.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:12:32):**  And so I think it seems like there's been a little bit of a reset.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:12:37):**  And even I've seen traveling since borders have opened up both in the, you know, US and  
**[0:12:45-0:12:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:12:45):**  here in Australia.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:12:48):**  So you got investors that got interested and more comfortable in these kinds of investments,  
**[0:12:54-0:13:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:12:54):**  and you took them basically to say, okay, let's focus on getting a foothold in North  
**[0:13:00-0:13:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:13:00):**  America.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:13:02):**  And currently, what are you managing there?  
**[0:13:04-0:13:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:13:04):**  Like in terms of, is it equal to size or what you're managing in Australia?  
**[0:13:07-0:13:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:13:07):**  Is it smaller?  
**[0:13:08-0:13:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:13:08):**  Is it bigger?  
**[0:13:09-0:13:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:13:09):**  Like what is the, or everything is bigger in the US, so it must be bigger.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:13:13):**  Like what's the current ratio, let's say Australia versus US for you.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:13:19):**  So the US, it's probably, you know, 40 or 50% of, you know, what we're doing here in  
**[0:13:30-0:13:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:13:30):**  some regard.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:13:31):**  I mean, from an area point of view, it's a large amount of area, you know, 300,000 acres  
**[0:13:38-0:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:13:38):**  in America.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:13:39):**  So that's quite a footprint.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:13:41):**  But in terms of the business and intensity, it's nowhere near as intense as some of the  
**[0:13:46-0:13:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:13:46):**  Australian businesses, and it's primarily a large cattle ranch.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:13:50):**  So you know, it's not diversified and, you know, it's not row crop.  
**[0:13:55-0:14:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:13:55):**  It's primarily beef production in a semi-arid environment, which has cold winters.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:14:02):**  So that creates some different thinking that's going to be required for us, especially with  
**[0:14:08-0:14:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:14:08):**  our focus on natural capital and soil carbon sequestration.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:14:12):**  So you know, it's going to be a good challenge for us.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:14:18):**  We're already making some good headway, but it's really exciting.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:14:22):**  And I'm hoping that we can take a lot of our learnings.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:14:26):**  Some of our specialist team have already been there.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:14:28):**  We've got some great plans.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:14:30):**  We've got some new pilots.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:14:32):**  We're already starting to roll out there, working with universities.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:14:37):**  So you know, it's a good move.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:14:40):**  It's a substantial move for us.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:14:44):**  It's large enough for it to be efficient and effective.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:14:48):**  And you know, it could be a great launching pad for us, but also a great demonstrator  
**[0:14:55-0:15:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:14:55):**  of how we can go about things to address climate change and food production.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:15:01):**  So it's exciting for us.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:15:03):**  What are the differences you see now in ranching?  
**[0:15:07-0:15:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:15:07):**  Let's say a farm or ranch you bought in Australia and the one you now bought or you're managing  
**[0:15:15-0:15:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:15:15):**  for your investors in the US.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:15:18):**  What does the implementation look like?  
**[0:15:19-0:15:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:15:19):**  What are you going to do there?  
**[0:15:21-0:15:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:15:21):**  Is it very different from what you're used to in Australia or is it relatively simple?  
**[0:15:25-0:15:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:15:25):**  Like, look, we have the guidebook, the recipe book.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:15:28):**  We perfected it over the last years.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:15:30):**  Of course, it's a different regulatory environment, et cetera.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:15:33):**  But we know step one to ten really, really like intensity goes up or we do different  
**[0:15:39-0:15:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:15:39):**  grazing systems.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:15:40):**  We need to get in front.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:15:41):**  Like, what does it look like on the ground?  
**[0:15:43-0:15:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:15:43):**  Try to describe it as visually as possible, because I think it's difficult to understand  
**[0:15:47-0:15:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:15:47):**  the sheer size and then what livestock there can do or what role it could play, which what  
**[0:15:52-0:15:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:15:52):**  you obviously have shown in Australia.  
**[0:15:55-0:16:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:15:55):**  Yeah, so I guess the first thing to say is that the core principles that we stand by,  
**[0:16:03-0:16:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:16:03):**  the practices we implement, our tactics, they're all very transferable.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:16:08):**  So we stick to those.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:16:11):**  We've got the playbook.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:16:12):**  We've got the processes and the systems.  
**[0:16:14-0:16:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:16:14):**  We can roll this out pretty much everywhere.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:16:18):**  It's just we're in different climates in the US, different landscapes, different culture,  
**[0:16:26-0:16:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:16:26):**  as you said, different regulatory environment, a lot more complex, Cohen.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:16:31):**  So environmental groups, dealing with wildlife, just different.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:16:41):**  And I think for us, dealing with different climates, so dealing with winter, dealing  
**[0:16:47-0:16:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:16:47):**  with snowpack, dealing with elevation, we're learning, but we're transferring the same  
**[0:16:56-0:16:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:16:56):**  principles and the same practices.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:16:59):**  It's just in a different environment, different climate, more stakeholders that are involved  
**[0:17:06-0:17:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:17:06):**  and have an opinion and have a say.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:17:09):**  So it's exciting and we're really up for it.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:17:14):**  I'm really excited about what we could do there.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:17:17):**  And I think too, for us, being so close to so many consumers in the US is really exciting  
**[0:17:25-0:17:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:17:25):**  for us.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:17:26):**  So one of the things that, one of the parts of the puzzle that we feel a little bit as  
**[0:17:33-0:17:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:17:33):**  pioneers in this space that we haven't cracked, we feel like we've got enough background and  
**[0:17:41-0:17:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:17:41):**  evidence now around soil carbon, biodiversity credits, renewables on farm, premiumization  
**[0:17:49-0:17:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:17:49):**  of carbon credits, these sorts of things, we feel like we've got some knowledge and  
**[0:17:54-0:17:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:17:54):**  some experience and expertise.  
**[0:17:56-0:17:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:17:56):**  And we've demonstrated that.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:17:58):**  What we probably haven't done enough of yet due to the kind of the demographics and the  
**[0:18:06-0:18:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:18:06):**  markets in Australia is that we haven't quite premiumized enough of the food and the fiber  
**[0:18:13-0:18:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:18:13):**  that we produced.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:18:14):**  So that's always been an ambition of ours to try and attract a premium for food that's  
**[0:18:23-0:18:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:18:23):**  produced in an environmentally and socially conscious way.  
**[0:18:26-0:18:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:18:26):**  And so we feel like the fact that we're all of a sudden in a country that has so many  
**[0:18:34-0:18:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:18:34):**  more, 10 times more the consumers and wealthier consumers most probably in some key cities,  
**[0:18:44-0:18:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:18:44):**  that's exciting for us because if we can bring those premiums back to the farm gate, you  
**[0:18:48-0:18:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:18:48):**  remember on our first podcast, that was my kind of golden wish.  
**[0:18:52-0:19:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:18:52):**  If I could bring more, better returns back to the farmers so they could reinvest in their  
**[0:19:00-0:19:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:19:00):**  assets that to me, that's gold.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:19:04):**  And are you planning or thinking, are you going to set up your own brand, which of course  
**[0:19:09-0:19:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:19:09):**  in the US is very competitive market, let's say, are you going to partner with some of  
**[0:19:13-0:19:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:19:13):**  the ones?  
**[0:19:14-0:19:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:19:14):**  Like, well, how do you see that happening or playing out over the next years to make  
**[0:19:19-0:19:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:19:19):**  sure that those premiums, that hard earned premiums are flowing back to the farm and  
**[0:19:24-0:19:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:19:24):**  not get lost in the commoditization of many of those markets, which you might be more  
**[0:19:30-0:19:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:19:30):**  prone to in Australia where a lot of this is going to export because it's a relatively  
**[0:19:35-0:19:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:19:35):**  small local market.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:19:36):**  And then of course, setting up supply webs and lines that are premiumized is very, very  
**[0:19:42-0:19:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:19:42):**  difficult.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:19:43):**  Now you're in a market that is relatively close, quote unquote, but it feels a lot closer.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:19:48):**  What do you see there?  
**[0:19:49-0:19:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:19:49):**  What's your role there?  
**[0:19:50-0:19:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:19:50):**  Is it going to be, which directions do you see it taking?  
**[0:19:54-0:19:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:19:54):**  Is it this big enough to set up your own brands?  
**[0:19:56-0:20:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:19:56):**  Are you going to do onsite slaughtering and processing?  
**[0:20:00-0:20:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:20:00):**  What do you feel there are next steps you want to explore?  
**[0:20:03-0:20:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:20:03):**  Obviously, imagining you haven't figured out the whole piece here yet.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:20:08):**  That's right.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:20:09):**  Haven't figured all the piece out, all the pieces of the puzzle out yet.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:20:14):**  But I mean, I can share with you what we are thinking about.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:20:17):**  And what we are thinking about is we think we've got a great story to tell.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:20:24):**  We feel like we have some elements that could make up a really great brand around carbon  
**[0:20:31-0:20:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:20:31):**  neutrality and product origination.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:20:36):**  And I feel like due to the size of the market and our target market that we will most probably  
**[0:20:43-0:20:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:20:43):**  start, and we have started, to have discussions around partnerships with people with existing  
**[0:20:50-0:20:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:20:50):**  brands, but they want that next level of brand awareness or taking a new product to brand  
**[0:20:58-0:21:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:20:58):**  that says something about carbon neutrality, environmental services, single origin, premium  
**[0:21:06-0:21:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:21:06):**  product.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:21:07):**  So we've started those conversations.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:21:10):**  And we're thinking about our production systems so that we can feed into that supply chain.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:21:15):**  And so it's very early.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:21:20):**  And in my experience, you might remember we spoke about a vertically integrated business  
**[0:21:24-0:21:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:21:24):**  we had in Australia around grass fed beef.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:21:27):**  So in my experience, we need a really robust, here's this word resilient again, resilient  
**[0:21:36-0:21:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:21:36):**  supply chain that can deliver the quality and quantity that you need to support a brand.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:21:43):**  So we will focus on the supply side probably considerably in the next one to two years,  
**[0:21:51-0:21:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:21:51):**  but we've already started the discussions around partnerships and what the product needs  
**[0:21:56-0:21:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:21:56):**  to be to create brands with those partners.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:21:59):**  So yeah, that's kind of our strategy so far, but we're only six months into the journey.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:22:09):**  And let's start to unpack a bit of the carbon side of things and the natural capital.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:22:14):**  First carbon, I mean, you were instrumental in the deal with Microsoft and we had actually  
**[0:22:20-0:22:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:22:20):**  Christian of Regen Network, I will link the interview below as well.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:22:23):**  So how did that happen?  
**[0:22:25-0:22:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:22:25):**  Probably the first soil carbon credit sold internationally or sold even in generally  
**[0:22:30-0:22:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:22:30):**  to a very high profile buyer, obviously.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:22:35):**  How did that happen?  
**[0:22:36-0:22:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:22:36):**  And then what happened since then?  
**[0:22:37-0:22:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:22:37):**  Or how do you see that?  
**[0:22:38-0:22:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:22:38):**  And we talked about biodiversity credits as well.  
**[0:22:40-0:22:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:22:40):**  Like let's start to unpack the natural capital side a bit, but let's start with the carbon  
**[0:22:45-0:22:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:22:45):**  deal, the soil carbon deal that happened I think a year and a half ago maybe or a year  
**[0:22:50-0:22:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:22:50):**  ago.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:22:51):**  I don't remember the exact details.  
**[0:22:52-0:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:22:52):**  Yeah, February, I think it was February 21.  
**[0:22:56-0:23:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:22:56):**  So yeah, a bit over 12 months.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:23:00):**  So I guess going back to the thought, and I think I explained last time about we are  
**[0:23:06-0:23:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:23:06):**  quite a data centric business and we have had since about 2010 consistent soil data  
**[0:23:15-0:23:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:23:15):**  taken in the same GPS location across some ranches using the same lab to test our soil  
**[0:23:24-0:23:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:23:24):**  all of this time and off the back of this data set and actually after meeting Christian  
**[0:23:31-0:23:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:23:31):**  in San Francisco actually where I think I saw you in 2019.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:23:36):**  So we were on a, at that point in time, we were actually on a bit of a mission to find  
**[0:23:41-0:23:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:23:41):**  the best technology to measure soil carbon, the best markets that we wanted to partner  
**[0:23:45-0:23:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:23:45):**  with to sell soil carbon and who we thought the leaders were in this emerging space.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:23:50):**  And spending time with Christian and we went and met four or five other parties whilst  
**[0:23:58-0:24:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:23:58):**  were there a colleague of mine, the head of our natural capital division.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:24:04):**  Off the back of that and with the data we had, we felt like we knew the amount of carbon  
**[0:24:11-0:24:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:24:11):**  we'd kind of sequestered.  
**[0:24:14-0:24:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:24:14):**  We knew the trend line from our ranches and so off the back of that and with satellite  
**[0:24:20-0:24:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:24:20):**  data to verify what had also happened, we were able to sell what you call vintage carbon.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:24:26):**  So it was carbon that was generated between 2017 and 2020.  
**[0:24:31-0:24:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:24:31):**  So it was three years of carbon.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:24:33):**  We call it vintage carbon.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:24:35):**  So it wasn't carbon that we were going to sequester in the future.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:24:38):**  It's carbon that we already had sequestered.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:24:40):**  And so that's what we worked with Christian and Toby and my team worked with Christian's  
**[0:24:46-0:24:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:24:46):**  team to help validate that and we had some third parties audit that as well and Microsoft  
**[0:24:54-0:24:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:24:54):**  had their own DD team on this.  
**[0:24:56-0:25:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:24:56):**  So it was the relationship with Christian and the Regen network and then those guys  
**[0:25:02-0:25:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:25:02):**  approached Microsoft.  
**[0:25:04-0:25:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:25:04):**  When Microsoft, you may have seen they put out expressions of interest.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:25:09):**  They chose our product.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:25:12):**  You might be aware that Microsoft have a commitment to offset emissions back to 1972 and they  
**[0:25:19-0:25:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:25:19):**  wanted a terrestrial based carbon credit solution to go in their bucket of offsets for that  
**[0:25:26-0:25:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:25:26):**  cohort and it just so happened that we were about the only one that had a chunk of carbon  
**[0:25:34-0:25:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:25:34):**  of three assets that we managed here in Australia.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:25:36):**  So that was great.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:25:38):**  We didn't sell all the credits.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:25:39):**  We sold a percentage and yeah, the deal was done and it was great.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:25:45):**  So I think your question was what's next or what's the future?  
**[0:25:50-0:25:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:25:50):**  Yeah, what happened?  
**[0:25:51-0:25:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:25:51):**  Because I'm imagining the phone started ringing since the press releases went out and what  
**[0:25:56-0:25:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:25:56):**  has happened since then?  
**[0:25:58-0:26:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:25:58):**  Let's start on the carbon side first and then we go to the rest of the natural capital stack.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:26:02):**  Yeah, so the phone did ring and it was large global emitters that are in the oil and gas  
**[0:26:09-0:26:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:26:09):**  sector trading houses that wanted to trade carbon, institutional banks, investors.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:26:16):**  We had people saying, we're flying up in the morning, we want to talk to you about some  
**[0:26:20-0:26:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:26:20):**  credits and we're saying, don't fly anywhere, don't leave home.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:26:25):**  We've got no more to sell you just right now.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:26:30):**  So since then, we have, so that was a private market deal that we did with Microsoft.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:26:39):**  Since then, we have continued to generate under the same protocol, carbon.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:26:45):**  So we can credit again under the same method with Regen Network and we most probably will  
**[0:26:51-0:26:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:26:51):**  either this year or next.  
**[0:26:53-0:26:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:26:53):**  So that's what we've been doing with carbon under that private protocol.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:26:59):**  We've also registered under the Australian government method as well.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:27:05):**  We've got, I think, three projects registered under that as well.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:27:09):**  So we've taken on that.  
**[0:27:11-0:27:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:27:11):**  We've been involved in supporting the government in helping iron out some of their initial  
**[0:27:17-0:27:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:27:17):**  issues around permanence and crown cover and what we call carbon stacking.  
**[0:27:25-0:27:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:27:25):**  So they're making legislative changes to enable more farmers to participate in the Australian  
**[0:27:30-0:27:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:27:30):**  government regulated soil carbon method because there was just a few too many barriers to  
**[0:27:36-0:27:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:27:36):**  entry and one being cost to participate, primarily the cost of the soil testing.  
**[0:27:43-0:27:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:27:43):**  So we've registered more projects and continue to sequester carbon and then we will start  
**[0:27:51-0:27:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:27:51):**  crediting when we think it's financially feasible to credit on those new projects.  
**[0:27:57-0:28:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:27:57):**  And just to mention that basically there is a regulated market in Australia on soil carbon,  
**[0:28:05-0:28:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:28:05):**  so a below ground.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:28:08):**  How has that been going in terms of, has it been interesting in terms of pricing for you?  
**[0:28:12-0:28:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:28:12):**  Like this comes out of the Australian government's pockets or because it doesn't get sold to  
**[0:28:16-0:28:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:28:16):**  Microsoft, et cetera.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:28:17):**  This is a public project basically to incentivize farmers.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:28:22):**  Has it been interesting so far?  
**[0:28:23-0:28:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:28:23):**  Have you sold anything?  
**[0:28:24-0:28:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:28:24):**  Has it been important for the returns or has it been mostly also helping to build this  
**[0:28:28-0:28:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:28:28):**  example as well, just as you mentioned before, because I think it's the only one globally  
**[0:28:34-0:28:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:28:34):**  where there is a regulated market for soil carbon that is public and not voluntary like  
**[0:28:40-0:28:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:28:40):**  you see in many other places.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:28:42):**  Yeah, so it is public and we haven't sold anything in that market as yet.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:28:48):**  And you're right, it is the government has been the market as well and they have created  
**[0:28:56-0:29:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:28:56):**  an auction and they've had a reverse auction and they've also been the regulator.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:29:00):**  So just recently they've said that they don't feel like they can be the market and the regulator,  
**[0:29:05-0:29:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:29:05):**  which is from a conflict and governance point of view, it's the right thing.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:29:11):**  So that has had an impact on the Australian government, what we call ACCU market, Australian  
**[0:29:17-0:29:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:29:17):**  Carbon Credit Unit market.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:29:19):**  It's had an impact on that.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:29:21):**  It's primarily saying we're now letting the market go private and that has had an impact  
**[0:29:26-0:29:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:29:26):**  on price.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:29:27):**  The price has come off.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:29:29):**  I think that's probably a short term change in price.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:29:34):**  I'm sure it will sort of get momentum back to where it was and maybe even excel.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:29:42):**  But that's where we're at.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:29:46):**  We're getting a lot better in Australia with the government around what we call stacking.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:29:51):**  So not only can you on one farm or one piece of land, not only can you have a soil carbon  
**[0:29:56-0:30:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:29:56):**  project, you can now also have a veg carbon project.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:30:02):**  And we're hoping that when this is finally legislated, you'll be able to also have your,  
**[0:30:07-0:30:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:30:07):**  if you want to do a cattle herd methodology or a Savannah burning methodology, you could,  
**[0:30:13-0:30:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:30:13):**  so in theory, you may be able to have one, two, maybe three different carbon projects  
**[0:30:19-0:30:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:30:19):**  on the one parcel of land.  
**[0:30:21-0:30:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:30:21):**  And that's when the returns get somewhat interesting.  
**[0:30:25-0:30:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:30:25):**  Let's talk about the returns first and then about the carbon potential, what you've been  
**[0:30:30-0:30:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:30:30):**  seeing.  
**[0:30:31-0:30:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:30:31):**  Has this been also the deal with Microsoft, which I don't think the price was released,  
**[0:30:36-0:30:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:30:36):**  but has it been significantly interesting or has it been so far like for the returns  
**[0:30:41-0:30:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:30:41):**  on like on a range level because you're managing this obviously for investors.  
**[0:30:46-0:30:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:30:46):**  I don't think any of your models or investing models are based purely on the carbon side  
**[0:30:50-0:30:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:30:50):**  or selling off credits.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:30:51):**  It's based on production.  
**[0:30:53-0:30:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:30:53):**  It's based on margins.  
**[0:30:54-0:30:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:30:54):**  It's based on markets and premium markets, as you mentioned now.  
**[0:30:58-0:31:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:30:58):**  How important has this natural capital selling been and where does it go?  
**[0:31:04-0:31:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:31:04):**  Like, is this going to be an interesting profit driver for land owners at some point or is  
**[0:31:08-0:31:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:31:08):**  it already the case maybe?  
**[0:31:10-0:31:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:31:10):**  Well, under some methods, so we have a method in the Australian government system here called  
**[0:31:16-0:31:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:31:16):**  HIR, it's human-induced revegetation, and primarily it's to stop farmers clearing land  
**[0:31:24-0:31:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:31:24):**  of woody vegetation.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:31:27):**  And under that method, the carbon market has pretty much now underpinned that whole business  
**[0:31:34-0:31:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:31:34):**  model.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:31:35):**  You know, there is funds and investors that are buying assets in Australia purely to put  
**[0:31:42-0:31:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:31:42):**  into a HIR project and the returns are purely from the carbon and those returns are very,  
**[0:31:50-0:31:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:31:50):**  you know, respected in the market.  
**[0:31:54-0:32:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:31:54):**  We haven't, we've bought some of those assets for investors, but it's not really our bread  
**[0:32:00-0:32:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:32:00):**  and butter in terms of where we want to see impact.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:32:04):**  We think soil carbon is where we can have the most impact and is best for climate.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:32:09):**  And if we're going to be nature positive, we think in the soil carbon markets is the  
**[0:32:14-0:32:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:32:14):**  place to go.  
**[0:32:15-0:32:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:32:15):**  And so back when we did the soil carbon deal, we're seeing annual cash yield, you know,  
**[0:32:21-0:32:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:32:21):**  upticks of say 40 basis points and in some, of some farms up to 100 basis points.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:32:27):**  So on an annual cash yield basis.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:32:30):**  And that's at a price that's, you know, in the, in the teens, let's call it.  
**[0:32:35-0:32:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:32:35):**  We're now talking about prices that are in the mid to high twenties.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:32:39):**  So maybe, you know, you start getting 50, 60 basis points on an annual basis just from  
**[0:32:46-0:32:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:32:46):**  one carbon project, a soil carbon project.  
**[0:32:50-0:32:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:32:50):**  So it's starting to be more significant depending where you are.  
**[0:32:54-0:33:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:32:54):**  And if the price continues to rise you know, if we follow Europe as an example, I think  
**[0:33:01-0:33:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:33:01):**  we're at a hundred per, yeah, a hundred euros, I think.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:33:05):**  I think you're a hundred euros.  
**[0:33:07-0:33:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:33:07):**  So that becomes substantial.  
**[0:33:11-0:33:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:33:11):**  And don't forget the, one of the key core drivers here is to improve soil health.  
**[0:33:15-0:33:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:33:15):**  So whilst you, you might be monetizing excess carbon once you've offsetted your emissions,  
**[0:33:22-0:33:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:33:22):**  but your asset base is becoming more resilient at the same time.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:33:26):**  You're storing more water, your soil is healthier, your plants should be healthier and you should  
**[0:33:32-0:33:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:33:32):**  be producing healthier food.  
**[0:33:34-0:33:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:33:34):**  So it's, it's becoming significant.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:33:39):**  It's still complexed.  
**[0:33:42-0:33:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:33:42):**  You need specialists to help you with it.  
**[0:33:45-0:33:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:33:45):**  We're building out our team, doing more in this space, but it's exciting for farmers  
**[0:33:50-0:33:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:33:50):**  that are doing the right thing.  
**[0:33:52-0:33:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:33:52):**  Is there one of the reasons you're also wanting to be closer to consumers in this case, actually  
**[0:33:58-0:34:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:33:58):**  consumers of carbon, soil carbon credits and other credits like being in the US, putting  
**[0:34:05-0:34:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:34:05):**  you closer to the Microsoft of this world?  
**[0:34:08-0:34:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:34:08):**  Is that, was that a strategic move also there to see, okay, can we get closer to a voluntary  
**[0:34:14-0:34:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:34:14):**  market where the market is potentially willing to pay?  
**[0:34:17-0:34:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:34:17):**  I mean, we have the stripes of this world that are doing a lot of experimental work  
**[0:34:20-0:34:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:34:20):**  and paying significant prices per ton.  
**[0:34:23-0:34:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:34:23):**  I put the interview with Jim Mann, I think on enhanced rock weathering and biochar, they  
**[0:34:28-0:34:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:34:28):**  are at 50 or 100 and 200 per ton.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:34:32):**  Like, was that the reason to go to the US as well and be closer to that market, not  
**[0:34:36-0:34:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:34:36):**  just the market of the produce and the products you produce?  
**[0:34:39-0:34:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:34:39):**  Yeah, for sure.  
**[0:34:40-0:34:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:34:40):**  So we're always challenging ourselves around, can we solve someone's problem?  
**[0:34:46-0:34:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:34:46):**  And I think for some large corporates in the private sector in the US, we can solve their  
**[0:34:53-0:34:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:34:53):**  carbon challenges or more so their emissions problems.  
**[0:34:58-0:35:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:34:58):**  And I feel like there is an opportunity for a firm like us to partner with some big corporations  
**[0:35:06-0:35:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:35:06):**  and deliver ongoing carbon credits to offset some of their emissions.  
**[0:35:12-0:35:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:35:12):**  And I think it may underpin and or enable us to raise capital off long term commitments  
**[0:35:20-0:35:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:35:20):**  with some of those partners in the US.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:35:22):**  So we'll be talking to more of those partners around solving some of their problems through  
**[0:35:29-0:35:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:35:29):**  a nature based solution and being nature positive.  
**[0:35:32-0:35:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:35:32):**  So I hope I answered your question, but the answer is yes.  
**[0:35:37-0:35:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:35:37):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:35:38-0:35:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:35:38):**  And then to switch a bit to the carbon potential from all the different crops you mentioned,  
**[0:35:44-0:35:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:35:44):**  the different soil types, etc. and all the measurements you do, where do you see the  
**[0:35:49-0:35:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:35:49):**  largest carbon potential?  
**[0:35:51-0:35:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:35:51):**  Because of course, if you go and talk to Microsoft or to others, and they would say, okay, what  
**[0:35:54-0:35:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:35:54):**  do we need to do?  
**[0:35:56-0:35:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:35:56):**  Of course, we need to produce the food.  
**[0:35:57-0:36:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:35:57):**  But what what systems do we need to put in place, depending where you are, that see that  
**[0:36:01-0:36:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:36:01):**  is that the silvopasture that we see in drawdown?  
**[0:36:04-0:36:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:36:04):**  Is it regenerative grazing?  
**[0:36:06-0:36:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:36:06):**  Like, what have you seen in the field with doing all these measurements that really is  
**[0:36:11-0:36:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:36:11):**  is there something that stands out?  
**[0:36:12-0:36:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:36:12):**  And what is the potential there?  
**[0:36:13-0:36:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:36:13):**  Like, is it is it worth the hype we're having now basically on carbon?  
**[0:36:18-0:36:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:36:18):**  Or is there a bit more nuanced message that comes out of the field?  
**[0:36:23-0:36:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:36:23):**  I think if in our experience, I mean, and others will have other experiences, but in  
**[0:36:28-0:36:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:36:28):**  our experience, what excites me the most is, you know, I think the planet has some is covered  
**[0:36:34-0:36:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:36:34):**  something like 50% grasslands or 60% grasslands or savanna, right?  
**[0:36:40-0:36:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:36:40):**  So there's all these plants out there that if only we could stimulate them with livestock  
**[0:36:44-0:36:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:36:44):**  more, we could sequester more carbon.  
**[0:36:46-0:36:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:36:46):**  So for me, it's a no brainer.  
**[0:36:49-0:36:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:36:49):**  And that's why we're so passionate about the role that livestock play in ecosystems is  
**[0:36:53-0:37:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:36:53):**  that we think that they're the key to taking a low value product as in savanna grass, a  
**[0:37:01-0:37:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:37:01):**  lignin, high quality, high, high content lignin product and convert it into nutrient dense  
**[0:37:07-0:37:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:37:07):**  protein being beef, whilst at the same time, asking these plants to function and work and  
**[0:37:15-0:37:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:37:15):**  draw down carbon and sink that excess carbon exudate into soil.  
**[0:37:20-0:37:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:37:20):**  For us, that's, that's where the real opportunity is.  
**[0:37:24-0:37:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:37:24):**  We also, so that's kind of at a macro level.  
**[0:37:28-0:37:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:37:28):**  And that's where we've got experience and that's where we've got, you know, track records,  
**[0:37:33-0:37:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:37:33):**  so to speak.  
**[0:37:35-0:37:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:37:35):**  What we are looking at at the moment is we like some of the permanent tree crops.  
**[0:37:43-0:37:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:37:43):**  And so in Australia, as an example, we have, we're testing out macadamias because they're  
**[0:37:47-0:37:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:37:47):**  a native tree.  
**[0:37:49-0:37:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:37:49):**  They do on a per hectare basis or per acre basis sequester and store in their biomass  
**[0:37:57-0:37:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:37:57):**  a large amount of carbon as well.  
**[0:37:59-0:38:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:37:59):**  So there is some specific plant species that we like to focus on from a carbon point of  
**[0:38:04-0:38:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:38:04):**  view.  
**[0:38:05-0:38:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:38:05):**  But, you know, again, all of these models are going to stack up financially for investors  
**[0:38:10-0:38:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:38:10):**  and we have to demonstrate good financial returns.  
**[0:38:14-0:38:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:38:14):**  So in that sort of lens, we we're open to other opportunities because we are looking  
**[0:38:19-0:38:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:38:19):**  to diversify and, and I guess manage our carbon risk, our generation risk as well.  
**[0:38:25-0:38:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:38:25):**  And do you see a role, I mean, this sounds like different properties, but a role of integration  
**[0:38:31-0:38:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:38:31):**  there as well between the going towards a more silver pasture system, like an integration  
**[0:38:37-0:38:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:38:37):**  of trees in agriculture and livestock operations?  
**[0:38:41-0:38:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:38:41):**  Have you done that or do you see it or is that too complex still to do that on the scales  
**[0:38:47-0:38:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:38:47):**  you operate?  
**[0:38:48-0:38:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:38:48):**  I think so when it comes to the integration for us, I look at the...  
**[0:38:56-0:39:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:38:56):**  Does it help the tree to grow better, faster, like if the grass around is managed by animals,  
**[0:39:01-0:39:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:39:01):**  like is there, I mean, there's, there's a lot of research obviously on that, mostly  
**[0:39:04-0:39:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:39:04):**  on smaller scale.  
**[0:39:05-0:39:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:39:05):**  I'm getting for sure emails now, but like, what, what do you see that from like putting  
**[0:39:09-0:39:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:39:09):**  your financial glasses on?  
**[0:39:11-0:39:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:39:11):**  Is that something you, you would like to do and see potential in?  
**[0:39:14-0:39:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:39:14):**  Yeah, we see potential in it.  
**[0:39:16-0:39:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:39:16):**  We'd like to do it.  
**[0:39:18-0:39:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:39:18):**  We think it stacks up from an environmental point of view and I think from an efficiency  
**[0:39:21-0:39:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:39:21):**  point of view, it just, to us it makes sense.  
**[0:39:24-0:39:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:39:24):**  So in these intensive tree crops, I think the, I think the integration for me of choice  
**[0:39:30-0:39:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:39:30):**  is birds and we haven't quite worked out.  
**[0:39:35-0:39:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:39:35):**  I didn't expect that sound like, okay, birds.  
**[0:39:38-0:39:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:39:38):**  So you mean as in poultry and I think I was like, what is he going to say?  
**[0:39:41-0:39:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:39:41):**  Birds, I mean, some birds coming in, like what are you planning there, Bert?  
**[0:39:45-0:39:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:39:45):**  Yeah.  
**[0:39:46-0:39:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:39:46):**  It's, it's, it's poultry.  
**[0:39:48-0:39:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:39:48):**  It might be, yeah, it might be chickens for meat or eggs or may or turkeys or something  
**[0:39:56-0:39:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:39:56):**  along those lines.  
**[0:39:57-0:40:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:39:57):**  But I think, you know, large, large animals or even, even pigs and sheep, my team are  
**[0:40:06-0:40:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:40:06):**  telling me it's getting more and more complex to have them in the system.  
**[0:40:10-0:40:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:40:10):**  Could be wrong, but just with the way we harvest and the things we do in those intensive tree  
**[0:40:15-0:40:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:40:15):**  environments I think birds may be the, maybe they go there.  
**[0:40:20-0:40:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:40:20):**  And so we're interested in exploring that.  
**[0:40:23-0:40:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:40:23):**  So yeah, I think financially it'll make some sense because what we mainly find if wherever  
**[0:40:29-0:40:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:40:29):**  we bring in an animal to, to, into an existing system and use them as a tool, it makes us  
**[0:40:36-0:40:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:40:36):**  more efficient.  
**[0:40:37-0:40:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:40:37):**  It brings down our cost and it produces a cleaner product.  
**[0:40:41-0:40:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:40:41):**  So we're all for that.  
**[0:40:44-0:40:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:40:44):**  I've heard very interesting things on geese actually, because I think it's the only one  
**[0:40:48-0:40:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:40:48):**  that fully can be fully raised on pasture.  
**[0:40:51-0:40:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:40:51):**  It doesn't need outside, doesn't need grain, et cetera, like many poultry need.  
**[0:40:56-0:41:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:40:56):**  And shout out to, I think it's one of the only organic geese egg producers in the UK  
**[0:41:01-0:41:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:41:01):**  that reached out recently.  
**[0:41:02-0:41:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:41:02):**  Anyway, I learned a lot on the video they shared.  
**[0:41:04-0:41:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:41:04):**  So thank you for, I hope they're listening to this one as well, but there's, there's  
**[0:41:07-0:41:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:41:07):**  very interesting roles for, for animals in, on the farm.  
**[0:41:12-0:41:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:41:12):**  And then let's tackle a big one.  
**[0:41:14-0:41:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:41:14):**  What do you say when people say, of course the livestock can, or not of course, let's  
**[0:41:18-0:41:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:41:18):**  say livestock can store X amount of carbon.  
**[0:41:21-0:41:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:41:21):**  What about the methane?  
**[0:41:22-0:41:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:41:22):**  What is your natural response?  
**[0:41:24-0:41:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:41:24):**  You must get this question all the time.  
**[0:41:26-0:41:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:41:26):**  We let's say, especially ruminants get a very bad rep, especially the cow even worse.  
**[0:41:34-0:41:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:41:34):**  What do you say when people bring up the methane elephant in the room, let's say.  
**[0:41:39-0:41:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:41:39):**  Yeah, it's a good one.  
**[0:41:40-0:41:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:41:40):**  And it's an interesting one because I guess, and that's a little bit why we have focused  
**[0:41:47-0:41:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:41:47):**  on sequestration as opposed to emissions up until now.  
**[0:41:50-0:41:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:41:50):**  Now I say that living in Australia, if I was in Europe, I would be saying something different  
**[0:41:55-0:41:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:41:55):**  because I think it's, it's my understanding that the focus is a lot more on emissions  
**[0:41:59-0:42:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:41:59):**  as opposed to sequestration.  
**[0:42:01-0:42:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:42:01):**  But that's my personal view that I don't have a lot of data to back that up.  
**[0:42:06-0:42:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:42:06):**  So to answer your question, I think for us, we like to think that we can sequester more  
**[0:42:12-0:42:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:42:12):**  than what we're, what we're emitting and we do that.  
**[0:42:14-0:42:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:42:14):**  You'll be in net positive.  
**[0:42:16-0:42:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:42:16):**  Yeah.  
**[0:42:17-0:42:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:42:17):**  And you do that through life cycle assessment and we wouldn't have carbon credits to sell  
**[0:42:21-0:42:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:42:21):**  if we didn't do that.  
**[0:42:23-0:42:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:42:23):**  And if we couldn't, if we didn't produce more than we emitted.  
**[0:42:28-0:42:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:42:28):**  I think there's definitely an interesting piece of industry work and experimentation  
**[0:42:37-0:42:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:42:37):**  to come out of what we're doing around asparagus and seaweed in the beef sector.  
**[0:42:43-0:42:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:42:43):**  We're actually, not only is it happening in Australia, but we're actually doing something  
**[0:42:47-0:42:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:42:47):**  with UC Davis out of California on the ranches we have in the US around feeding seaweed in  
**[0:42:55-0:42:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:42:55):**  a grass fed system.  
**[0:42:57-0:43:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:42:57):**  So not just in a, in a feed yard, we're doing that as well, but we're doing one in a, in  
**[0:43:02-0:43:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:43:02):**  a grass fed system as well to see what the emissions is in that environment.  
**[0:43:08-0:43:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:43:08):**  And can we raise cattle in a grass fed system with, with asparagus and what's the emissions  
**[0:43:14-0:43:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:43:14):**  reduction in that environment.  
**[0:43:16-0:43:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:43:16):**  And you know, so I think that's a real solution.  
**[0:43:19-0:43:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:43:19):**  How do you measure that?  
**[0:43:20-0:43:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:43:20):**  I guess I've seen, I think most of the research on methane has been done historically in,  
**[0:43:28-0:43:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:43:28):**  in closed environments, so the CAFO operations.  
**[0:43:30-0:43:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:43:30):**  Like I've seen very little outside or grassland ones because I think it's very tricky to do.  
**[0:43:37-0:43:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:43:37):**  And that sort of leads to, to potential question of if all of this data is based on, on grain  
**[0:43:42-0:43:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:43:42):**  fat and, and soy fat cows, it might be that the methane is a lot lower if it's, it's a  
**[0:43:48-0:43:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:43:48):**  diverse grass fed system.  
**[0:43:52-0:43:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:43:52):**  But we'll never know as we don't do that actual burping research.  
**[0:43:56-0:44:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:43:56):**  And that like, could all this research on the methane and all of these bars where the  
**[0:44:00-0:44:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:44:00):**  cow is of course the worst thing of the climate we ever did be based on, of the standard of  
**[0:44:06-0:44:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:44:06):**  the industry, which is CAFO.  
**[0:44:09-0:44:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:44:09):**  But that might put the regenerative ranching ones in the wrong corner.  
**[0:44:14-0:44:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:44:14):**  Like they're, they're being accused of something that might not be even be happening because  
**[0:44:18-0:44:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:44:18):**  the cows are much healthier.  
**[0:44:19-0:44:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:44:19):**  They're not burping so much.  
**[0:44:20-0:44:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:44:20):**  There's not a lot of methane being produced.  
**[0:44:22-0:44:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:44:22):**  I think some research of Ross Konzer showed that there's a significant reduction if cows  
**[0:44:28-0:44:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:44:28):**  are healthy and cows are in a good grassland situation, cows are much healthier and you  
**[0:44:32-0:44:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:44:32):**  lose about 80% of that methane emission, which is a lot in that.  
**[0:44:36-0:44:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:44:36):**  So is that, I feel that we're not really comparing apples and apples there.  
**[0:44:40-0:44:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:44:40):**  Have you seen that as well?  
**[0:44:41-0:44:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:44:41):**  Like what's the discussion there to like in the deeper weeds as soon as you start wanting  
**[0:44:47-0:44:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:44:47):**  to sell these craters because people will ask those questions.  
**[0:44:50-0:44:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:44:50):**  Yes.  
**[0:44:51-0:44:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:44:51):**  And that's exactly why we want to do this.  
**[0:44:53-0:44:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:44:53):**  You know, there's two reasons why we really want to do this research with UC Davis.  
**[0:44:57-0:45:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:44:57):**  One is we want to see if the product works in, in the feedlot environment.  
**[0:45:03-0:45:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:45:03):**  And we do want to compare it to the grassland natural grazing system.  
**[0:45:09-0:45:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:45:09):**  So they'll both run side by side.  
**[0:45:13-0:45:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:45:13):**  Both trials will have controls and, and those animals within the trial.  
**[0:45:18-0:45:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:45:18):**  So that will be great.  
**[0:45:20-0:45:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:45:20):**  The other thing is that if you take a step back, Cohen, majority of livestock still spend  
**[0:45:27-0:45:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:45:27):**  a large majority of their time in grasslands.  
**[0:45:30-0:45:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:45:30):**  So if we don't solve the emissions problem for livestock whilst they're on grasslands,  
**[0:45:34-0:45:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:45:34):**  then we're not really solving the emissions that come out of let's face it, agriculture.  
**[0:45:38-0:45:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:45:38):**  The majority of them, you know, livestock are a big contributor to agriculture's emissions.  
**[0:45:43-0:45:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:45:43):**  So if it's true that there's a large number of livestock out in grasslands globally, then  
**[0:45:49-0:45:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:45:49):**  we have to have a solution to reduce the methane in that environment.  
**[0:45:54-0:46:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:45:54):**  So if we, if these trials are successful and you, you asked, how do you measure them?  
**[0:46:02-0:46:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:46:02):**  Well, we have this thing called a, a green feeder where when they put, when an animal  
**[0:46:06-0:46:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:46:06):**  puts their head in and, and into a feeder, the feeder has a reader for an RFID tag and  
**[0:46:15-0:46:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:46:15):**  it determines whether the animal is in the trial or part of the control group.  
**[0:46:20-0:46:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:46:20):**  And when it puts its head in, then the feeder either drops some feed that the animal likes.  
**[0:46:27-0:46:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:46:27):**  So you know, it's obviously high in energy and or salt.  
**[0:46:31-0:46:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:46:31):**  And if it's part of the trial group, it also gets asparagopsis.  
**[0:46:35-0:46:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:46:35):**  But if it's, if it's, if it's not, if it's not, it doesn't.  
**[0:46:40-0:46:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:46:40):**  The other thing that does is whilst it's in there, it measures the hydrogen, methane,  
**[0:46:46-0:46:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:46:46):**  and also the CO2 of the animal while it's in there feeding.  
**[0:46:50-0:46:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:46:50):**  So that's how we get the numbers.  
**[0:46:52-0:46:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:46:52):**  And that data is pushed up in the cloud and it can be seen in real time, all of those  
**[0:46:59-0:47:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:46:59):**  emissions out of that animal.  
**[0:47:00-0:47:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:47:00):**  So that's really interesting.  
**[0:47:03-0:47:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:47:03):**  And that's how we're going to see.  
**[0:47:04-0:47:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:47:04):**  And how do you do that in the field?  
**[0:47:05-0:47:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:47:05):**  Like how do you do that?  
**[0:47:06-0:47:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:47:06):**  If the cow like bends down to start nibbling on the grass and gets that interaction going  
**[0:47:12-0:47:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:47:12):**  with, with the roots and the soil carbon, it's being released, et cetera, et cetera,  
**[0:47:16-0:47:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:47:16):**  et cetera.  
**[0:47:17-0:47:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:47:17):**  Like how do you measure it there?  
**[0:47:18-0:47:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:47:18):**  Like how do we, because this is an inside environment, I understand because there we  
**[0:47:21-0:47:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:47:21):**  have the sensors, but out on the field when the cow is actually self-selecting whatever  
**[0:47:27-0:47:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:47:27):**  here she wants to eat, how do we then add the seaweed to that and how do we make it  
**[0:47:34-0:47:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:47:34):**  a fair comparison?  
**[0:47:35-0:47:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:47:35):**  So I don't know the answer.  
**[0:47:36-0:47:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:47:36):**  I'm just wondering, like, how do we do that?  
**[0:47:39-0:47:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:47:39):**  So just to be clear, and so I may not have explained that correctly, these feeders are  
**[0:47:44-0:47:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:47:44):**  going to be out in the pasture.  
**[0:47:46-0:47:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:47:46):**  So the animals are going to be eating grass, but they've also got access to the feeder.  
**[0:47:51-0:47:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:47:51):**  So I think it's the first time this kind of trial has been done in that environment.  
**[0:47:57-0:48:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:47:57):**  And that's what we're really interested in to seeing the outcomes of that.  
**[0:48:02-0:48:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:48:02):**  Super interesting.  
**[0:48:03-0:48:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:48:03):**  No, it's very interesting.  
**[0:48:04-0:48:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:48:04):**  The whole methane discussion, because I've yet to meet someone who's deep into, I mean,  
**[0:48:09-0:48:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:48:09):**  obviously because they're biased, but into livestock and into the potential that is really  
**[0:48:13-0:48:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:48:13):**  worried about the methane part.  
**[0:48:15-0:48:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:48:15):**  And it seems mostly people that are not connected to agriculture are very worried about it or,  
**[0:48:19-0:48:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:48:19):**  and I see now finally a bit more attention for the methane coming off.  
**[0:48:24-0:48:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:48:24):**  I mean, the flaring, et cetera, but also the methane coming off of, let's say, the fertilizer  
**[0:48:30-0:48:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:48:30):**  used in the chemical fertilizers.  
**[0:48:31-0:48:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:48:31):**  Like there's a lot of methane that's not connected to livestock and which might be a lot easier  
**[0:48:35-0:48:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:48:35):**  to solve.  
**[0:48:36-0:48:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:48:36):**  But anyway, on closing the methane part, so you're going to do some very fundamental research.  
**[0:48:42-0:48:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:48:42):**  Research that has never been done before.  
**[0:48:45-0:48:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:48:45):**  Do you see then taking it to the next levels, let's say, or the natural capital stack, what  
**[0:48:52-0:48:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:48:52):**  has been happening in water and biodiversity?  
**[0:48:55-0:48:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:48:55):**  What you've seen like the other big, maybe even bigger topics.  
**[0:48:57-0:49:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:48:57):**  Like if we run a carbon is a nice side benefit from increasing biodiversity and water storage.  
**[0:49:04-0:49:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:49:04):**  What have you seen there?  
**[0:49:06-0:49:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:49:06):**  Has the market been waking up?  
**[0:49:08-0:49:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:49:08):**  Do we see proper management?  
**[0:49:09-0:49:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:49:09):**  Have you sold something or do you see interest coming to, because it seems like biodiversity  
**[0:49:13-0:49:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:49:13):**  is getting a bit more buzz at least.  
**[0:49:16-0:49:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:49:16):**  But have you seen that too?  
**[0:49:18-0:49:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:49:18):**  Yeah, I think there's a little bit more buzz there.  
**[0:49:22-0:49:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:49:22):**  I don't think the markets have really matured greatly.  
**[0:49:26-0:49:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:49:26):**  I think measuring biodiversity has still become somewhat of a challenge.  
**[0:49:33-0:49:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:49:33):**  We have actually sold some credits off one of our farms in Australia to a large utility  
**[0:49:41-0:49:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:49:41):**  company that needed to buy some offsets.  
**[0:49:45-0:49:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:49:45):**  Those offsets, those biodiversity offsets were relatively high value because on one  
**[0:49:50-0:49:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:49:50):**  of our farms, just based on our management, our large rotational grazing, as you know,  
**[0:49:58-0:50:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:49:58):**  supports biodiversity and regeneration of plants.  
**[0:50:00-0:50:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:50:00):**  It just so happened that we regenerated a native grass species that was historically  
**[0:50:05-0:50:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:50:05):**  native to the area and had been missing from the environment for years and years.  
**[0:50:11-0:50:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:50:11):**  But under our management, this native grass came back and it increased the value of the  
**[0:50:16-0:50:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:50:16):**  biodiversity credit.  
**[0:50:18-0:50:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:50:18):**  So I think there is small pockets of biodiversity credits being sold.  
**[0:50:24-0:50:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:50:24):**  Valuing it, I think has still got some work to do.  
**[0:50:28-0:50:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:50:28):**  I mean, we've been offered off one farm here in Australia.  
**[0:50:34-0:50:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:50:34):**  The farm might be say 20,000 acres.  
**[0:50:37-0:50:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:50:37):**  We've been offered something like $40 million for the biodiversity credits off that farm  
**[0:50:41-0:50:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:50:41):**  that have been generated.  
**[0:50:45-0:50:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:50:45):**  It's one thing to have the credits and the value on them.  
**[0:50:50-0:50:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:50:50):**  It's another thing to take them to the market.  
**[0:50:52-0:50:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:50:52):**  So whether you get paid for that biodiversity value is still yet to be seen in full.  
**[0:50:59-0:51:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:50:59):**  We've seen it in and we've been paid for in isolated cases.  
**[0:51:03-0:51:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:51:03):**  But for big chunks of biodiversity credits, we haven't done a big deal with that yet.  
**[0:51:11-0:51:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:51:11):**  And not to say that that won't happen, but I'm interested to see if the market does meet  
**[0:51:19-0:51:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:51:19):**  us where it is in theory valued at.  
**[0:51:25-0:51:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:51:25):**  And do you see it as almost more important than carbon?  
**[0:51:28-0:51:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:51:28):**  Do you see this equal?  
**[0:51:30-0:51:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:51:30):**  Or could it be because this whole carbon focus, like very single minded focus on carbon seems  
**[0:51:35-0:51:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:51:35):**  a bit off.  
**[0:51:36-0:51:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:51:36):**  If you look at a landscape, you look at a farm, if you look at it holistically, like  
**[0:51:43-0:51:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:51:43):**  what is yours?  
**[0:51:44-0:51:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:51:44):**  Or because it seems easier to measure, which maybe it isn't even, but the carbon piece  
**[0:51:47-0:51:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:51:47):**  have been hyped so much in a sense, we have to fight carbon and climate change.  
**[0:51:51-0:51:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:51:51):**  So we have to, carbon is the enemy, etc, etc.  
**[0:51:55-0:52:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:51:55):**  What do you like, what is missing on the framing almost of biodiversity to get it to the same  
**[0:52:00-0:52:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:52:00):**  level of attention?  
**[0:52:01-0:52:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:52:01):**  Because we lost 60-70% of insect cover, we lost, I don't know how many plants, most of  
**[0:52:06-0:52:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:52:06):**  them not even named.  
**[0:52:07-0:52:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:52:07):**  That seems to be almost the real crisis we're not really willing to face.  
**[0:52:14-0:52:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:52:14):**  Well, it's really interesting, isn't it?  
**[0:52:17-0:52:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:52:17):**  Because there's been all this, as you say, hype about carbon, and it's linked to climate  
**[0:52:22-0:52:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:52:22):**  change and global warming.  
**[0:52:24-0:52:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:52:24):**  It just so happens that the big industries, the big companies globally, governments have  
**[0:52:32-0:52:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:52:32):**  realized that they're going to have to reduce emissions so that by carbon offsets, that  
**[0:52:37-0:52:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:52:37):**  creates a market and to your point, all the hype.  
**[0:52:40-0:52:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:52:40):**  But it's a really good question you ask, what about biodiversity?  
**[0:52:45-0:52:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:52:45):**  And as you say, we have lost a lot.  
**[0:52:49-0:52:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:52:49):**  It's so important in our systems, right?  
**[0:52:51-0:52:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:52:51):**  It's so important in our landscapes, the role it plays.  
**[0:52:56-0:53:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:52:56):**  And it's so important if you're in the business of producing food.  
**[0:53:00-0:53:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:53:00):**  Because that one grass type that you mentioned could be fundamental for the health of that  
**[0:53:07-0:53:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:53:07):**  cow and the grazing system that was there.  
**[0:53:09-0:53:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:53:09):**  I mean, there are so many things we don't know in terms of interactions and more diverse  
**[0:53:13-0:53:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:53:13):**  and more complex, unfortunately, I mean, for your team, but more complex and more diverse  
**[0:53:17-0:53:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:53:17):**  in many cases is more resilient, like you mentioned at the beginning.  
**[0:53:21-0:53:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:53:21):**  We might uncover things and interactions that we had no clue about.  
**[0:53:27-0:53:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:53:27):**  And we only can find out if they're still there.  
**[0:53:28-0:53:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:53:28):**  And there might be some seeds hidden somewhere.  
**[0:53:30-0:53:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:53:30):**  But until the right management practice is applied, they won't come up because they need  
**[0:53:34-0:53:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:53:34):**  certain things that we maybe the elder still remember, but we don't.  
**[0:53:38-0:53:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:53:38):**  That's so true.  
**[0:53:39-0:53:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:53:39):**  And, you know, the key in our business, in our extensive agricultural production systems,  
**[0:53:46-0:53:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:53:46):**  in our suite of assets, plants are just the key for us.  
**[0:53:51-0:53:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:53:51):**  Like without a diverse set of plants in our systems, we don't have soil health.  
**[0:53:57-0:54:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:53:57):**  Without these biodiverse, healthy plants, we don't have healthy animals.  
**[0:54:01-0:54:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:54:01):**  I mean, we can't produce, you know, healthy crops without our plants and soils being 100%  
**[0:54:09-0:54:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:54:09):**  healthy.  
**[0:54:10-0:54:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:54:10):**  So we need all this stuff.  
**[0:54:11-0:54:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:54:11):**  We need biodiversity in our systems.  
**[0:54:14-0:54:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:54:14):**  And so, you know, we talk about it all the time, you know, in our team, you know, plants  
**[0:54:20-0:54:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:54:20):**  are the key to this.  
**[0:54:21-0:54:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:54:21):**  And so I don't have all the answers around biodiversity.  
**[0:54:26-0:54:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:54:26):**  I just know that we've got to measure it, manage it and try and enhance it.  
**[0:54:33-0:54:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:54:33):**  And so we, you know, we're working on this.  
**[0:54:36-0:54:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:54:36):**  Measuring it is not easy, but you've got to start somewhere.  
**[0:54:40-0:54:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:54:40):**  We work with a lot of third parties and ecologists to help us get this done, but it's so important.  
**[0:54:46-0:54:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:54:46):**  And I think everyone's got a role to play in improving biodiversity.  
**[0:54:52-0:54:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:54:52):**  And yeah, we will be hopefully paying a bit more attention on the podcast as well on this.  
**[0:54:59-0:55:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:54:59):**  And then I know you have some exciting news of that's why you're in a motel in Sydney  
**[0:55:04-0:55:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:55:04):**  to actually focus.  
**[0:55:05-0:55:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:55:05):**  Not only, I mean, it doesn't mean like this, a lot of this conversation was on North America,  
**[0:55:09-0:55:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:55:09):**  but it doesn't mean that you're no longer working in Australia, actually doing some  
**[0:55:13-0:55:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:55:13):**  very exciting work on a domestic fund in Australia.  
**[0:55:17-0:55:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:55:17):**  Can you share a bit more about it?  
**[0:55:19-0:55:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:55:19):**  I think it's early, but what triggered that instead of going from managed accounts for  
**[0:55:25-0:55:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:55:25):**  investors and mostly outside investors that want to invest in Australia to raising the  
**[0:55:30-0:55:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:55:30):**  money upfront, building a fund and then deploying it, what triggered that transition?  
**[0:55:35-0:55:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:55:35):**  Because it's a big transition as a team as well.  
**[0:55:37-0:55:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:55:37):**  Yeah, so I guess the first thing to say is it's just offering another, for us offering  
**[0:55:44-0:55:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:55:44):**  another product because through separate managed accounts that attracts a certain investor  
**[0:55:51-0:55:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:55:51):**  profile.  
**[0:55:52-0:55:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:55:52):**  But what it also does is it excludes other investors from the asset class and from our  
**[0:55:57-0:56:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:55:57):**  management and the outcomes that come from our management and those returns, both financial  
**[0:56:03-0:56:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:56:03):**  and environmental returns.  
**[0:56:05-0:56:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:56:05):**  So we wanted to open up a product to a larger segment of the market so that more investors  
**[0:56:13-0:56:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:56:13):**  could invest with us.  
**[0:56:16-0:56:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:56:16):**  Just from an efficiency and a return profile point of view, in Australian dollars, we couldn't  
**[0:56:22-0:56:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:56:22):**  really take in capital under say $10 million in a separate managed account.  
**[0:56:26-0:56:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:56:26):**  So what this is doing is...  
**[0:56:28-0:56:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:56:28):**  That reduces the market a bit.  
**[0:56:30-0:56:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:56:30):**  It does.  
**[0:56:31-0:56:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:56:31):**  So therefore by offering this new product to the market, which is a natural capital  
**[0:56:38-0:56:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:56:38):**  and real asset fund, it will just open it up to more and more investors and investors  
**[0:56:46-0:56:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:56:46):**  that want to have some exposure to the asset class but probably haven't had the capacity  
**[0:56:51-0:56:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:56:51):**  to go on their own in a separate managed account.  
**[0:56:53-0:57:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:56:53):**  So this fund will focus, as I said, on real assets in agriculture.  
**[0:57:00-0:57:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:57:00):**  We've got some future ambitions to bring in other things such as venture capital around  
**[0:57:07-0:57:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:57:07):**  ag tech and climate tech and also...  
**[0:57:11-0:57:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:57:11):**  You talked about that before.  
**[0:57:12-0:57:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:57:12):**  Yeah.  
**[0:57:13-0:57:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:57:13):**  Yeah.  
**[0:57:14-0:57:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:57:14):**  And emissions reduction and even some financing options.  
**[0:57:17-0:57:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:57:17):**  I think we spoke about green finance and environmental finance.  
**[0:57:20-0:57:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:57:20):**  So that's in say years two, three, whatever, but first and foremost, real assets and carbon.  
**[0:57:28-0:57:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:57:28):**  And within that portfolio, there will be very succinct strategies there and some tactics  
**[0:57:34-0:57:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:57:34):**  in investing in real assets that operate livestock and carbon and others that do cropping livestock  
**[0:57:44-0:57:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:57:44):**  and carbon and then permanent tree crops and timber.  
**[0:57:49-0:57:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:57:49):**  So three real pillars to the real asset initiative to start with.  
**[0:57:53-0:58:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:57:53):**  And that's all about managing risk, driving financial returns and I guess giving us some  
**[0:58:00-0:58:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:58:00):**  levers and tools to pull that will reduce our costs but hopefully result in better outcomes  
**[0:58:07-0:58:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:58:07):**  and good carbon returns along the way, along with biodiversity and good financial returns.  
**[0:58:16-0:58:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:58:16):**  So that's the plan.  
**[0:58:18-0:58:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:58:18):**  And what are your targets?  
**[0:58:20-0:58:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:58:20):**  When would you like to...  
**[0:58:22-0:58:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:58:22):**  What terms of size are you considering and when are you thinking of first close or something  
**[0:58:29-0:58:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:58:29):**  like that?  
**[0:58:30-0:58:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:58:30):**  So yeah, I think first close would be in the next three to six months.  
**[0:58:37-0:58:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:58:37):**  I mean, that's yet to really be defined.  
**[0:58:40-0:58:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:58:40):**  And the first close, we would like to have a hundred million dollars raised by the end  
**[0:58:46-0:58:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:58:46):**  of this calendar year here in Australia.  
**[0:58:48-0:58:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:58:48):**  The longer term plan is to have $500 million under management in this fund.  
**[0:58:54-0:58:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:58:54):**  And that would again bring in probably the venture capital and the finance piece.  
**[0:58:59-0:59:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:58:59):**  In the short term though, we'll try and...  
**[0:59:03-0:59:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:59:03):**  First bite would be a $50 million investment to get out and get that deployed, start getting  
**[0:59:11-0:59:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:59:11):**  action on the ground, start baselining for carbon, getting the right people on the ground,  
**[0:59:16-0:59:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:59:16):**  getting the strategy deployed.  
**[0:59:17-0:59:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:59:17):**  So that's step one.  
**[0:59:21-0:59:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:59:21):**  I think it's a perfect end of this check-in.  
**[0:59:24-0:59:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:59:24):**  I want to thank you so much for your time this morning.  
**[0:59:28-0:59:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:59:28):**  Let's make sure it's not going to be another three years before we check in again.  
**[0:59:32-0:59:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:59:32):**  And to be able to follow...  
**[0:59:34-0:59:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=0:59:34):**  And thank you for sharing and allowing us as the podcast to follow your journey as it

**[1:02:41-1:02:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=1:02:41):**  so you don't have to ride along.  
**[1:02:43-1:02:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=1:02:43):**  We're gonna look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[1:02:48-1:02:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=1:02:48):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[1:02:54-1:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=1:02:54):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[1:02:58-1:03:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=1:02:58):**  if you're a soil builder.  
**[1:03:00-1:03:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=1:03:00):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what

**[1:03:13-1:03:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=1:03:13):**  So what is it not?  
**[1:03:15-1:03:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=1:03:15):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[1:03:16-1:03:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=1:03:16):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[1:03:19-1:03:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=1:03:19):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[1:03:23-1:03:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=1:03:23):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[1:03:25-1:03:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/bert-glover-3#t=1:03:25):**  Before making any investment please find professional investment advice.

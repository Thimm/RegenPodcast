**[0:00:09-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:00:09):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture investing as if the planet mattered  
**[0:00:14-0:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:00:14):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:19-0:00:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:00:19):**  To learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil people local communities and ecosystems  
**[0:00:26-0:00:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:00:26):**  while making an appropriate and fair return  
**[0:00:28-0:00:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:00:28):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration because so many of the pressing issues we face today  
**[0:00:33-0:00:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:00:33):**  have their roots in how we treat our land grow our food and what we eat and it's time that we as investors  
**[0:00:39-0:00:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:00:39):**  big and small and consumers start paying much more attention to the dirt soil underneath our feet  
**[0:00:46-0:00:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:00:46):**  Before we get started I've been recording these interviews next to my day job and I will definitely  
**[0:00:51-0:00:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:00:51):**  continue to do so and release about an episode a month but at the same time I would love to take  
**[0:00:56-0:01:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:00:56):**  this further share more interviews there are many more stories to share on investing in regenerative  
**[0:01:01-0:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:01:01):**  food and agriculture more depth improve the quality maybe even doing some video series  
**[0:01:07-0:01:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:01:07):**  So I started a patreon community which makes it easy to support creators like myself if these

**[0:01:28-0:01:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:01:28):**  Welcome to a new episode I'm Koon Vassaian your host and today I interview Paul Chatterton  
**[0:01:34-0:01:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:01:34):**  founder of the landscape finance lab experimental unit inside the World Wildlife Fund they incubate  
**[0:01:39-0:01:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:01:39):**  sustainable landscapes and structure launch and fund deals at landscape scale  
**[0:01:44-0:01:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:01:44):**  The landscape finance lab was set up three years ago in WWF we've been successful at winning many battles but  
**[0:01:56-0:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:01:56):**  you know that that war is absolutely being lost there are half as many animals on this planet now  
**[0:02:04-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:02:04):**  in the wild as there were when I was born 50 years ago it's a disaster and the tools we have at the  
**[0:02:12-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:02:12):**  moment are not up to the challenge we need to change the whole way that we're working if we're  
**[0:02:20-0:02:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:02:20):**  going to to save nature and we need to shift whole economies to being green and supporting  
**[0:02:29-0:02:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:02:29):**  sustainability how do we do programs to save nature and promote green economy at the scale  
**[0:02:38-0:02:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:02:38):**  of a million hectares 100 million dollars investment dealing with a with with a million tons  
**[0:02:46-0:02:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:02:46):**  of traded goods a million people we've got to be able to operate at that scale as a nature  
**[0:02:52-0:02:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:02:52):**  conservation organization if we're going to save nature but the planet needs that as well if we're  
**[0:02:57-0:03:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:02:57):**  going to to reach the SDGs the global goals that's actually the real beauty of the landscape approach  
**[0:03:05-0:03:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:03:05):**  you know the when you're looking when you're dealing with with small issues you know a logging  
**[0:03:13-0:03:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:03:13):**  operation or a farm and and sustainability issues then over a short time frame at a small space  
**[0:03:21-0:03:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:03:21):**  you end up with conflict you've got very little room to move between the players with a landscape  
**[0:03:27-0:03:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:03:27):**  program you can all take a breath because you can think about landscape you have to think about  
**[0:03:33-0:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:03:33):**  landscapes over at least a 10-year period ideally in generation or more you've got to think about  
**[0:03:39-0:03:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:03:39):**  them over a much larger space which then gives you all the ability to to be more creative to move  
**[0:03:47-0:03:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:03:47):**  move operations over time rather than immediately to to restore forests or or water flows or whatever  
**[0:03:56-0:04:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:03:56):**  so the important principle is that you know the landscapes have to have to build themselves the  
**[0:04:03-0:04:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:04:03):**  people in the landscapes have to already be very organized and ready to go on to the next stage  
**[0:04:09-0:04:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:04:09):**  so we we have a an online platform people fill out details just some basic details about where  
**[0:04:16-0:04:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:04:16):**  they're up to they need to show that they've got the scale if anyone can can kick off a landscape  
**[0:04:22-0:04:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:04:22):**  program the fundamental principle though is that they then have to form a multi-stakeholder  
**[0:04:28-0:04:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:04:28):**  partnership a group of people who want to solve a problem in that landscape they go through a  
**[0:04:34-0:04:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:04:34):**  process of of understanding the landscape better and the problem and each other and and then they  
**[0:04:41-0:04:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:04:41):**  develop a collaborative plan to address the problem it's quite quite simple and then we help  
**[0:04:46-0:04:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:04:46):**  them with that and with with with getting the financing for the individual activities to to  
**[0:04:53-0:05:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:04:53):**  address the problem and that might be grant financing it might be carbon financing or more  
**[0:05:00-0:05:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:05:00):**  you know more recently where we're starting to show the ability to bring in private financing  
**[0:05:06-0:05:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:05:06):**  into areas basically Fiji is is killing his own reef not only because of we're all polluting way  
**[0:05:15-0:05:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:05:15):**  too much and the temperature in the ocean and acidity is going up but also because of the  
**[0:05:19-0:05:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:05:19):**  run-offs of their farms on the islands right nutrients the the pesticides and fertilizers  
**[0:05:26-0:05:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:05:26):**  poison the reefs the silt from from housing developments the poo from the tourists the  
**[0:05:32-0:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:05:32):**  tourists come are destroying what they come to see in fact so how do we shift that around we  
**[0:05:40-0:05:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:05:40):**  we helped 15 organizations of four government departments a number of NGOs industry groups  
**[0:05:47-0:05:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:05:47):**  banks to put together a 115 million dollar call for saving the reefs of Fiji and and that involved  
**[0:05:56-0:06:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:05:56):**  shifting over to organic agriculture shifting to sustainable fisheries and restoring the  
**[0:06:05-0:06:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:06:05):**  mangrove forest and the river forests and and dealing with waste management and we're now  
**[0:06:13-0:06:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:06:13):**  developing a 30 million dollar public sector funding program with the Fijian government  
**[0:06:19-0:06:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:06:19):**  for us it's been it's been understanding how businesses work and what bankers need  
**[0:06:25-0:06:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:06:25):**  to invest in good businesses the last year has been a really dramatic learning curve for us  
**[0:06:33-0:06:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:06:33):**  listening to to bankers shadowing them understanding what they would invest in them  
**[0:06:40-0:06:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:06:40):**  and wouldn't and then working with the businesses to see from their side  
**[0:06:44-0:06:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:06:44):**  whether that sort of thing makes sense and whether they can they can deliver impact  
**[0:06:50-0:06:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:06:50):**  we're just starting we're learning learning day by day it's it's really really quite exciting  
**[0:06:55-0:07:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:06:55):**  but i think one of the one of the key lessons we learned is that you know our best friends are the  
**[0:07:02-0:07:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:07:02):**  the local banks and local financial institutions the Fiji development bank the Fiji reserve bank  
**[0:07:08-0:07:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:07:08):**  ANZ bank in Fiji they have been very very useful and supportive players we didn't realize how  
**[0:07:17-0:07:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:07:17):**  excited they'd get by this and and and how valuable it would be for them as well  
**[0:07:24-0:07:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:07:24):**  right from the first day that's our principle is landscapes first the the team on the ground  
**[0:07:30-0:07:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:07:30):**  leads it we provide the resources to the people that are in the area and we provide the resources  
**[0:07:37-0:07:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:07:37):**  to the people that are in the area and we provide some support and coaching but it's  
**[0:07:43-0:07:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:07:43):**  they make the decisions and our goal is to help them to get the resources to build this slowly  
**[0:07:49-0:07:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:07:49):**  and steadily until they've got a hundred million dollars between them to to really shift the needle  
**[0:07:55-0:08:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:07:55):**  to change change what's happening in their landscapes and i think that's a that's a big  
**[0:08:00-0:08:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:08:00):**  thing the world is run from New York and Geneva and Frankfurt the money goes out it's it's brought  
**[0:08:10-0:08:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:08:10):**  out by people from those countries who do work with locals and then the the profit and control  
**[0:08:16-0:08:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:08:16):**  goes back if we can put the finance and the control in the hands of the people in the  
**[0:08:23-0:08:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:08:23):**  landscape and they've got a they've got an incentive to look after their own their own home  
**[0:08:28-0:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:08:28):**  much more than the people on the other side of the world do well the advantage of a landscape  
**[0:08:34-0:08:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:08:34):**  approach we're finding is that it you know it it gives you all of the stakeholders you'd want to  
**[0:08:40-0:08:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:08:40):**  talk to if you're a business you don't have to do that work yourself it gives you a set of very  
**[0:08:46-0:08:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:08:46):**  clear and simple sdg targets that you can work towards and monitoring systems to to measure those  
**[0:08:53-0:08:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:08:53):**  so you don't have to do that yourself it helps with the regulatory questions that you have as  
**[0:08:59-0:09:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:08:59):**  a business in doing fish farming or or growing ginger and turmeric or whatever it might might  
**[0:09:07-0:09:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:09:07):**  be that you're growing and it gives you a bigger goal that you can contribute to  
**[0:09:13-0:09:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:09:13):**  so our theory is that if you can if you can save and sustainably manage a hundred landscapes  
**[0:09:22-0:09:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:09:22):**  if you can get them to the point where they meet the sdg goals then then you meet the sdgs on the  
**[0:09:28-0:09:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:09:28):**  planet and uh you know our costings at the moment for building a landscape program and getting  
**[0:09:33-0:09:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:09:33):**  investment is somewhere between 100 million and a billion dollars per landscape so that's more  
**[0:09:41-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:09:41):**  expensive than a fighter jet but cheaper than an aircraft carrier and there's no reason why the  
**[0:09:47-0:09:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:09:47):**  the world couldn't find find that money we have to we have to now build the machinery to actually  
**[0:09:54-0:09:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:09:54):**  deliver deliver on that vision and that's what we're doing with the landscape finance lab  
**[0:09:59-0:10:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/20/paul-chatterton/#t=0:09:59):**  and our many partners just listen to the summary of the interview for the full length interview

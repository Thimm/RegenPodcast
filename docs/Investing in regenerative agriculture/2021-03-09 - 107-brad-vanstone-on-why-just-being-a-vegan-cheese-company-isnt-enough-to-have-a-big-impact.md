## 107 Brad Vanstone on why just being a vegan cheese company isnâ€™t enough to have a big impact  
**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?

**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:00:14):**  Simply vegan isn't good enough.  
**[0:00:15-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:00:15):**  Today a topic we usually don't cover in depth.  
**[0:00:18-0:00:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:00:18):**  The world of vegan cheeses and alternative proteins.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:00:21):**  This is the story of a company that thought they were extremely sustainable by simply  
**[0:00:25-0:00:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:00:25):**  making vegan plant-based cheese.  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:00:27):**  But they found out that if they wanted to be net positive and have the biggest impact  
**[0:00:31-0:00:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:00:31):**  possible, they needed to look a lot further into their supply chain and completely change  
**[0:00:36-0:00:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:00:36):**  all their recipes.  
**[0:00:37-0:00:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:00:37):**  I really wanted to share this story as we need the plant-based community to be part  
**[0:00:41-0:00:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:00:41):**  of the regenerative transition.  
**[0:00:43-0:00:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:00:43):**  Which means we need to ask difficult questions about industrial dairy and we need to ask  
**[0:00:47-0:00:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:00:47):**  difficult questions about the ingredients and supply chains behind plant-based products.  
**[0:00:55-0:00:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:00:55):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:00:59):**  Investing as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:01:01-0:01:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:01:01):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:01:05-0:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:01:05):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:01:11-0:01:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:01:11):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:15-0:01:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:01:15):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:17-0:01:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:01:17):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:21-0:01:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:01:21):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:24-0:01:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:01:24):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:29-0:01:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:01:29):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:01:33):**  In March last year we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support  
**[0:01:37-0:01:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:01:37):**  our work and so many of you have joined as a member.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:01:40):**  We've launched different types of benefits, exclusive content, Q&A webinars with former

**[0:01:57-0:01:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:01:57):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:01:59):**  Welcome to another episode today with Brad van stone, founder of Willycroft, a plant  
**[0:02:02-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:02:02):**  based cheese for dairy cheese lovers who is going deep into regenerative agriculture and  
**[0:02:07-0:02:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:02:07):**  soil.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:02:08):**  Welcome Brad.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:02:09):**  Thank you.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:02:10):**  Thank you for having me.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:02:11):**  So to start with the personal question we always love to ask, why are you doing what  
**[0:02:15-0:02:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:02:15):**  you're doing?  
**[0:02:16-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:02:16):**  Why soil?  
**[0:02:17-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:02:17):**  Why plant based cheeses?  
**[0:02:18-0:02:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:02:18):**  So this all started when I moved to Amsterdam.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:02:21):**  I started to eat a mainly plant based diet with my partner and we found it very easy  
**[0:02:26-0:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:02:26):**  to give up meat and milk, but cheese was definitely our favorite food until that point.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:02:31):**  I think like a lot of Dutch people, we really struggled to give up cheese.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:02:36):**  And so we started to look for alternatives in the supermarket and even back then the  
**[0:02:41-0:02:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:02:41):**  alternative to meat and milk were pretty good, but the alternatives for cheese left a lot  
**[0:02:46-0:02:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:02:46):**  to be desired back then.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:02:48):**  How many years ago is this just to have an idea?  
**[0:02:51-0:02:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:02:51):**  We're talking four or five years ago.  
**[0:02:54-0:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:02:54):**  And so I started to experiment at home in my apartment and I had a basic understanding  
**[0:02:58-0:03:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:02:58):**  of how to make cheese from my grandfather.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:03:00):**  He was a dairy farmer, so I was combining similar processes and practices, but with a plant  
**[0:03:07-0:03:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:03:07):**  based ingredient base.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:03:09):**  And from there the business kind of began very artisanally.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:03:14):**  I was just going from market to market and then after about a year I realized that actually  
**[0:03:18-0:03:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:03:18):**  if I could change one thing, it was to solve the initial problem we were facing, which  
**[0:03:24-0:03:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:03:24):**  was good quality plant based cheese at retail.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:03:28):**  But the whole intention of starting this was to create something that was genuinely having  
**[0:03:33-0:03:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:03:33):**  a positive impact on the planet.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:03:36):**  And the only way in which we realized we could do that is if we could really go back to the  
**[0:03:41-0:03:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:03:41):**  core of everything and really look at the beginning and the kind of transparency behind  
**[0:03:45-0:03:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:03:45):**  our entire supply chain.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:03:47):**  I guess that's how everything came back to the soil and the base and where things were  
**[0:03:52-0:03:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:03:52):**  produced, the emissions and the cause and effect of what happens when they are produced.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:03:57):**  And so that's kind of how we came to be.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:04:00):**  I know sort of the answer, but I would love for you to share it.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:04:03):**  When did that realization came to you and the company?  
**[0:04:07-0:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:04:07):**  Because for many, I think, plant based companies, that realization still has to arrive, that  
**[0:04:12-0:04:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:04:12):**  it's important to look beyond the ingredients.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:04:13):**  It's not just important to take out the dairy and to take out something, but it's actually  
**[0:04:17-0:04:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:04:17):**  important what do you put in and is it a highly processed, how is it farmed, etc, etc.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:04:22):**  You came to that realization and decided to act on that, which I would love to hear how  
**[0:04:26-0:04:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:04:26):**  that happened and how was that moment when you realized, OK, there's a world beyond the  
**[0:04:31-0:04:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:04:31):**  ingredients.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:04:32):**  Sure, so I think quite a common misconception is that just because something's plant based,  
**[0:04:38-0:04:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:04:38):**  it's therefore better for the planet than dairy.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:04:40):**  And so once we got past that realization and realized that there was a lot more kind of  
**[0:04:46-0:04:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:04:46):**  nuances at play, that was when we started to unravel a whole sort of rabbit warren of  
**[0:04:52-0:04:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:04:52):**  information, some of which was very difficult to take because we had to really start from  
**[0:04:59-0:05:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:04:59):**  scratch and make decisions that we didn't think we were going to have to make.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:05:04):**  Like what was the most difficult one, the most difficult realization and decision?  
**[0:05:09-0:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:05:09):**  Basically just ripping out the rule book of every single recipe we ever made.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:05:12):**  So just to give a brief kind of synopsis of plant based cheese, you really have two main  
**[0:05:18-0:05:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:05:18):**  base ingredients.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:05:19):**  You have cashews or other nuts and then more processed components as a base.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:05:25):**  So the cashew based cheeses are or other nuts are using kind of traditional processes to  
**[0:05:30-0:05:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:05:30):**  create milk and then through fermentation, creating certain flavoring.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:05:35):**  But the more processed variety are really just providing a sort of I don't want to say  
**[0:05:40-0:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:05:40):**  mimic, but that sort of experience.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:05:43):**  It looks like cheese, it melts like cheese, it kind of tastes like cheese.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:05:47):**  And so we realized that actually both models, neither of them really worked from an emissions  
**[0:05:52-0:05:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:05:52):**  standpoint.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:05:53):**  And therefore, we had to find a totally different route.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:05:58):**  And this was pretty much in line with when we just released some products on the market  
**[0:06:03-0:06:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:06:03):**  and we're trying to celebrate those products.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:06:05):**  And so, yeah, you claim to be an environmentally conscious business.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:06:10):**  You think you're on a really good path.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:06:12):**  And then you get hit with the news that actually across your entire supply chain through a  
**[0:06:18-0:06:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:06:18):**  lifecycle assessment, your emissions aren't really that much better than dairy.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:06:22):**  That was definitely a tough realization, but the most important thing we've learned today,  
**[0:06:27-0:06:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:06:27):**  for sure.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:06:28):**  And what was the biggest driver of that smaller difference than you anticipated or hoped for?  
**[0:06:33-0:06:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:06:33):**  Was it the way cashew nuts or nuts in general are grown, the water, etc.?  
**[0:06:36-0:06:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:06:36):**  What was the biggest driver of that difference?  
**[0:06:39-0:06:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:06:39):**  Yeah, it was the cashews indeed.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:06:41):**  So it's the processing of them that is the real energy intensive part.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:06:46):**  So making the milk, basically.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:06:47):**  So it's actually taking the shell off, which a lot of nuts have shells and they have shells  
**[0:06:54-0:06:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:06:54):**  on the individual nut itself.  
**[0:06:56-0:07:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:06:56):**  So for every single one, you have to remove that shell.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:07:00):**  And often that process is done actually thousands of miles away.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:07:04):**  So I think two thirds of the world's cashews are grown in Africa, but actually a huge proportion  
**[0:07:11-0:07:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:07:11):**  are then processed in somewhere like Vietnam and India and then sold.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:07:16):**  It could be in the States, it could be in Europe.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:07:18):**  So the distances they're traveling, but also the energy that's being used to process them  
**[0:07:24-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:07:24):**  is very extensive.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:07:26):**  And often it's fossil fuel energy.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:07:28):**  So we actually had a partner that was processing on site.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:07:32):**  They were growing with a load of local farmers.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:07:34):**  I think they had a thousand smallholder farmers.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:07:36):**  So it was a pretty responsible partner.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:07:39):**  They were organic.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:07:40):**  They're employing 70% women.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:07:42):**  And even then we were creating a highly emitting product.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:07:46):**  So it was a real kind of red flag that even when you do have some insight into your suppliers  
**[0:07:52-0:07:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:07:52):**  and you do think you've got some good partners, you can still cause a lot more harm than you  
**[0:07:58-0:07:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:07:58):**  imagined.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:07:59):**  And so that set of a journey to find alternatives for these nuts and to find ones that are less,  
**[0:08:03-0:08:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:08:03):**  let's say emission heavy or actually even emission positive.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:08:07):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:08:08):**  So we switched on to beans and pulses.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:08:11):**  So we're making that transition this year.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:08:13):**  So by the end of this year, all of our cheese will be based on those ingredients.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:08:17):**  We spent about 18 months looking at all manner of different factors.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:08:21):**  So the main starting point is to create a milk and from there we can create a plant  
**[0:08:26-0:08:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:08:26):**  based cheese.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:08:27):**  So there are certain nutritional components we're looking at.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:08:30):**  There are certain cost components, there are certain ethical components in terms of wages  
**[0:08:36-0:08:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:08:36):**  for the farmers.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:08:37):**  And we also now are starting to look at the soil as well.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:08:40):**  So it's difficult to find entirely regenerative ingredients at this stage.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:08:46):**  We'll maybe come on to that later.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:08:48):**  But for organic, that is something which we are, we're not totally organic by any stretch  
**[0:08:54-0:09:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:08:54):**  of the imagination, but we are at least sort of 50 to 60 percent minimum upwards to a couple  
**[0:09:00-0:09:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:09:00):**  of products which are going to be organic in a couple of months time.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:09:04):**  So where possible, our philosophy is to select organic supplies.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:09:08):**  But it's such a new space, the vegan cheese world, so we're using a lot of ingredients  
**[0:09:12-0:09:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:09:12):**  that just haven't been certified at this stage.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:09:16):**  And how difficult is it then to, because a nut and a bean seem very different from the  
**[0:09:20-0:09:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:09:20):**  non-vegan cheese expert, like how different is that process now becoming and flavor wise  
**[0:09:26-0:09:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:09:26):**  and is it much more processing for you?  
**[0:09:28-0:09:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:09:28):**  How difficult is it to switch from a nut to a milk and then a cheese to a bean and a milk  
**[0:09:33-0:09:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:09:33):**  and a cheese?  
**[0:09:34-0:09:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:09:34):**  Yeah, it's a totally different recipe.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:09:36):**  So a nut are actually probably the best base ingredient to make a milk.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:09:41):**  They're high in protein and fat, quite nutrient in flavor, quite nutrient in color.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:09:46):**  So they are just a brilliant ingredient.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:09:49):**  Beans are high in protein but not high in fat.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:09:52):**  So you have to build up that fat level with other ingredients.  
**[0:09:56-0:09:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:09:56):**  They are actually a slightly better color, white beans.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:09:59):**  So that is a plus.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:10:00):**  But yeah, we had to basically just rip up the book and start afresh with the recipes.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:10:05):**  There were certain things we could cross over, but it really has been a process of starting  
**[0:10:10-0:10:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:10:10):**  again.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:10:11):**  In terms of flavor, you're getting to, because of course your customers are used to the nut  
**[0:10:16-0:10:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:10:16):**  based ones.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:10:17):**  And so is that going to be a journey or what you're expecting there?  
**[0:10:20-0:10:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:10:20):**  Well, we always look at it actually by comparing it to the dairy cheese we're replacing because  
**[0:10:26-0:10:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:10:26):**  in our eyes, whilst we think it's fantastic when someone can just switch their diet totally  
**[0:10:33-0:10:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:10:33):**  without needing this, I do think for most people it has to be a comparable product in  
**[0:10:38-0:10:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:10:38):**  taste.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:10:39):**  I think the best meat and milk replacements that are on the market are really offering  
**[0:10:45-0:10:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:10:45):**  something that is incredibly compelling when you place plant-based and dairy next to each  
**[0:10:49-0:10:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:10:49):**  other.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:10:50):**  So for us, that is the target always.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:10:53):**  It's not necessarily to compare ourselves to other plant-based cheeses, but always the  
**[0:10:57-0:11:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:10:57):**  dairy cheese that we're trying to create an alternative for.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:11:00):**  And that's, I'm just imagining or assuming that maybe the bean-based cheeses, they might  
**[0:11:07-0:11:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:11:07):**  lend themselves to make different cheeses than the nut ones.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:11:10):**  Is that the case?  
**[0:11:11-0:11:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:11:11):**  Like it naturally goes to a certain class of cheeses and the nut ones naturally like  
**[0:11:15-0:11:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:11:15):**  bend towards another.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:11:16):**  Is that the case?  
**[0:11:17-0:11:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:11:17):**  Like you're going to release different cheese varieties because of the beans, because of  
**[0:11:22-0:11:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:11:22):**  different ingredients?  
**[0:11:23-0:11:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:11:23):**  Yeah.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:11:24):**  So we, at this stage, kind of our first focus was to create the cheeses that people are  
**[0:11:29-0:11:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:11:29):**  having every day.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:11:30):**  So in the dairy cheese world, you've got mozzarella, feta, cheddar, howder, those sorts of cheeses.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:11:37):**  So those are the ones that we focused on initially.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:11:40):**  So I couldn't say how it will work for say a camembert or a more sort of aged cheese  
**[0:11:46-0:11:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:11:46):**  or more of a kind of delicacy, but certainly for the more everyday cheeses, it's proven  
**[0:11:52-0:11:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:11:52):**  to be a really fantastic base ingredient.  
**[0:11:55-0:12:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:11:55):**  And do you see this movement or your, let's say, larger scope looking beyond your ingredients,  
**[0:12:01-0:12:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:12:01):**  looking beyond the LCA at a life cycle assessment?  
**[0:12:04-0:12:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:12:04):**  Is that something that you've seen other plant-based cheeses or let's say alternative protein companies  
**[0:12:11-0:12:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:12:11):**  starting to look at or looking at as well?  
**[0:12:13-0:12:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:12:13):**  Is there somebody you could call like in this space, like, look, we're thinking about this,  
**[0:12:17-0:12:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:12:17):**  somebody that has made a few steps already or are you really lonely in the movement at  
**[0:12:21-0:12:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:12:21):**  the moment?  
**[0:12:22-0:12:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:12:22):**  We're lonely, but we're not an island.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:12:23):**  There are two companies in Europe that I know of who are really looking at this as well.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:12:29):**  The Swiss company called Neurut, they have just released an LCA, really fantastic company,  
**[0:12:36-0:12:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:12:36):**  great people.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:12:37):**  And there's another company in Germany, I can't remember the name of, who've put their  
**[0:12:42-0:12:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:12:42):**  emissions on their packaging, which I think is another really important step.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:12:46):**  So it's starting, but this is where I think we also need to see a little bit more governmental  
**[0:12:54-0:12:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:12:54):**  involvement.  
**[0:12:55-0:13:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:12:55):**  I really think a carbon tax would be a fantastic step.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:13:00):**  We only need to look at the kind of move to a sugar tax and alcohol tax and cigarette  
**[0:13:06-0:13:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:13:06):**  tax to see the improvements those have had in restricting or improving certain health  
**[0:13:12-0:13:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:13:12):**  components.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:13:13):**  And I think when we put a monetary figure on carbon, I do really think that is going  
**[0:13:19-0:13:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:13:19):**  to force the hand of supermarkets, of suppliers, of producers.  
**[0:13:25-0:13:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:13:25):**  And yeah, I see that as something that can really help to lower the emissions that the  
**[0:13:30-0:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:13:30):**  food industry has.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:13:32):**  So you've been working on the ingredients, which is an enormous job for a small team  
**[0:13:36-0:13:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:13:36):**  like yourself.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:13:37):**  So in terms of sourcing, how difficult, I mean, you've mentioned we're trying to find  
**[0:13:41-0:13:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:13:41):**  a number of ingredients organic, but beyond that, or the soil discussion has been very,  
**[0:13:46-0:13:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:13:46):**  very difficult, non-existent in many cases.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:13:49):**  What are you working on in that area to improve that?  
**[0:13:52-0:13:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:13:52):**  Like to make it easier for yourself, but also for others, obviously, to start sourcing some  
**[0:13:55-0:14:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:13:55):**  of these ingredients in a way that is a bit more holistic, looking at the full picture.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:14:01):**  And what is your, because I know you have plans there, but I can imagine as a small  
**[0:14:04-0:14:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:14:04):**  team, it's already tricky enough to change all your recipes and figure out that part.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:14:08):**  But what are you thinking on the sourcing part and what are you working on?  
**[0:14:11-0:14:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:14:11):**  Yeah, so this part is kind of split in two.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:14:13):**  So we've got some partners who are already really pushing regenerative practices, or  
**[0:14:19-0:14:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:14:19):**  at the very least, they're already organic.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:14:21):**  So they're already, you know, very much on a similar mindset.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:14:25):**  And when you say partners, you mean farmers, I'm imagining in Europe or somewhere?  
**[0:14:29-0:14:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:14:29):**  Yeah, suppliers who can kind of give us multiple ingredients and their philosophies are very  
**[0:14:36-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:14:36):**  much in line with ours, but their buying power is just so huge that the impact that they  
**[0:14:40-0:14:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:14:40):**  can have is just enormous.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:14:42):**  So we're very lucky to work with people like that.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:14:45):**  But we're also conscious of doing some more kind of actions on our end.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:14:49):**  So we've begun a transitional farming project with a couple of local farmers here in the  
**[0:14:55-0:15:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:14:55):**  Netherlands, we're teaming up with also a couple of partner organizations like Renatured  
**[0:15:01-0:15:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:15:01):**  to help run the project.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:15:03):**  And the goal is to basically grow some of our main ingredients, so the white beans on  
**[0:15:08-0:15:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:15:08):**  what is currently dairy land, to give the dairy farmers another source of income, but  
**[0:15:14-0:15:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:15:14):**  to also localize our supply chain, and to prove that plant based producers and dairy  
**[0:15:21-0:15:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:15:21):**  farmers can work together.  
**[0:15:24-0:15:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:15:24):**  So we're going to start this on a small scale.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:15:27):**  Initially we're hoping to plant this year, but at the very latest, it will be next year,  
**[0:15:31-0:15:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:15:31):**  looking at probably 10 to 20 acres initially, so very small.  
**[0:15:35-0:15:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:15:35):**  But the goal is just to get a couple of harvests in, prove that this ingredient can be grown  
**[0:15:40-0:15:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:15:40):**  here and it is already but we just want to really cement that it can.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:15:45):**  And then we want to roll this out with much more scale.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:15:49):**  And for, let's say, I'm a dairy farmer in the Netherlands, what does it mean concretely  
**[0:15:54-0:15:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:15:54):**  for me that you're working with me on a transition, except for probably planting a few acres of  
**[0:15:59-0:16:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:15:59):**  white beans, but what does it entail?  
**[0:16:01-0:16:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:16:01):**  Yeah, so I think as we do see climate change really kicking in over the next few years,  
**[0:16:06-0:16:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:16:06):**  I think we do need to look at kind of multiple income streams for our farmers.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:16:11):**  I think that will improve their resilience.  
**[0:16:14-0:16:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:16:14):**  But I do also foresee a world that does have less dairy in it.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:16:19):**  I think that the battle we're fighting is not with smallholder dairy farms, it's with  
**[0:16:23-0:16:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:16:23):**  big dairy, which has totally left a lot of farmers behind, my grandpa included.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:16:30):**  That kind of saw an end to a fair price.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:16:33):**  It saw an end to a multi-faceted farm, the care of animals.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:16:38):**  And so we want to work with those who are still farming in smallholding setups to make  
**[0:16:43-0:16:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:16:43):**  sure that they are protected because the subsidies you see for someone like in the EU, that's  
**[0:16:50-0:16:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:16:50):**  not going to these guys, that's going to the big dairy organizations.  
**[0:16:54-0:16:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:16:54):**  So yeah, I guess we're kind of reaching out a hand to those dairy farmers and saying that,  
**[0:16:59-0:17:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:16:59):**  yeah, we respect the role that you play and we want you to be as big a part of the future  
**[0:17:05-0:17:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:17:05):**  food system as you have been thus far.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:17:08):**  And then it would mean that like on part of my hectares or acres, I will plant white beans  
**[0:17:13-0:17:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:17:13):**  in this case and you will with an offtake agreement and that will add an interesting  
**[0:17:17-0:17:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:17:17):**  income stream instead of putting, I don't know, solar panels on the land or instead  
**[0:17:22-0:17:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:17:22):**  of doing some other crop, et cetera, to basically add to the small scale dairy that I'm operating.  
**[0:17:28-0:17:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:17:28):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:17:29):**  Exactly.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:17:30):**  How do you see that playing out for like that you say we're fighting against or we're competing  
**[0:17:35-0:17:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:17:35):**  against or what we want to change is the big dairy.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:17:37):**  What do you see there happening?  
**[0:17:40-0:17:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:17:40):**  Some of them are entering the space that you're in as well, probably not with the same values  
**[0:17:44-0:17:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:17:44):**  and intentions, but what do you see that whole discussion on the large, definitely not alternative  
**[0:17:50-0:17:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:17:50):**  protein companies starting to enter the space of the alternative protein companies buying  
**[0:17:55-0:17:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:17:55):**  up some big ones, setting up funds.  
**[0:17:56-0:17:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:17:56):**  I mean, we see all the activities left and right.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:17:59):**  What's your thought there as a very active player in it?  
**[0:18:02-0:18:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:18:02):**  Yeah, I mean, I guess if the change happened, I actually don't necessarily mind how it happens.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:18:07):**  I would rather it happened a certain way, but much like with the renewable space with  
**[0:18:12-0:18:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:18:12):**  energy, the guys that are producing most of the fossil fuel energy are inevitably the  
**[0:18:18-0:18:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:18:18):**  people who can make the greatest change if they really put their time and effort into  
**[0:18:24-0:18:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:18:24):**  setting up a more sustainable energy sector.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:18:28):**  They have the infrastructure, they have the connections, they have the capital, they have  
**[0:18:31-0:18:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:18:31):**  the research and the manpower.  
**[0:18:34-0:18:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:18:34):**  It's a similar story with dairy.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:18:37):**  I don't think we're seeing the same kind of switch just yet.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:18:40):**  We're seeing quite a lot of protective moves happening in Europe surrounding the naming  
**[0:18:45-0:18:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:18:45):**  of products, the packaging of products and those sorts of things.  
**[0:18:49-0:18:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:18:49):**  Which means they're getting scared.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:18:51):**  Exactly.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:18:52):**  But change is definitely coming.  
**[0:18:54-0:18:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:18:54):**  I do think a carbon tax is on the horizon, which will dramatically change the price of  
**[0:18:58-0:19:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:18:58):**  food and force a lot of consumers to consider alternatives.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:19:03):**  I think the quality of the alternatives is getting a lot better.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:19:06):**  People are raising a lot of questions about factory farming and so all of these indicators  
**[0:19:11-0:19:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:19:11):**  are pushing towards a different system.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:19:16):**  I just hope that they decide to move with it rather than trying to fight against the  
**[0:19:21-0:19:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:19:21):**  tide.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:19:22):**  Because personally, even though we are a plant-based producer, we don't see a world without dairy.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:19:26):**  That's not the world we're trying to create.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:19:28):**  The world we do see is a world that can feed 10 billion people by 2050, in which scenario  
**[0:19:34-0:19:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:19:34):**  we're going to have to produce 70% more food.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:19:38):**  We're not going to do that with the current system.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:19:41):**  We need to just think about how we're allocating our resources, think about how we're growing  
**[0:19:46-0:19:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:19:46):**  our food and that requires a different kind of food system than the one we have now.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:19:52):**  To go a bit deeper into that analogy, I think we can learn a lot from the renewable energy  
**[0:19:56-0:19:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:19:56):**  space.  
**[0:19:57-0:20:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:19:57):**  You see some very large players moving and we can ask a lot of questions about it.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:20:02):**  But if you look just at Dong, which I think changed its name to Orset or something, the  
**[0:20:06-0:20:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:20:06):**  Danish oil and gas operator became a fully wind, one of the biggest wind developers in  
**[0:20:12-0:20:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:20:12):**  the world.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:20:13):**  Of course, it took a long shot.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:20:14):**  Of course, they sold their fossil assets.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:20:16):**  Somebody still owns them.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:20:17):**  They're not completely retired, but made a huge shift or transition and seems to be leading  
**[0:20:22-0:20:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:20:22):**  the pack at the moment.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:20:24):**  Others are sort of scrambling to catch up.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:20:26):**  What if you would be, let's say, the head of Friesland Campina, which is one of the  
**[0:20:30-0:20:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:20:30):**  biggest dairy cooperatives in the world based in the Netherlands.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:20:33):**  What would be like you're in control of the oil tanker?  
**[0:20:36-0:20:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:20:36):**  What would be your, you have maybe a couple of years because then shareholders are going  
**[0:20:39-0:20:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:20:39):**  to get very nervous, etc.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:20:40):**  What would be your first few steps to set up some change there?  
**[0:20:44-0:20:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:20:44):**  Because that's a massive dairy company, some small scale is still part of it, but I think  
**[0:20:48-0:20:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:20:48):**  most of it is large, large subsidy driven dairy.  
**[0:20:52-0:20:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:20:52):**  What would be your moves as the new appointed CEO?  
**[0:20:55-0:21:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:20:55):**  So I would love to see true cost accounting and a target for net positivity.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:21:01):**  So first up with the true cost accounting, as you mentioned, Friesland Campina is primarily  
**[0:21:07-0:21:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:21:07):**  propped up by subsidies or they're able to offer the price points they can because of  
**[0:21:12-0:21:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:21:12):**  subsidies.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:21:13):**  They're exporting all over the world with prices that local markets can't compete with  
**[0:21:18-0:21:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:21:18):**  because of the taxpayer money.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:21:21):**  So I would love to see them take a responsible stance and actually charge the price that  
**[0:21:27-0:21:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:21:27):**  should be charged for their products.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:21:29):**  It would lead inevitably to a loss in revenue, but I think the first player that moves here  
**[0:21:35-0:21:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:21:35):**  in the dairy space will get a lot of credit and that will resonate with consumers, I think.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:21:42):**  And then from a net positivity standpoint, it is very possible to regeneratively farm  
**[0:21:48-0:21:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:21:48):**  dairy and seek.  
**[0:21:50-0:21:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:21:50):**  Which is interesting to hear that from a plant based producer.  
**[0:21:53-0:21:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:21:53):**  Yeah.  
**[0:21:54-0:21:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:21:54):**  I mean, there's been a lot of reports, a lot of great stuff coming out of the US in particular  
**[0:21:58-0:22:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:21:58):**  with regards to regenerative dairy farming.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:22:01):**  And it's very clear that you can farm dairy in a regenerative way.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:22:06):**  So I think those would be the main things.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:22:09):**  But there's a but you have to radically change everything you're doing basically.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:22:13):**  Yeah, it would take huge change.  
**[0:22:16-0:22:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:22:16):**  And yeah, the capital implications would be mega.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:22:19):**  But I think even just setting a date that isn't a ridiculous thought on the horizon,  
**[0:22:24-0:22:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:22:24):**  but it's a 2030 2040 for targets, you know, maybe perhaps it was with 50 percent there  
**[0:22:29-0:22:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:22:29):**  by 2030, 100 percent there by 2040.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:22:32):**  That would still be an improvement on now where it's, you know, an interesting conversation,  
**[0:22:37-0:22:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:22:37):**  but not really one that they're taking.  
**[0:22:40-0:22:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:22:40):**  Like in the UK, we're banning the sales of all internal combustion engine or ICE vehicles  
**[0:22:45-0:22:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:22:45):**  by 2030.  
**[0:22:46-0:22:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:22:46):**  Yeah.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:22:47):**  And it would have happened anyway, probably because it's going so fast now in electric  
**[0:22:51-0:22:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:22:51):**  transportation.  
**[0:22:52-0:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:22:52):**  But it's even if it doesn't reach out, like it creates suddenly everybody's scrambling  
**[0:22:56-0:22:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:22:56):**  and starting to like this is real.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:22:58):**  This is going to happen if it's 2031 or 2032 or 2029.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:23:02):**  Doesn't really matter.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:23:03):**  But it's the move is there.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:23:05):**  And that would be very powerful to put a net positive statement out there.  
**[0:23:09-0:23:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:23:09):**  And then very interesting.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:23:11):**  Yeah, I think it's also the responsibility of shareholders and the market.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:23:15):**  I mean, everything is driven by today, but I've been reading a lot of recently about  
**[0:23:19-0:23:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:23:19):**  intergenerational thinking.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:23:21):**  You're reading the good ancestor or not.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:23:25):**  I just started like a week ago, maybe I'm only page 20.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:23:28):**  But yeah, it's interesting.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:23:29):**  Yeah, it's a really interesting topic.  
**[0:23:31-0:23:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:23:31):**  And it's tapping into a lot of existing conversations.  
**[0:23:33-0:23:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:23:33):**  So a lot of the ideas aren't necessarily new, but it's providing a kind of framework or  
**[0:23:38-0:23:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:23:38):**  a way of looking at it.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:23:40):**  But I just love the notion of always thinking about, okay, so what is the future generation  
**[0:23:46-0:23:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:23:46):**  going to think of us?  
**[0:23:48-0:23:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:23:48):**  Because when you put it into that context, you remove your own individual ego, you remove  
**[0:23:54-0:23:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:23:54):**  the present day.  
**[0:23:55-0:23:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:23:55):**  And I think then you make much better decisions.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:23:58):**  And we have to act on things today.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:24:00):**  But we should be acting on things today, knowing they're going to be better tomorrow, 20 years,  
**[0:24:05-0:24:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:24:05):**  50 years, 100 years time.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:24:07):**  Seven generations.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:24:08):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:24:09):**  There's that wonderful group in North America that think in a seven generational way, which  
**[0:24:15-0:24:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:24:15):**  is very inspirational.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:24:16):**  And I'm really then like, how do you get that into and Frisant Campina is a sort of different  
**[0:24:21-0:24:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:24:21):**  story because they are cooperative.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:24:23):**  So they might have or they could have a longer term view.  
**[0:24:25-0:24:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:24:25):**  But if you look at Danone, for instance, great example that are sort of control, like, I  
**[0:24:30-0:24:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:24:30):**  mean, they have a longer term view on some shareholders, but now they get an activist  
**[0:24:33-0:24:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:24:33):**  one that actually is pushing to Emmanuel Faber to change because they need to need results  
**[0:24:38-0:24:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:24:38):**  per quarter.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:24:40):**  What can we do there too?  
**[0:24:41-0:24:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:24:41):**  Because that seems to be that really the underlying every quarter or at least every six months,  
**[0:24:47-0:24:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:24:47):**  I need to show X growth or X, which completely takes you away from investing for five or  
**[0:24:52-0:24:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:24:52):**  10 years, which used to be the case.  
**[0:24:54-0:24:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:24:54):**  And so what I mean, it's a very difficult question.  
**[0:24:56-0:24:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:24:56):**  This is a rabbit hole.  
**[0:24:57-0:25:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:24:57):**  But if you're running a company, let's say you're now CEO of Danone and you have these  
**[0:25:00-0:25:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:25:00):**  activities, you have these shareholders that are pushing, like, how would you counteract  
**[0:25:04-0:25:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:25:04):**  that?  
**[0:25:05-0:25:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:25:05):**  Do you have any?  
**[0:25:06-0:25:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:25:06):**  They're long term things and they should be because that's kind of important.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:25:09):**  But they are thinking short term of their next shareholder, their next report coming  
**[0:25:13-0:25:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:25:13):**  out.  
**[0:25:14-0:25:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:25:14):**  We're actually looking at this ourselves at the moment about how we solidify impact decisions.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:25:20):**  And so there's a few things that you can do from what we've seen from other organizations.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:25:26):**  So one is appointing an impact board, which is kind of slightly separate to the main function  
**[0:25:32-0:25:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:25:32):**  of the business.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:25:33):**  And it's a neutral body and they are given certain decisions on certain components.  
**[0:25:40-0:25:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:25:40):**  So, for example, if it's a spend, if it's a packaging decision, if it's just a major  
**[0:25:46-0:25:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:25:46):**  investment that could mean that the company is not making a responsible decision, that  
**[0:25:51-0:25:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:25:51):**  impact board then votes on it.  
**[0:25:55-0:25:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:25:55):**  So they kind of have a golden share.  
**[0:25:57-0:26:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:25:57):**  The golden share is another option.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:26:00):**  We had Armin Storjanagel of Purpose Ventures a while ago.  
**[0:26:03-0:26:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:26:03):**  I should definitely check in with them again.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:26:05):**  But they're like, who controls the steering wheel of your company, even if Unilever puts  
**[0:26:11-0:26:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:26:11):**  half a billion on the table or whatever, a crazy amount that changes everybody's lives?  
**[0:26:15-0:26:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:26:15):**  Like, how do you make sure you stay impact driven and long term focused?  
**[0:26:18-0:26:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:26:18):**  It has to do with legal stuff.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:26:20):**  It has to do with controlling certain decisions.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:26:23):**  Also when you're not there anymore, because maybe you moved on to something else and maybe  
**[0:26:26-0:26:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:26:26):**  the key people of the team have changed.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:26:28):**  How do you create organizations that last much longer than we are used to now?  
**[0:26:32-0:26:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:26:32):**  Yeah, well, it's interesting to look back on the origins of a company which were initially  
**[0:26:38-0:26:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:26:38):**  set up as a for good service for society.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:26:43):**  But now it's got a very different route.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:26:46):**  So I think we need to return back to that idea of service and making society, the planet,  
**[0:26:53-0:26:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:26:53):**  whatever it might be, a better and improved place by our actions.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:26:58):**  And companies are, I mean, I'm not bashing against that.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:27:00):**  I think it's the strongest organization form we have.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:27:03):**  It's just it's a tool as everything else, which means you need to really make sure you  
**[0:27:07-0:27:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:27:07):**  structure it well and think of all the bad stuff that can happen and all the annoying  
**[0:27:12-0:27:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:27:12):**  things that can come around to make sure if you're interested in long term stuff that  
**[0:27:16-0:27:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:27:16):**  it can run for 20, 30 years, because then you're going to have the biggest impact and  
**[0:27:20-0:27:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:27:20):**  not sell after three or four or five or whatever the crazy it is now.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:27:24):**  Yeah.  
**[0:27:25-0:27:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:27:25):**  And to come back to kind of our supply chain and that kind of thinking, we have to be thinking  
**[0:27:31-0:27:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:27:31):**  in decade long periods because we very much want to have a regenerative supply chain,  
**[0:27:35-0:27:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:27:35):**  but we also have to be realistic that it's not going to happen overnight and we have  
**[0:27:39-0:27:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:27:39):**  to really work and fight to make it happen.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:27:41):**  And therefore that long term thinking is absolutely crucial.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:27:44):**  And if we're looking at, I love to ask this question, which is always a bit lengthy, but  
**[0:27:48-0:27:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:27:48):**  the ITN framework, the importance, tractability and neglectedness, importance meaning what's  
**[0:27:52-0:27:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:27:52):**  the scale of the problem.  
**[0:27:53-0:27:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:27:53):**  I think the scale of the problem of industrial dairy, let's say, is very clear.  
**[0:27:58-0:28:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:27:58):**  Many people for sure still underestimate the just a sheer impact of factory farming in  
**[0:28:02-0:28:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:28:02):**  general, both for meat, dairy and other animal products.  
**[0:28:05-0:28:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:28:05):**  So if this would be fixed, a lot would be better.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:28:07):**  But if it fixed the proper way, the tractability, like how solvable is it?  
**[0:28:11-0:28:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:28:11):**  I think you're starting to unpack that.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:28:14):**  Like how solvable is it if not using certain nuts that are very damaging?  
**[0:28:18-0:28:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:28:18):**  We found out like that's something, but neglectedness, like how would you rate your work if you look  
**[0:28:22-0:28:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:28:22):**  at the importance, the tractability and how many other people basically are working on  
**[0:28:26-0:28:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:28:26):**  it?  
**[0:28:27-0:28:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:28:27):**  It sounds like it's, of course, pretty high, but what's your feeling on that, your work  
**[0:28:31-0:28:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:28:31):**  at Willicroft?  
**[0:28:32-0:28:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:28:32):**  Yeah.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:28:33):**  So in terms of an important standpoint, I do think it is very important work.  
**[0:28:38-0:28:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:28:38):**  The emissions of food, well, food is the biggest emitting sector of all.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:28:42):**  When you look at every part of the chain, also dairy cheese is the third emitting food  
**[0:28:48-0:28:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:28:48):**  type.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:28:49):**  So I think the importance is really clear.  
**[0:28:52-0:28:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:28:52):**  And on the plant based side, we're not seeing enough accountability traceability with current  
**[0:28:58-0:28:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:28:58):**  players on the market.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:28:59):**  So it's really important that we take a proactive stance in showing an example of how to kind  
**[0:29:05-0:29:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:29:05):**  of map out these LCA's and build a supply chain that is a bit more responsible.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:29:12):**  And then on the solvability, I think maybe first, it's good to mention the uptake.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:29:16):**  So the uptake now is incredible with plant based alternatives.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:29:19):**  I mean, in the UK, 25% of all milk sold is plant based and there's only actually 1% vegans  
**[0:29:26-0:29:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:29:26):**  in the UK or 1.5%.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:29:28):**  So that's a huge proportion of flexitarians.  
**[0:29:31-0:29:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:29:31):**  So the quality of the product is there.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:29:34):**  But again, to go back to the kind of improvements that all the sort of traceability and the  
**[0:29:40-0:29:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:29:40):**  accountability to the environment, that is where there's much, much work to be done.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:29:46):**  And this is kind of, I think, the second phase of the plant based space.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:29:51):**  I think the first phase was really just products coming onto the market and a lot of excitement.  
**[0:29:58-0:30:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:29:58):**  And now I think consumers are going to...  
**[0:30:00-0:30:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:30:00):**  Totally going through the roof.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:30:02):**  And yeah, that's it.  
**[0:30:03-0:30:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:30:03):**  And everybody's starting to pay attention.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:30:05):**  I mean, many people did five years ago, but now it's really different.  
**[0:30:08-0:30:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:30:08):**  And now we need to have that discussion on ingredients, but also on processing and what  
**[0:30:13-0:30:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:30:13):**  does it actually do to your body?  
**[0:30:14-0:30:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:30:14):**  We know much more about dairy, but definitely not health benefits and the health benefits.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:30:19):**  But now we need to have that discussion about white bean cheese, because otherwise we're  
**[0:30:23-0:30:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:30:23):**  just replacing one thing for the other.  
**[0:30:24-0:30:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:30:24):**  Yeah.  
**[0:30:25-0:30:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:30:25):**  No, the worst thing we can do is create another problem by solving one.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:30:29):**  I mean, that's not helping anything.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:30:30):**  So yeah, I think this next phase is really about delving into those things you've mentioned.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:30:36):**  Also really understanding the impact on our planet's health, but also on humanity's health  
**[0:30:41-0:30:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:30:41):**  as well.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:30:42):**  How is that happening?  
**[0:30:43-0:30:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:30:43):**  Like what's your view on that?  
**[0:30:45-0:30:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:30:45):**  Because obviously you cannot do 30 year randomized control trials with fixing or replacing one  
**[0:30:50-0:30:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:30:50):**  cheese for the other.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:30:51):**  Like what are you seeing that in white beans?  
**[0:30:53-0:30:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:30:53):**  Like how much do you have to process it?  
**[0:30:55-0:30:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:30:55):**  What other ingredients are there that could trigger certain things?  
**[0:30:58-0:30:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:30:58):**  What's your view there?  
**[0:30:59-0:31:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:30:59):**  Yeah.  
**[0:31:00-0:31:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:31:00):**  I mean, the nice thing is that for most producers, we know a lot about the individual ingredients.  
**[0:31:06-0:31:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:31:06):**  So when they're combined as a combination, that's where we're perhaps still needing to  
**[0:31:11-0:31:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:31:11):**  learn at this stage.  
**[0:31:13-0:31:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:31:13):**  But I think the first step on the ingredients is there.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:31:17):**  There are some, you do look on the back of a pack sometimes on plant-based products and  
**[0:31:21-0:31:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:31:21):**  do question, you know, what are half of these things and why are there 25 ingredients in  
**[0:31:26-0:31:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:31:26):**  a single product?  
**[0:31:27-0:31:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:31:27):**  I think that is somewhere that needs to change.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:31:29):**  But we're seeing things like the NutriScore come out in Europe, which is a standard kind  
**[0:31:34-0:31:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:31:34):**  of health scoring mechanism.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:31:37):**  And as I said, I do think a carbon tax on food is not too far away from an emissions  
**[0:31:42-0:31:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:31:42):**  standpoint, at least on a trial basis in an individual country.  
**[0:31:47-0:31:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:31:47):**  But these are all areas that need a lot more work and input.  
**[0:31:50-0:31:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:31:50):**  And we're really at the beginning.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:31:52):**  And from your customer perspective, like your openness on emissions and ingredients now,  
**[0:31:57-0:32:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:31:57):**  because you're on that journey, you're talking about it, you're releasing an impact report,  
**[0:32:01-0:32:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:32:01):**  what has been the response from your customers that you're switching from nuts to other things?  
**[0:32:05-0:32:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:32:05):**  Whether you weren't so sustainable as you hoped you were, but what has been your, because  
**[0:32:09-0:32:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:32:09):**  you for sure have many fans, what has been their involvement, response, et cetera, on  
**[0:32:14-0:32:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:32:14):**  this journey?  
**[0:32:15-0:32:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:32:15):**  We've never had anyone negatively look at it because I think we've always been quite  
**[0:32:21-0:32:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:32:21):**  open the minute we've had information at hand.  
**[0:32:25-0:32:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:32:25):**  And I think where people get frustrated is when there's a problem, but you don't address  
**[0:32:30-0:32:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:32:30):**  the solution or when you try and hide the problem.  
**[0:32:33-0:32:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:32:33):**  So I mean, some of the companies that I admire the most are ones that always kind of look  
**[0:32:40-0:32:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:32:40):**  in the mirror and take action at what they see.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:32:43):**  Companies like Patagonia, for example, they started using organic cotton in the 90s, but  
**[0:32:49-0:32:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:32:49):**  the uptake across the whole fashion industry has actually been really low.  
**[0:32:54-0:32:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:32:54):**  And they see that as quite a personal kind of setback, that they haven't been able to  
**[0:32:58-0:33:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:32:58):**  drive the change that they would have liked.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:33:01):**  And I think it's really fantastic when a company is constantly trying to improve, constantly  
**[0:33:07-0:33:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:33:07):**  trying to evolve.  
**[0:33:08-0:33:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:33:08):**  And the minute you put numbers behind anything, you can look to improve beyond those things.  
**[0:33:14-0:33:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:33:14):**  When you're just basing your actions on assumptions, that's a dangerous place to be.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:33:19):**  As you learned.  
**[0:33:20-0:33:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:33:20):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:33:21):**  Yeah, but I can imagine, let's say the customers in the vegan space can be quite, I don't know,  
**[0:33:28-0:33:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:33:28):**  focused on that.  
**[0:33:29-0:33:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:33:29):**  And it's interesting as a company takes them on a journey as well.  
**[0:33:32-0:33:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:33:32):**  There is a world beyond and maybe some of the other vegan things or plant based things  
**[0:33:36-0:33:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:33:36):**  you're buying are 25 ingredients and actually are not that clean.  
**[0:33:40-0:33:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:33:40):**  You're not saying that, but basically, of course, implicitly you are by making the moves  
**[0:33:44-0:33:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:33:44):**  yourself and having a cleaner ingredient list and having potentially the carbon on it and  
**[0:33:49-0:33:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:33:49):**  et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:33:50):**  So it's yeah, maybe it's a message that some people don't want to hear because it makes  
**[0:33:53-0:33:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:33:53):**  life a lot more complicated.  
**[0:33:55-0:33:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:33:55):**  Yeah.  
**[0:33:56-0:34:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:33:56):**  No, I mean, I think anyone who is willing and able to look at things pragmatically and  
**[0:34:01-0:34:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:34:01):**  with nuance and depth sees that this is absolutely the right path.  
**[0:34:06-0:34:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:34:06):**  Anyone who's looking for a headline might see it differently.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:34:11):**  And imagine an audience of smart impact investors listening to this conversation, like with  
**[0:34:16-0:34:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:34:16):**  all the attention there is for plant based at the moment, what would you advise them  
**[0:34:19-0:34:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:34:19):**  obviously without giving investment advice, but what would you advise them in terms of  
**[0:34:24-0:34:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:34:24):**  directions to ask directions to look at?  
**[0:34:26-0:34:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:34:26):**  Like what if you will be investing in the space?  
**[0:34:29-0:34:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:34:29):**  What would you be looking at?  
**[0:34:30-0:34:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:34:30):**  What is exciting to you now as you're so deep into the process?  
**[0:34:33-0:34:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:34:33):**  I think a good tasting product is not enough.  
**[0:34:36-0:34:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:34:36):**  I think you really have to have something that is looking at a multitude of factors,  
**[0:34:42-0:34:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:34:42):**  really delving into supply chain, really looking at where things are from, you know, who are  
**[0:34:47-0:34:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:34:47):**  the people behind producing these ingredients and also the health components of the product  
**[0:34:52-0:34:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:34:52):**  as well.  
**[0:34:53-0:34:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:34:53):**  And I think a very much kind of long term view is important because there are a lot  
**[0:34:59-0:35:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:34:59):**  of things that seem to be sort of, I don't want to use the word fad, but I just have  
**[0:35:06-0:35:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:35:06):**  a better word to describe that basically, it seems like there's a lot of kind of quick  
**[0:35:11-0:35:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:35:11):**  fixes and things that don't necessarily have that much depth to it.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:35:15):**  And I think what this huge growth is really exciting to see.  
**[0:35:20-0:35:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:35:20):**  And I think it's fantastic that a lot of options are now available.  
**[0:35:24-0:35:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:35:24):**  I just hope that we learn from other lessons.  
**[0:35:28-0:35:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:35:28):**  And as we mentioned earlier, we don't create other issues by bringing something new onto  
**[0:35:33-0:35:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:35:33):**  the market that hasn't been totally thought through.  
**[0:35:36-0:35:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:35:36):**  So that's maybe a word of warning.  
**[0:35:40-0:35:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:35:40):**  Digging deeper.  
**[0:35:41-0:35:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:35:41):**  Yeah.  
**[0:35:42-0:35:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:35:42):**  And there's a lot coming out now, a lot of noise, like always when stuff starts heating  
**[0:35:45-0:35:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:35:45):**  up, everybody jumps on it.  
**[0:35:47-0:35:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:35:47):**  If you would be running an investment fund with a crazy amount, let's say a billion,  
**[0:35:51-0:35:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:35:51):**  what would you be looking at?  
**[0:35:53-0:35:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:35:53):**  What would you be investing in starting tomorrow when you're head of this newly created investment  
**[0:35:59-0:36:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:35:59):**  fund?  
**[0:36:00-0:36:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:36:00):**  You can spend it whatever you want, not in grand capital, it has to be investment, but  
**[0:36:03-0:36:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:36:03):**  could be extremely long term.  
**[0:36:05-0:36:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:36:05):**  What would be your priority list?  
**[0:36:07-0:36:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:36:07):**  What would be your focus?  
**[0:36:08-0:36:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:36:08):**  So can I mention a couple of things?  
**[0:36:11-0:36:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:36:11):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:36:12-0:36:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:36:12):**  You can do a whole list if you want.  
**[0:36:13-0:36:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:36:13):**  You can do 50 million each, five million each or whatever you want to take in terms of space.  
**[0:36:18-0:36:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:36:18):**  Some people answer with, I would put it all in X and some others have a whole list of  
**[0:36:23-0:36:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:36:23):**  things they want to look into.  
**[0:36:24-0:36:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:36:24):**  But I'm asking it because I'd like to look into your head and what would you prioritize?  
**[0:36:29-0:36:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:36:29):**  I'm not asking because we need to know exactly.  
**[0:36:32-0:36:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:36:32):**  It's going to be 55 million point six.  
**[0:36:35-0:36:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:36:35):**  What is the first things you would go after and with more or less, how would you split  
**[0:36:38-0:36:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:36:38):**  it up?  
**[0:36:39-0:36:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:36:39):**  I really, really believe that lobbying is fundamental to us changing so many things  
**[0:36:47-0:36:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:36:47):**  about our food system.  
**[0:36:48-0:36:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:36:48):**  The guys who are lobbying at the moment do not really care about the planet and they're  
**[0:36:52-0:36:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:36:52):**  protecting single interests and the status quo.  
**[0:36:57-0:37:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:36:57):**  So I would put a lot of that money into lobbying, which would probably lead to being fired at  
**[0:37:03-0:37:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:37:03):**  VC because it's not going to lead to instant return.  
**[0:37:06-0:37:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:37:06):**  But it would lead to a lot of widespread change.  
**[0:37:09-0:37:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:37:09):**  I really do think that that is a big part of what's happening now.  
**[0:37:13-0:37:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:37:13):**  And they would go after a carbon tax, they would go after...  
**[0:37:16-0:37:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:37:16):**  True cost accounting, carbon tax.  
**[0:37:20-0:37:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:37:20):**  Getting a lot of the really important fundamentals right so that the market price switches because  
**[0:37:26-0:37:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:37:26):**  as with renewables is the perfect example.  
**[0:37:28-0:37:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:37:28):**  Now that so many options are price comparable, people are buying electric cars, people are  
**[0:37:33-0:37:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:37:33):**  using renewable energy.  
**[0:37:35-0:37:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:37:35):**  So I think with food, we need to go and look at a similar sort of model.  
**[0:37:41-0:37:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:37:41):**  I would also look to support projects that are really promoting the regenerative label.  
**[0:37:47-0:37:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:37:47):**  I think we've got this amazing momentum now behind regenerative farming, but we now need  
**[0:37:52-0:37:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:37:52):**  tangible things that we can buy in supermarkets.  
**[0:37:57-0:38:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:37:57):**  So you would go after food companies, the food company side of things.  
**[0:38:00-0:38:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:38:00):**  And I think what's maybe missing at this stage is finished products.  
**[0:38:04-0:38:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:38:04):**  We've got a lot of ingredients that can be regenerative, but making that into a product  
**[0:38:09-0:38:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:38:09):**  is the next phase, I think.  
**[0:38:10-0:38:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:38:10):**  So I would try and support projects that are looking to do that because I think that is  
**[0:38:15-0:38:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:38:15):**  an important step.  
**[0:38:16-0:38:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:38:16):**  That is something we personally are struggling with at this stage.  
**[0:38:20-0:38:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:38:20):**  We can get 50% there perhaps, but we're not going to be able to get the whole way there  
**[0:38:25-0:38:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:38:25):**  at this stage.  
**[0:38:26-0:38:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:38:26):**  So then would you invest in companies like Wheeligroft or would you invest in your suppliers  
**[0:38:32-0:38:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:38:32):**  that then buy from farmers to get more ready ingredients for you to make your cheeses or  
**[0:38:38-0:38:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:38:38):**  for others to make other things?  
**[0:38:40-0:38:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:38:40):**  Because you mentioned before, it's difficult to get, I mean, maybe some of the supply of  
**[0:38:44-0:38:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:38:44):**  the white beans or et cetera, et cetera is there, but then the transformation piece seems  
**[0:38:49-0:38:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:38:49):**  to be missing.  
**[0:38:50-0:38:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:38:50):**  Is that what you're saying?  
**[0:38:51-0:38:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:38:51):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:38:52-0:38:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:38:52):**  Exactly.  
**[0:38:53-0:38:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:38:53):**  I think we need more ingredients and farms that are using these models.  
**[0:38:56-0:39:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:38:56):**  So yeah, I think it has to start there.  
**[0:39:00-0:39:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:39:00):**  We need to plant these seeds now because it will probably not come into fruition for five  
**[0:39:06-0:39:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:39:06):**  to 10 years.  
**[0:39:07-0:39:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:39:07):**  So yeah, I think we have to get a lot of the fundamentals right at either end of the spectrum.  
**[0:39:13-0:39:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:39:13):**  You've got the lobbying at the top and then the farmers, which are obviously the rooters  
**[0:39:18-0:39:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:39:18):**  of everything and the soil.  
**[0:39:20-0:39:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:39:20):**  And that will ensure that everything in between starts to adjust in the right way.  
**[0:39:25-0:39:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:39:25):**  If you could change one thing, so we took away your fund, I'm very sorry, but you have  
**[0:39:28-0:39:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:39:28):**  a magic wand and a magic power to change one thing, only one.  
**[0:39:31-0:39:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:39:31):**  So you cannot say carbon tax and true or cost accounting.  
**[0:39:34-0:39:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:39:34):**  What would you go after if you could change one thing in the ag and food industry, which  
**[0:39:37-0:39:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:39:37):**  could be anything, could be global consciousness, could be, I mean, we've had many, many, you've  
**[0:39:41-0:39:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:39:41):**  heard some episodes, many, many different answers to this question, but what would be  
**[0:39:45-0:39:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:39:45):**  your one change?  
**[0:39:46-0:39:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:39:46):**  Yeah, I had to ponder on that for quite some time.  
**[0:39:49-0:39:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:39:49):**  That's why I ask it.  
**[0:39:50-0:39:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:39:50):**  Yeah, I do think it is this though.  
**[0:39:52-0:40:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:39:52):**  I think I would love to see us return to our grandparents diet, which sounds strange, but  
**[0:40:00-0:40:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:40:00):**  that would solve so many problems.  
**[0:40:02-0:40:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:40:02):**  We wouldn't have this huge dependence on meat.  
**[0:40:06-0:40:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:40:06):**  We would be paying the true cost of things.  
**[0:40:09-0:40:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:40:09):**  There are so many things that were got right at that stage.  
**[0:40:12-0:40:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:40:12):**  I mean, if you look at the cost of the household spend in America, for example, now on food,  
**[0:40:17-0:40:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:40:17):**  it's gone from 20% per family down to 10%, yet they're eating more meat than ever, more  
**[0:40:24-0:40:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:40:24):**  dairy.  
**[0:40:25-0:40:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:40:25):**  And you know, these things just don't add up.  
**[0:40:27-0:40:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:40:27):**  So I would go back to a bygone era.  
**[0:40:32-0:40:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:40:32):**  And go forward sort of, because I think there's a lot of, because I don't think we want to  
**[0:40:36-0:40:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:40:36):**  go back to the back breaking.  
**[0:40:37-0:40:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:40:37):**  No.  
**[0:40:38-0:40:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:40:38):**  I mean, they got many things right, but many things not so much as well.  
**[0:40:42-0:40:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:40:42):**  But there's an interesting, I think on the diet part and the changing diet that can really  
**[0:40:46-0:40:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:40:46):**  lead to a lot of change.  
**[0:40:48-0:40:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:40:48):**  Like if we not incorporate nuts everywhere because that has its issues, but if we like  
**[0:40:53-0:40:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:40:53):**  just the peas and legumes, just the there's massive switches that leads to simply by switching  
**[0:40:59-0:41:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:40:59):**  a few things in your diet and we need to push for a lot of other things.  
**[0:41:02-0:41:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:41:02):**  But I think that's a, and it was much healthier.  
**[0:41:04-0:41:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:41:04):**  I mean, if you look at the current health crisis, which comes from many different reasons,  
**[0:41:08-0:41:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:41:08):**  but very much comes from industrial chemical driven input driven farming ways.  
**[0:41:13-0:41:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:41:13):**  And then what we eat out of it, it's a massive, an absolute massive one.  
**[0:41:17-0:41:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:41:17):**  Yeah.  
**[0:41:18-0:41:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:41:18):**  The nutritionals behind the food now and then is another crazy comparative point.  
**[0:41:23-0:41:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:41:23):**  Yeah.  
**[0:41:24-0:41:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:41:24):**  There was a lot.  
**[0:41:25-0:41:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:41:25):**  Do you get questions on that?  
**[0:41:26-0:41:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:41:26):**  Like vegan cheese compared to dairy cheese?  
**[0:41:28-0:41:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:41:28):**  What does it mean for me, for my body basically?  
**[0:41:31-0:41:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:41:31):**  And what do you answer to that?  
**[0:41:32-0:41:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:41:32):**  Yeah, we do.  
**[0:41:33-0:41:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:41:33):**  We do actually.  
**[0:41:34-0:41:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:41:34):**  We're actually doing a kind of synopsis directly comparing each cheese to the dairy equivalent  
**[0:41:39-0:41:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:41:39):**  at the moment.  
**[0:41:40-0:41:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:41:40):**  They shape up pretty well.  
**[0:41:41-0:41:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:41:41):**  I think one thing though, that is always worth bearing in mind is we are trying to create  
**[0:41:46-0:41:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:41:46):**  cheese.  
**[0:41:47-0:41:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:41:47):**  So it's not like it's a, we're creating a super food.  
**[0:41:51-0:41:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:41:51):**  Therefore that, you know, can taste like cheese, but also give you your five a day and all  
**[0:41:56-0:41:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:41:56):**  of your millions of vitamins and stuff.  
**[0:41:59-0:42:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:41:59):**  So we heed caution when people shouldn't only eat this.  
**[0:42:03-0:42:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:42:03):**  You definitely shouldn't only eat Wurtecraft and you can definitely quote me on that.  
**[0:42:07-0:42:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:42:07):**  And you shouldn't only eat cheese in general.  
**[0:42:09-0:42:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:42:09):**  Yeah, no, it's part of a diet.  
**[0:42:10-0:42:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:42:10):**  Obviously of a hopefully diverse.  
**[0:42:12-0:42:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:42:12):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:42:13-0:42:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:42:13):**  Yeah.  
**[0:42:14-0:42:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:42:14):**  Yeah.  
**[0:42:15-0:42:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:42:15):**  And what would you be busy this year?  
**[0:42:16-0:42:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:42:16):**  We're still sort of at the beginning of 2020, not really.  
**[0:42:19-0:42:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:42:19):**  We're in March already.  
**[0:42:20-0:42:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:42:20):**  Don't know how fast that went, but what's your, apart from the whole ingredient, the  
**[0:42:24-0:42:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:42:24):**  launching the new cheeses or improved cheeses or changed cheeses, what other big projects  
**[0:42:28-0:42:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:42:28):**  are you working on?  
**[0:42:29-0:42:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:42:29):**  If you could actually work on something else, because this is a massive one.  
**[0:42:32-0:42:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:42:32):**  No, so that's taking up a lot of time, the switch from nut concert to beans and legumes.  
**[0:42:37-0:42:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:42:37):**  But we're also just about to release our first impact report.  
**[0:42:41-0:42:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:42:41):**  And so that's been a real focus for the team this year.  
**[0:42:44-0:42:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:42:44):**  Which should be out at the moment.  
**[0:42:45-0:42:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:42:45):**  I will link it below, obviously, for anybody listening, which should be out by the time  
**[0:42:48-0:42:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:42:48):**  this interview is out.  
**[0:42:49-0:42:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:42:49):**  So thank you.  
**[0:42:50-0:42:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:42:50):**  Yeah.  
**[0:42:51-0:42:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:42:51):**  And we're also doing some big campaigns this year to try and get some buy-in from other  
**[0:42:55-0:42:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:42:55):**  kind of plant-based producers and well, any kind of food producer actually.  
**[0:42:59-0:43:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:42:59):**  So the first campaign is surrounding making Mother Nature your CEO.  
**[0:43:05-0:43:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:43:05):**  So we appointed Mother Nature as our CEO last year.  
**[0:43:08-0:43:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:43:08):**  How has that been?  
**[0:43:09-0:43:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:43:09):**  She's doing an excellent job.  
**[0:43:10-0:43:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:43:10):**  Okay, great.  
**[0:43:11-0:43:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:43:11):**  She's been tough in places, but yeah, she's kept some straight and narrow, that's for  
**[0:43:16-0:43:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:43:16):**  sure.  
**[0:43:17-0:43:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:43:17):**  But no, we've put in quite a few requirements that a company needs to follow up on if they  
**[0:43:22-0:43:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:43:22):**  do make this appointment, because we don't want it just to be an appointment and then  
**[0:43:26-0:43:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:43:26):**  it's kind of left there.  
**[0:43:28-0:43:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:43:28):**  We do want to introduce certain requirements.  
**[0:43:30-0:43:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:43:30):**  So the sort of things we're looking at is committing to writing an impact report within  
**[0:43:35-0:43:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:43:35):**  two years, publishing emissions on packaging within the timeframe, looking at accreditations  
**[0:43:41-0:43:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:43:41):**  like B Corp and other kind of accreditations.  
**[0:43:45-0:43:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:43:45):**  So yeah, a set of goals to work towards essentially.  
**[0:43:48-0:43:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:43:48):**  That's a campaign we're doing in April.  
**[0:43:51-0:43:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:43:51):**  And then we're also putting our emissions on our packaging this year, which will be  
**[0:43:55-0:44:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:43:55):**  a really nice step, I think, because that's us really then saying to the consumers and  
**[0:44:00-0:44:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:44:00):**  to all of our sellers, you know, this is something that we really think should be given greater  
**[0:44:05-0:44:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:44:05):**  attention.  
**[0:44:06-0:44:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:44:06):**  So I would say those are the real, real core projects.  
**[0:44:10-0:44:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:44:10):**  And we're also really trying to make improvements in our supply chain and have our first two  
**[0:44:17-0:44:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:44:17):**  organic products coming out this year, which is really exciting.  
**[0:44:21-0:44:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:44:21):**  But there's still a lot of work to be done on the supply chain side.  
**[0:44:24-0:44:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:44:24):**  Yeah, I can imagine.  
**[0:44:25-0:44:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:44:25):**  And I love asking this question, slightly edited from Jon Kempf.  
**[0:44:29-0:44:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:44:29):**  What do you believe to be true about regenerative agriculture and food that others don't believe  
**[0:44:32-0:44:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:44:32):**  to be true?  
**[0:44:33-0:44:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:44:33):**  I do genuinely believe that it can be a label, a consumer label.  
**[0:44:38-0:44:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:44:38):**  I think organics virtues have led to some incredible improvements to the produce of  
**[0:44:45-0:44:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:44:45):**  food over the last 30 years.  
**[0:44:46-0:44:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:44:46):**  But I'm very glad that we're taking the next step because organic does have its limitations  
**[0:44:52-0:44:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:44:52):**  in certain countries.  
**[0:44:54-0:44:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:44:54):**  Are you going after ROC like regenerative organic?  
**[0:44:58-0:45:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:44:58):**  I will link the interview with Elizabeth below, which we released recently.  
**[0:45:01-0:45:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:45:01):**  Are you planning to go after, let's say, organic plus in this case, but also adding so animal  
**[0:45:06-0:45:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:45:06):**  health and obviously social sites to it?  
**[0:45:08-0:45:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:45:08):**  That is our goal.  
**[0:45:10-0:45:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:45:10):**  So we are hoping this year to know what time frames we have for that, because what I am  
**[0:45:16-0:45:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:45:16):**  very conscious of is making a statement about when we can achieve this.  
**[0:45:21-0:45:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:45:21):**  And we're still in the information gathering phase.  
**[0:45:24-0:45:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:45:24):**  So we can comfortably say we're going to be able to get organic with two products this  
**[0:45:29-0:45:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:45:29):**  year and many more in the future.  
**[0:45:31-0:45:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:45:31):**  But in terms of regenerative organic, which is definitely a goal, I don't want to commit  
**[0:45:37-0:45:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:45:37):**  at this stage.  
**[0:45:38-0:45:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:45:38):**  But we will do everything in our power to make it happen.  
**[0:45:41-0:45:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:45:41):**  Perfect.  
**[0:45:42-0:45:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:45:42):**  Thank you so much.

**[0:49:19-0:49:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:49:19):**  so you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:49:21-0:49:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:49:21):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:49:26-0:49:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:49:26):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:49:31-0:49:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:49:31):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[0:49:36-0:49:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:49:36):**  if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:49:38-0:49:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:49:38):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:49:42-0:49:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:49:42):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.

**[0:49:52-0:49:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:49:52):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:49:54-0:49:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:49:54):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:49:57-0:50:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:49:57):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:50:00-0:50:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/brad-vanstone#t=0:50:00):**  It's also not investment advice.

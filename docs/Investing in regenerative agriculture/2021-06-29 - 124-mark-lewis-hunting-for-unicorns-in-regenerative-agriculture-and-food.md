**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:00:14):**  Searching for the Elon Musk of Regenec, a classic venture capital structure with a deep  
**[0:00:18-0:00:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:00:18):**  focus on regenerative agriculture and food, and why it makes sense to have both technology  
**[0:00:23-0:00:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:00:23):**  and consumer-focused products in the same fund.  
**[0:00:28-0:00:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:00:28):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture, Investing as if the  
**[0:00:33-0:00:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:00:33):**  Planet Mattered, a podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and  
**[0:00:37-0:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:00:37):**  agriculture space to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil,  
**[0:00:42-0:00:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:00:42):**  people, local communities and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:48-0:00:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:00:48):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:50-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:00:50):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:00:54-0:00:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:00:54):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat, and it's time that we as investors, big and small,  
**[0:00:59-0:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:00:59):**  and consumers start paying much more attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:01:06):**  In March last year we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support  
**[0:01:10-0:01:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:01:10):**  our work, and so many of you have joined as a member.

**[0:01:31-0:01:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:01:31):**  Welcome to another episode today with Mark Lewis, managing partner at Trailhead Capital.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:01:37):**  Welcome Mark.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:01:38):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:01:39):**  Pleased to be here.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:01:40):**  Thanks for having me on.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:01:41):**  And to start with the question we always start with, how did you end up, first of all, managing  
**[0:01:45-0:01:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:01:45):**  partner at Trailhead Capital, but focusing on this investment piece of regenerative food  
**[0:01:50-0:01:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:01:50):**  agriculture?  
**[0:01:51-0:01:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:01:51):**  I was born and raised in Denver.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:01:53):**  My father was in the oil and gas business, so in traditional fossil fuel energy.  
**[0:01:58-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:01:58):**  And I went to undergraduate studies in San Diego, got in with the wrong crowd, started  
**[0:02:04-0:02:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:02:04):**  reading Bill McKibben and Herman Daly and natural capitalism and decided the climate  
**[0:02:10-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:02:10):**  crisis might be worth paying attention to and that we probably should transition to  
**[0:02:15-0:02:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:02:15):**  renewable fuels.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:02:16):**  So started with a biodiesel company.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:02:19):**  How did that land with your father?  
**[0:02:20-0:02:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:02:20):**  I don't want to open any Pandora boxes.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:02:22):**  We didn't prep this question, but now I'm curious.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:02:24):**  It has been a 20 year debate, mostly friendly, sometimes heated, but thankfully the climate  
**[0:02:32-0:02:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:02:32):**  science has continued to come in my direction.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:02:36):**  And how was last week for him or two weeks ago?  
**[0:02:39-0:02:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:02:39):**  Sorry.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:02:40):**  We are recording this for a background is beginning of June, just after the shell case  
**[0:02:43-0:02:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:02:43):**  Exxon and Chevron.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:02:45):**  I think there was an interesting week.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:02:47):**  I think more and more folks in the oil patch are understanding that this transition is  
**[0:02:51-0:02:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:02:51):**  inevitable and a lot of those firms are now making investments and actually some of them  
**[0:02:57-0:03:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:02:57):**  have more analysts on their renewable energy desk than they do on their oil and gas desk.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:03:02):**  And that's honestly, I think regenerative agriculture is where renewable energy was  
**[0:03:07-0:03:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:03:07):**  10 or 15 years ago.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:03:08):**  And to me, it's the same.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:03:10):**  What makes you say that?  
**[0:03:11-0:03:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:03:11):**  I always keep saying that as well.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:03:12):**  Like we can learn so much from renewable energy space, et cetera.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:03:15):**  As you actually, let's go back to your story.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:03:17):**  You were in renewable energies.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:03:19):**  What was that feeling that you now see or you now recognize in terms of where we are  
**[0:03:24-0:03:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:03:24):**  in region ag and food?  
**[0:03:25-0:03:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:03:25):**  Partly it's just that I think the big food and ag companies are now understanding the  
**[0:03:30-0:03:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:03:30):**  same thing that the fossil fuel companies are beginning to understand or understood  
**[0:03:34-0:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:03:34):**  10 years ago, which is that they have some liabilities on their books and that they no  
**[0:03:39-0:03:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:03:39):**  longer have the social license to operate in the same way.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:03:43):**  And they have multiple stakeholders that they're accountable to.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:03:47):**  And they, you can point a pretty straight line to some of their activities and how that  
**[0:03:53-0:03:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:03:53):**  affects our planetary health and human health.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:03:57):**  And the way in which our food is grown is by and large contributing to the climate crisis  
**[0:04:02-0:04:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:04:02):**  and contributing to the human health crisis.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:04:04):**  Do you see like we're going to have cases like Shell, is it going to take 10, 15 years  
**[0:04:09-0:04:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:04:09):**  or are going to be quicker with large food companies or large agriculture company?  
**[0:04:13-0:04:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:04:13):**  I think it's got to be quicker.  
**[0:04:14-0:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:04:14):**  I think the UN says this is the decisive decade.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:04:18):**  I don't think we have 15 years.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:04:19):**  And I think the information is more readily available.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:04:22):**  And hopefully big food and ag are more on the ball than big oil and gas were and recognize,  
**[0:04:30-0:04:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:04:30):**  okay, if we're more proactive about this and don't always resist and instead kind of lead.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:04:36):**  And I mean, JBS has made a claim that they're investing a billion dollars toward climate  
**[0:04:42-0:04:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:04:42):**  smart regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:04:44):**  JBS just for background, if people know, it's one of the largest, if not the largest meat  
**[0:04:50-0:04:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:04:50):**  producer processor in the world basically.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:04:53):**  Yeah.  
**[0:04:54-0:04:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:04:54):**  General Mills is transitioning a million acres to organic and regenerative practices.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:04:59):**  Cargill just made a big announcement about transitioning to begin with 50,000 acres of  
**[0:05:03-0:05:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:05:03):**  corn and soybeans to regenerative organic practices with the help of the Rodale Institute,  
**[0:05:09-0:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:05:09):**  which is a partner of ours at Trailhead Capital as well.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:05:12):**  So I think they're getting that ahead of it and I'm hopeful.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:05:14):**  I mean, that's kind of our, to cut to the punchline, I mean, our strategy is that our  
**[0:05:19-0:05:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:05:19):**  portfolio companies in our venture capital fund get acquired by big food and big ag companies  
**[0:05:25-0:05:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:05:25):**  who become more regenerative and shift into this new paradigm through acquisition.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:05:31):**  And I think that's two, three, five, 10 years away at the most.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:05:35):**  And do you see that acquisition is the most important piece or do you see standalone like  
**[0:05:42-0:05:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:05:42):**  breakout companies as well that can make it on their own with enough finance and funding,  
**[0:05:46-0:05:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:05:46):**  et cetera, et cetera, but like the unicorn, but not necessarily an exit to quote unquote,  
**[0:05:52-0:05:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:05:52):**  big evil food, which of course some people will have questions about and we can ask questions  
**[0:05:57-0:05:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:05:57):**  about the impact.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:05:58):**  And we know acquisitions go very well or very wrong.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:06:01):**  There's not really a middle ground.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:06:03):**  Do you see that standalone scenario as an option as well?  
**[0:06:05-0:06:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:06:05):**  And then we come back, I promise people listening, we come back to the story of biofuels where  
**[0:06:09-0:06:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:06:09):**  we left off this rebel hole.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:06:10):**  But do you see that standalone as an option as well as the sector is very interesting  
**[0:06:15-0:06:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:06:15):**  from that perspective, like there's space to build giants potentially.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:06:19):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:06:21):**  We would be delighted if one or more of our portfolio companies IPO'd and went public  
**[0:06:27-0:06:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:06:27):**  and built the competitor to the established players.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:06:31):**  And I think that's very possible.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:06:33):**  And I kind of joke that we are fishing for the Elon Musk of regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:06:40):**  People forget Elon Musk didn't start Tesla, but he sort of took it to where it is today.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:06:44):**  And so, yes, absolutely.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:06:46):**  I think there are opportunities for food and agriculture companies to become hundreds of  
**[0:06:52-0:06:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:06:52):**  billions of dollars valuations in a relatively short timeframe.  
**[0:06:56-0:06:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:06:56):**  So I'm hopeful that that happens as well.  
**[0:06:58-0:06:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:06:58):**  Okay.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:06:59):**  Now let's go back to biofuels.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:07:00):**  You were going to renewable energy space, ended up on biofuels and then what happened?  
**[0:07:04-0:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:07:04):**  Yeah.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:07:05):**  So the first job was I was cold calling restaurants, asking them what they were doing with their  
**[0:07:09-0:07:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:07:09):**  used cooking oil.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:07:10):**  And we were trying to turn that into B20 and B100 biodiesel.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:07:14):**  We had a conversation with Suncor, which is the largest refinery here in Denver.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:07:20):**  And we did the math that if we gave them everything we had, even if we had 100% market share of  
**[0:07:24-0:07:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:07:24):**  every restaurant in Colorado and gave them everything we had, it was going to be a B.2.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:07:30):**  So it was going to be 0.2% biodiesel blended with their petroleum diesel.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:07:34):**  So that's when I realized, okay, we've got to find something that's a little more scalable.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:07:38):**  Actually went back, got my MBA in Boulder.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:07:41):**  Or open a lot of frying restaurants.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:07:43):**  Yeah, that maybe is not the...  
**[0:07:45-0:07:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:07:45):**  Exactly.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:07:46):**  More deep fry.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:07:47):**  Exactly.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:07:48):**  And then joined up with a group called GSSG Solar.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:07:51):**  So it was the old global special situations group that spun out of Sun Edison.  
**[0:07:55-0:07:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:07:55):**  My family was the first investor in the GP.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:07:58):**  I then joined the team, helped to raise the first fund, raised a $46 million fund, ended  
**[0:08:04-0:08:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:08:04):**  up deploying all of that capital into Japan, which was not the original plan.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:08:10):**  But our timing was good with...  
**[0:08:12-0:08:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:08:12):**  So Fukushima obviously was devastating to the country.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:08:16):**  They took down all of their nuclear power, which was roughly 20% of their electric load,  
**[0:08:21-0:08:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:08:21):**  put in place what's called a feed-in tariff, which is a subsidy for solar power.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:08:25):**  And we went in and actually purchased a couple of golf courses in the Fukushima prefecture,  
**[0:08:29-0:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:08:29):**  where the country club members were no longer interested in playing golf in a radioactive  
**[0:08:34-0:08:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:08:34):**  zone.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:08:35):**  And we got grid interconnection and put solar panels on all the greens, fairways, tee boxes,  
**[0:08:41-0:08:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:08:41):**  assembled 174 megawatt portfolio, sold that to the JP Morgan Infrastructure Fund for a  
**[0:08:47-0:08:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:08:47):**  great return for our LPs.  
**[0:08:50-0:08:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:08:50):**  So that was kind of my first win with my dad to say, hey, look, this is Boulder Hippies.  
**[0:08:55-0:08:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:08:55):**  Yeah, because your family office was the first investor.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:08:58):**  I mean, then he must have seen, oh, that's interesting.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:09:01):**  Yeah.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:09:02):**  I was an L.P. in that fund and that was, you know, I was able to say, you know, JP Morgan's  
**[0:09:06-0:09:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:09:06):**  getting in this game.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:09:07):**  This isn't just for Boulder Hippies.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:09:09):**  I mean, this is big business.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:09:11):**  So then, you know, kind of frankly had the realization that even if we turned to 100%  
**[0:09:17-0:09:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:09:17):**  renewable energy tomorrow globally, we still have a big problem of 416 parts per million  
**[0:09:23-0:09:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:09:23):**  of CO2 in the atmosphere.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:09:24):**  So...  
**[0:09:25-0:09:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:09:25):**  Do you still remember what triggered that realization?  
**[0:09:28-0:09:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:09:28):**  Was it an app moment or a series of events?  
**[0:09:32-0:09:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:09:32):**  I think I just kept reading Bill McKibben, just kept studying climate science, which  
**[0:09:36-0:09:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:09:36):**  is you can get into a dark place if you don't turn to hopeful solutions.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:09:41):**  But yeah, Bill McKibben honestly is one of the bigger influences on me and his, you know,  
**[0:09:47-0:09:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:09:47):**  350.org.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:09:48):**  So, you know, for those who aren't familiar, the sweet spot of human civilization for many,  
**[0:09:53-0:09:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:09:53):**  many, many millennia was about 280 parts per million.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:09:57):**  And that's the stable climate that allowed us to flourish.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:10:00):**  And we're now, you know, up above 400.  
**[0:10:03-0:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:10:03):**  So that's what's causing climate instability.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:10:07):**  And so that's where I started studying direct air capture, geoengineering, and ultimately  
**[0:10:11-0:10:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:10:11):**  landed on, wow, regenerative agriculture and sequestering carbon into soil is, you know,  
**[0:10:18-0:10:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:10:18):**  maybe a nature-based solution that we should give that a shot first before kind of quote  
**[0:10:23-0:10:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:10:23):**  unquote playing God.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:10:25):**  So convinced my family then to purchase a farm.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:10:29):**  So we bought what's now Lewis Family Farm in 2013, 354 acres of certified organic ground  
**[0:10:35-0:10:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:10:35):**  just east of DIA.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:10:37):**  So if you fly in and out of Denver to the east, we have two of the big green circles,  
**[0:10:42-0:10:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:10:42):**  you know, center pivots that you fly over there.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:10:46):**  First year spread 80 semi loads of compost with the objective of supercharging the soil  
**[0:10:51-0:10:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:10:51):**  biology.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:10:52):**  We've moved more towards perennial crops, intensive cover cropping, crop rotation,  
**[0:10:58-0:11:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:10:58):**  livestock integration, and all, you know, trying to build up soil organic matter.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:11:02):**  That's kind of been my objective out there is to prove that you can sequester carbon  
**[0:11:07-0:11:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:11:07):**  and potentially increase yield and or nutrient density of the crops grown in that soil.  
**[0:11:14-0:11:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:11:14):**  So we've, you know, our bread and butter is kind of alfalfa hay, certified organic alfalfa  
**[0:11:19-0:11:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:11:19):**  that we sell to local organic dairies.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:11:22):**  And they pay us based on the relative feed quality, which is kind of an aggregate score  
**[0:11:26-0:11:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:11:26):**  of protein, carbohydrates, nutrients, minerals.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:11:31):**  So you get literally paid for quality.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:11:32):**  Exactly.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:11:33):**  And our we've kind of been tracking.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:11:34):**  So as we've gone from roughly 1.3% soil organic matter on average to two and a half, 3%, our  
**[0:11:41-0:11:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:11:41):**  relative feed quality has gone from 150, 180, 200.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:11:47):**  Last year we had one cutting that was 252 RFQ.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:11:50):**  So wow.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:11:51):**  And have you kept adding the organic material and compost?  
**[0:11:54-0:11:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:11:54):**  Or there was a one time shot and then management or how has that been going?  
**[0:11:59-0:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:11:59):**  We've done a couple of compost applications, a couple of manure applications.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:12:03):**  There's some studies out that show that that has diminishing returns once you sort of get  
**[0:12:08-0:12:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:12:08):**  to a certain level.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:12:10):**  I mean, we've also done green manure where you, you know, like a Sudan grass, other cover  
**[0:12:15-0:12:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:12:15):**  crop mixes that we've just plowed in everything, just trying to get more fibrous material for  
**[0:12:21-0:12:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:12:21):**  the bug life, the microbes, the bacteria, the fungi to feast on.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:12:26):**  We've made some mistakes for sure.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:12:28):**  And I, I wouldn't necessarily recommend my path to most folks, but it's been a journey  
**[0:12:35-0:12:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:12:35):**  and really rewarding when you actually do get a good harvest and, you know, and just  
**[0:12:40-0:12:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:12:40):**  to have the reward of knowing that you've sequestered.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:12:43):**  We're in the nori pilot program.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:12:46):**  So I think very highly of that group.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:12:48):**  They, if you input all of our data, which I've done with the help of the team at Mad  
**[0:12:52-0:12:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:12:52):**  Agriculture into Comet Farm, we've sequestered several thousand metric tons of CO2 equivalent  
**[0:12:59-0:13:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:12:59):**  out at our little farm.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:13:00):**  So that's what gives me hope is that that this is a scalable solution and it's just,  
**[0:13:05-0:13:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:13:05):**  it's a bit of a paradigm shift, but the opportunity across just the US of transitioning just corn  
**[0:13:12-0:13:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:13:12):**  and soybean acres to a different methodology of farming is very hopeful.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:13:17):**  So how, because you could have kept doing that, buying more farms or working with more  
**[0:13:22-0:13:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:13:22):**  farms, raising maybe a fund to invest in farms and to in that way contribute to the transition  
**[0:13:29-0:13:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:13:29):**  of many more hectares and acres, but you decided not to do that or maybe to do that as well  
**[0:13:34-0:13:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:13:34):**  as somewhere else.  
**[0:13:35-0:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:13:35):**  But in this case, do you help set up Trailhead Capital and focus on another piece of the  
**[0:13:39-0:13:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:13:39):**  region, Food and Ag ecosystem?  
**[0:13:42-0:13:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:13:42):**  Why and how did that come about?  
**[0:13:44-0:13:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:13:44):**  Yeah, great question.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:13:46):**  So concurrently I've kind of been doing some early stage investing through our family investment  
**[0:13:52-0:14:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:13:52):**  vehicle and I've kind of convinced myself over time that technology hasn't been particularly  
**[0:14:00-0:14:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:14:00):**  well applied to food and agriculture and started studying software, hardware, AI, machine learning  
**[0:14:07-0:14:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:14:07):**  opportunities in the space and ended up reconnecting with an old childhood family friend, Trip  
**[0:14:14-0:14:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:14:14):**  Wall, who had been speaking to Bobby Pells about kind of institutionalizing Trailhead  
**[0:14:20-0:14:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:14:20):**  Capital, which Bobby had started in 2017 as essentially kind of the venture arm of his  
**[0:14:25-0:14:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:14:25):**  personal family office.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:14:28):**  And so the three of us and Pete Oberle joined up and formed a general partnership and said,  
**[0:14:33-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:14:33):**  let's go out and raise a proper fund and do this the old fashioned way and get this to  
**[0:14:40-0:14:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:14:40):**  where it can be institutionally investable and apply, seek out seed in series A stage  
**[0:14:48-0:14:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:14:48):**  regenerative food and ag companies that we can verify that soil health is paramount and  
**[0:14:54-0:14:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:14:54):**  that soil health results from the activity, you know, the products and services of these  
**[0:14:58-0:15:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:14:58):**  companies.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:15:00):**  And that's what we've been up to for the last year.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:15:02):**  So we have made our first three investments into Telesense, Vents and Howgood.  
**[0:15:08-0:15:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:15:08):**  We had two out of three on the podcast.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:15:11):**  I will link them below for anybody.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:15:13):**  If you want to hear Ethan and Frank talk about Vents and Howgood, but walk us through those  
**[0:15:18-0:15:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:15:18):**  and how they connect to your investment thesis or to the different pillars, as I understood.  
**[0:15:24-0:15:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:15:24):**  Sure.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:15:25):**  So the three investment verticals are on farm, post farm gate or sort of supply chain and  
**[0:15:31-0:15:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:15:31):**  then consumer.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:15:32):**  So we're very methodically trying to invest across the entire supply chain of food and  
**[0:15:38-0:15:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:15:38):**  agriculture because our hope and our intention is that we build an ecosystem of portfolio  
**[0:15:44-0:15:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:15:44):**  companies that actually benefit one another.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:15:47):**  And we're already actually seeing that with a few of our initial portfolio companies.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:15:52):**  So within the producer category or on farm, that would be your Vents would fall into that  
**[0:15:58-0:15:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:15:58):**  category.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:15:59):**  So I actually heard some, I don't know if Frank would approve of this, but somebody  
**[0:16:03-0:16:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:16:03):**  was saying, Oh, Vents, that's like a remote controlled cow.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:16:07):**  And it's not exactly right, but yeah, you essentially put a collar around the cow and  
**[0:16:12-0:16:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:16:12):**  you can control their movement through GPS coordinates.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:16:16):**  Instead of electric fencing, just be clear.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:16:17):**  It's not that people say, Oh, but it's sad for, I mean, it's animal welfare, et cetera.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:16:22):**  But in terms of electric shock, they would get compared to touching a normal fence with  
**[0:16:27-0:16:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:16:27):**  their nose, just to be clear.  
**[0:16:29-0:16:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:16:29):**  It's also quite a step up from that.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:16:31):**  And of course it unlocks an enormous amount of potential.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:16:35):**  I had a very interesting discussion with Frank on the commons, but also the amount of land  
**[0:16:38-0:16:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:16:38):**  you can manage and the amount of wildlife that gets stuck in fencing at the moment.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:16:42):**  Like if you remove thousands, a hundreds of thousands of kilometers of fencing, emerging  
**[0:16:47-0:16:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:16:47):**  barbed wire, the amount of animals that get stuck in there because we want to keep a cow  
**[0:16:52-0:16:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:16:52):**  into a certain place and grazing it not properly, let's be honest there as well.  
**[0:16:56-0:16:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:16:56):**  It's quite mind boggling if you start thinking about it.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:16:59):**  Well, and it's actually a Pavlovian signal.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:17:02):**  So the cows get several sound signals before, as they're approaching the virtual fence.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:17:08):**  And then yeah, if you're wildlife and you don't have the collar around your neck, there's  
**[0:17:12-0:17:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:17:12):**  no fence there.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:17:13):**  So for wildlife corridors, I mean, one of our co-investors is the Nature Conservancy  
**[0:17:18-0:17:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:17:18):**  and that's one of the reasons that they love it.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:17:20):**  And yes, this is a, we think a gateway drug to convert many, many more ranchers to holistic  
**[0:17:29-0:17:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:17:29):**  management, multi-paddock, rotational intensive grazing methodologies, which mimics the predator  
**[0:17:36-0:17:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:17:36):**  prey relationship that built the topsoil in the first place.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:17:39):**  Yeah, let's, I mean, it's something to keep repeating.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:17:43):**  Almost every paddock you see or most every cow or even ruminants in general you see will  
**[0:17:49-0:17:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:17:49):**  be grazing, will be over grazing and under stocked.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:17:51):**  If you look at the land, it's very counterintuitive.  
**[0:17:53-0:17:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:17:53):**  Go deep into the science of grazing, you will find a world to understand, but I can guarantee  
**[0:17:58-0:18:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:17:58):**  you almost any animal you see grazing, ruminant, is on a farm or is in a field and is over  
**[0:18:03-0:18:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:18:03):**  grazing that field and is probably under stocked.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:18:06):**  And that's missing an enormous, that's first of all, damaging the climate and that's missing  
**[0:18:10-0:18:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:18:10):**  an enormous opportunity to restore soils and rebuild soils in a very different way and  
**[0:18:15-0:18:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:18:15):**  produce a lot more food because stock density can go way up if we do it well.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:18:18):**  Right.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:18:19):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:18:20):**  One of our principles is follow the intelligence of nature.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:18:23):**  And back in the day, bison used to go in, you know, they would roam in herds of thousands,  
**[0:18:28-0:18:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:18:28):**  tens of thousands, tight bunches to protect themselves from predators.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:18:33):**  And yeah, you eat, they would eat a little bit of the grass.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:18:36):**  Anywhere actually, Northern Africa was, I mean, the amount of deer that records show  
**[0:18:41-0:18:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:18:41):**  when the Romans went hunting there, like in a weekend, they shot 3000 or something.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:18:45):**  Just to be able to have that means the number of animals we cannot even imagine were roaming  
**[0:18:50-0:18:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:18:50):**  the different planes of this world.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:18:52):**  Fascinating.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:18:53):**  Okay.  
**[0:18:54-0:18:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:18:54):**  So that's a, I can see the connection to soil regeneration and tell us, it's much more on  
**[0:18:59-0:19:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:18:59):**  the food waste side, if I understand right.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:19:02):**  Right.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:19:03):**  So this is an internet of things, hardware device, a probe and an orb that you can actually  
**[0:19:07-0:19:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:19:07):**  stick into a grain bin or a barge of corn or wheat or soybeans.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:19:14):**  And it gives you real time atmospheric data and actually uses artificial intelligence  
**[0:19:18-0:19:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:19:18):**  and machine learning to predict grain quality along the supply chain.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:19:23):**  Don't quote me on this, but something like 30% or a large percentage of food waste actually  
**[0:19:29-0:19:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:19:29):**  happened between harvest and processing.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:19:32):**  So just in the storage and transport of the raw commodity, there's times where soybeans  
**[0:19:36-0:19:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:19:36):**  between Brazil and China, you know, an entire barge goes rancid.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:19:41):**  And you think about all of the sunshine and water and labor and fertilizer and chemicals  
**[0:19:48-0:19:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:19:48):**  inputs.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:19:49):**  Yeah.  
**[0:19:50-0:19:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:19:50):**  It's so reducing that shrinkage is, you know, we think a regenerative play and, you know,  
**[0:19:56-0:20:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:19:56):**  draw down all Hawkins update, you know, now shows food waste as perhaps the, you know,  
**[0:20:01-0:20:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:20:01):**  the greatest strategy to fighting climate change that we have and kind of low hanging  
**[0:20:06-0:20:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:20:06):**  fruit, so to speak.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:20:07):**  So we, yeah.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:20:08):**  Telesense is a actually an investment that my partner, Bobby Pell's made back in 2018  
**[0:20:14-0:20:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:20:14):**  in their series A round and he's contributing his, that, that at his cost basis into our fund.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:20:20):**  So that's a nice little step up for our limited partners in the fund.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:20:24):**  And he was invited onto the advisory board, has helped source several of the largest clients  
**[0:20:29-0:20:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:20:29):**  or customers of the Telesense technology.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:20:33):**  And yeah, really excited about where that company is going.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:20:36):**  And then the third one is how good and yeah, Ethan's been on the show multiple times.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:20:42):**  So I don't need to rehash that one, but really exciting transparency and traceability for  
**[0:20:50-0:20:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:20:50):**  food ingredients to actually drill down into what are the greenhouse gases, the total water  
**[0:20:56-0:21:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:20:56):**  usage, the animal welfare components, the social welfare farmer dignity components and  
**[0:21:03-0:21:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:21:03):**  biodiversity.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:21:04):**  I mean, how do we start drilling down into, you know, it's essentially a life cycle assessment  
**[0:21:09-0:21:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:21:09):**  alternative in a way to understanding what are the, all of the environmental and social  
**[0:21:16-0:21:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:21:16):**  implications of particular ingredient in a consumer packaged good, granola bar or oat  
**[0:21:23-0:21:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:21:23):**  milk or whatever it is.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:21:25):**  And so are those the three verticals?  
**[0:21:27-0:21:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:21:27):**  It's pretty nicely mapped.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:21:30):**  What are you missing in the space?  
**[0:21:32-0:21:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:21:32):**  I mean, there's so much happening.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:21:33):**  There seems so much hype around region ag and so et cetera, but you obviously are looking  
**[0:21:38-0:21:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:21:38):**  at many, many different deals.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:21:40):**  People listening.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:21:42):**  What are the gaps you see so far?  
**[0:21:43-0:21:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:21:43):**  What are things you would love to see?  
**[0:21:45-0:21:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:21:45):**  Because I understand you could probably not talk too much about the things you're currently  
**[0:21:48-0:21:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:21:48):**  seeing because you might be in some negotiations and we have to check in in six months or a  
**[0:21:51-0:21:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:21:51):**  year about what are the things you would love to see over the next six months or would love  
**[0:21:55-0:21:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:21:55):**  to see people building and get to a series a at some point.  
**[0:21:58-0:21:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:21:58):**  Great question.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:21:59):**  Well, the only vertical we haven't yet covered is the consumer vertical.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:22:03):**  Of course.  
**[0:22:04-0:22:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:22:04):**  Yeah.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:22:05):**  But how good, I mean, touches that for sure.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:22:07):**  It's not the consumer vertical, but when a consumer vertical, you mean much more really  
**[0:22:11-0:22:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:22:11):**  literally get something into the house or into the home of consumers of everyday people.  
**[0:22:16-0:22:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:22:16):**  That's right.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:22:17):**  Yep.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:22:18):**  And we have a partnership with the Rodale Institute, who is the architect of, along  
**[0:22:21-0:22:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:22:21):**  with Patagonia and Dr. Bronner's of the regenerative organic certification scheme.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:22:26):**  And we're getting an early look at companies, you know, CPG companies that are attaining  
**[0:22:30-0:22:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:22:30):**  ROC bronze, silver, gold.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:22:33):**  So you're going to literally invest in food companies.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:22:35):**  Is that very different from a technology company like Fence?  
**[0:22:38-0:22:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:22:38):**  I mean, it is, but do you see that fitting in the same fund and investment strategy?  
**[0:22:43-0:22:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:22:43):**  We do.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:22:44):**  And we are unusual in that sense, but we think that's part of the ecosystem play.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:22:48):**  We think is that it's important to actually have portfolio companies that touch the consumer.  
**[0:22:53-0:22:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:22:53):**  So hopefully we don't have to edit this out, but we're about to invest in white leaf provisions,  
**[0:22:59-0:23:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:22:59):**  which is a Demeter certified biodynamic.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:23:01):**  They were in the show as well.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:23:03):**  We had them on, I'm thinking December, but I might be wrong.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:23:06):**  I might be eating my words, but a few months ago.  
**[0:23:09-0:23:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:23:09):**  Yeah.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:23:10):**  Megan and Keith are doing an amazing job and we think there's a really exciting future  
**[0:23:13-0:23:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:23:13):**  for that company.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:23:15):**  And they are really dedicated to soil health and regenerative practices and telling that  
**[0:23:22-0:23:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:23:22):**  story and communicating those benefits to the consumer.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:23:26):**  We think starting with the baby food category is a no brainer because we have a three and  
**[0:23:31-0:23:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:23:31):**  a half year old and a one and a half year old.  
**[0:23:33-0:23:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:23:33):**  And I'm much more militant about what I put in their bodies than what I do even in my  
**[0:23:37-0:23:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:23:37):**  own.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:23:38):**  I still remember Greg of Farmland LP saying organic milk is the gateway drug to anything  
**[0:23:44-0:23:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:23:44):**  else because as soon as you start with that with small children, babies, et cetera, then  
**[0:23:49-0:23:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:23:49):**  the rest follows because yeah, it's really such a, and I see it in my environment as  
**[0:23:55-0:23:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:23:55):**  well.  
**[0:23:56-0:23:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:23:56):**  It's such a life changing moment.  
**[0:23:57-0:24:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:23:57):**  And even if you were paying attention before, suddenly you turn it up a notch when you have  
**[0:24:02-0:24:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:24:02):**  to feed your children or your child.  
**[0:24:05-0:24:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:24:05):**  Yeah.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:24:06):**  And there was here in the US, there was a recent Senate subcommittee report pointing  
**[0:24:10-0:24:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:24:10):**  out unsafe levels of heavy metals in baby foods and even several organic baby food brands.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:24:17):**  And Whiteleaf has tested well below those levels largely because they get the major  
**[0:24:22-0:24:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:24:22):**  stuff in Europe, right?  
**[0:24:23-0:24:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:24:23):**  Yeah.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:24:24):**  That's the ingredients come from.  
**[0:24:25-0:24:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:24:25):**  Exactly.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:24:26):**  And they have pristine soils and practices.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:24:29):**  So I mean, we think the enlightened consumer moving forward is going to pay more and more  
**[0:24:36-0:24:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:24:36):**  attention to make sure there's not lead and cadmium and arsenic in their baby food or  
**[0:24:41-0:24:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:24:41):**  any of their food.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:24:42):**  So we think Whiteleaf Provisions has a really exciting brand and competitive advantage moving  
**[0:24:48-0:24:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:24:48):**  forward.  
**[0:24:49-0:24:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:24:49):**  Their direct consumer sales are up something like 1700% since that Senate subcommittee  
**[0:24:53-0:24:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:24:53):**  report came out.  
**[0:24:54-0:24:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:24:54):**  Which could also be that they started really small, but yeah, it's still an impressive  
**[0:24:58-0:24:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:24:58):**  number.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:24:59):**  They did start small.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:25:00):**  Yes.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:25:01):**  But we think that trajectory continues.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:25:03):**  And again, transparency and traceability.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:25:06):**  We just think more and more consumers are waking up to the notion that you are what  
**[0:25:12-0:25:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:25:12):**  you eat and you are what you eat eats and your health is inextricably linked to what  
**[0:25:18-0:25:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:25:18):**  you eat.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:25:20):**  And there's room for improvement in the average American diet.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:25:25):**  That's for sure.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:25:26):**  And so to come back to the question of what do you miss?  
**[0:25:29-0:25:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:25:29):**  What are big spots?  
**[0:25:30-0:25:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:25:30):**  I mean, you've sort of covered if you signed this one, all verticals or all pieces, but  
**[0:25:35-0:25:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:25:35):**  that doesn't mean you're done, obviously, because you're hoping to raise, I think, 50  
**[0:25:38-0:25:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:25:38):**  million five zero.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:25:39):**  And that means quite a few investments.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:25:41):**  What is it that you're not seeing enough of?  
**[0:25:43-0:25:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:25:43):**  Yeah, we hope to get to 25 to 30 investments total.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:25:47):**  Honestly, the whole carbon monitoring, carbon monetization world is exciting.  
**[0:25:54-0:25:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:25:54):**  And I've been singing from that song sheet for many years.  
**[0:25:57-0:26:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:25:57):**  But it's now there's some of us that are a little concerned that now the policy in the  
**[0:26:02-0:26:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:26:02):**  markets might be getting a little bit ahead of the science.  
**[0:26:04-0:26:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:26:04):**  So I would love to see.  
**[0:26:06-0:26:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:26:06):**  I mean, there's some really exciting companies out there that are doing remote sensing and  
**[0:26:10-0:26:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:26:10):**  that are getting closer and closer to being able to point a sensor at some ground and  
**[0:26:15-0:26:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:26:15):**  get carbon reading from that.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:26:18):**  Same thing with nutrient density, if and when we can have more instantaneous and really  
**[0:26:23-0:26:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:26:23):**  reliable data on here's the carbon content of this soil or here's the nutrient density  
**[0:26:28-0:26:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:26:28):**  of this kale.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:26:31):**  Coming back to your transparency question.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:26:33):**  Yeah, now there's exciting stuff happening there for sure.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:26:36):**  But it's for sure.  
**[0:26:37-0:26:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:26:37):**  Yeah, it's I mean, the carbon piece is definitely going up the hype cycle.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:26:43):**  And I mean, we've done a few interviews there, but it's very overwhelming.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:26:47):**  And there's a lot of promising and for sure, we're going to see some scandals on the nutrient  
**[0:26:52-0:26:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:26:52):**  density.  
**[0:26:53-0:26:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:26:53):**  I mean, there simply isn't a lot.  
**[0:26:55-0:27:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:26:55):**  I was just on a call before here on a conference actually of Pierre wheel and Blanc in France  
**[0:27:00-0:27:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:27:00):**  during their one health conference focusing a lot on inflammatory disease, COVID and others  
**[0:27:06-0:27:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:27:06):**  and the role of omega three and omega six and the role of animal health and role of  
**[0:27:10-0:27:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:27:10):**  soil.  
**[0:27:11-0:27:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:27:11):**  And it's interesting how little we talk about it.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:27:14):**  Of course, the then Kittrich's and the bio nutrient food association, but that's not  
**[0:27:18-0:27:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:27:18):**  an investable thing yet.  
**[0:27:20-0:27:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:27:20):**  And there are others and there's a lot of things floating around it.  
**[0:27:23-0:27:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:27:23):**  But the real core question, what is this carrot?  
**[0:27:25-0:27:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:27:25):**  What is that carrot is still it feels like we're earlier in that but I am convinced that  
**[0:27:30-0:27:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:27:30):**  in five years, we'll have a very different discussion on this topic.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:27:33):**  And it's definitely exciting.  
**[0:27:34-0:27:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:27:34):**  I hope it still falls in your investment period, or maybe it will be your second fund.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:27:39):**  Maybe that's fun, too.  
**[0:27:40-0:27:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:27:40):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:27:41):**  And also, I mean, the science around the rhizosphere and how the more we're learning now about  
**[0:27:48-0:27:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:27:48):**  how plant roots and mycorrhizal fungi and the microbial community all interact.  
**[0:27:55-0:28:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:27:55):**  And I think as that science continues to advance, hopefully there are some companies and technologies  
**[0:28:01-0:28:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:28:01):**  or biologically inoculated seeds or something along those lines that come from those scientific  
**[0:28:08-0:28:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:28:08):**  advancements as well.  
**[0:28:09-0:28:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:28:09):**  Because I think we're just starting to scratch the surface of how soil actually functions.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:28:14):**  And the more we understand that, I think the more we can move away from subsidizing the  
**[0:28:20-0:28:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:28:20):**  conventional activity and move toward actually incentivizing farmers to care for the soil.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:28:26):**  Yeah, it's quite shocking how little we know and how often now, especially in the last  
**[0:28:32-0:28:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:28:32):**  years, research comes out that completely shocks, let's say, conventional or the general  
**[0:28:37-0:28:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:28:37):**  public.  
**[0:28:38-0:28:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:28:38):**  And then when you look at what Alain Ingham was doing 15 years ago, I mean, a lot of it  
**[0:28:42-0:28:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:28:42):**  was already known, maybe not just in 15 peer review papers, but it is really, it feels  
**[0:28:47-0:28:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:28:47):**  so early and so exciting, but it also means how are we going to build companies on that  
**[0:28:52-0:28:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:28:52):**  or how are you going to build something on it that actually contributes and not just  
**[0:28:56-0:29:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:28:56):**  some dead end or something we discover in two years that completely changes the direction  
**[0:29:01-0:29:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:29:01):**  of the mycorrhizal community and focus.  
**[0:29:03-0:29:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:29:03):**  So it's very exciting, but yeah, it's very tricky compared to the food brand space, et  
**[0:29:08-0:29:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:29:08):**  cetera.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:29:09):**  I mean, we know how biodynamic is functioning.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:29:10):**  We know how it's growing, et cetera.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:29:12):**  I mean, it's a very different beast, but not meaning it's less interesting.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:29:16):**  Right.  
**[0:29:17-0:29:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:29:17):**  Again, I mean, to go back to another analogy, I mean, most people thought the internal combustion  
**[0:29:23-0:29:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:29:23):**  engine was, that was the apex.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:29:25):**  That was how mobility was going to happen.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:29:28):**  And now the lithium ion battery and electric vehicles make the internal combustion engine  
**[0:29:34-0:29:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:29:34):**  look antiquated.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:29:35):**  Oh, absolutely.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:29:36):**  We rented an electric car over the last weeks and a very simple Zoe.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:29:41):**  And then you go back to a petrol one and you really think, ah, yeah, that's why we didn't  
**[0:29:45-0:29:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:29:45):**  do this.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:29:46):**  This was a good reason.  
**[0:29:47-0:29:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:29:47):**  Like, ah, yeah, no, it makes a lot of noise and it's not smooth at all.  
**[0:29:50-0:29:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:29:50):**  And it's this and that.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:29:51):**  And, but it took 15, 20 years.  
**[0:29:53-0:29:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:29:53):**  I mean, I remember the first things.  
**[0:29:54-0:29:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:29:54):**  I remember the smallest car in Europe that were electric because of the battery size.  
**[0:29:59-0:30:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:29:59):**  And it really took a long way before you could buy your Kia or Hyundai or Volkswagen ID3.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:30:04):**  And of course, Tesla, because it's technology.  
**[0:30:07-0:30:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:30:07):**  Why?  
**[0:30:08-0:30:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:30:08):**  I mean, in this case, I think it's a long road because it's implementing across many  
**[0:30:10-0:30:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:30:10):**  hectares and acres, but I hope we go faster.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:30:14):**  Right.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:30:15):**  But if there's an equivalent to the Tesla for say, replacing synthetic nitrogen fertilizer,  
**[0:30:22-0:30:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:30:22):**  and we find something, whether it's pivot bio or cooler bio or nitricity or lots of  
**[0:30:28-0:30:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:30:28):**  exciting companies in the space that kind of can make the internal combustion engine  
**[0:30:32-0:30:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:30:32):**  look silly and, or make synthetic nitrogen fertilizer look really wasteful.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:30:37):**  And first thing we've got to do is start to price some of the externalities associated  
**[0:30:41-0:30:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:30:41):**  with that, which was, I mean, that was what I wrote my economic senior thesis on was we  
**[0:30:46-0:30:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:30:46):**  need a gasoline tax to price all of the harmful externalities associated with fossil fuels.  
**[0:30:53-0:30:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:30:53):**  Same thing with synthetic nitrogen fertilizer.  
**[0:30:55-0:31:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:30:55):**  I mean, if you actually priced in all of the harm that comes from that, yes, it has done  
**[0:31:00-0:31:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:31:00):**  a service of sorts to humanity and fed many, many people, but there are negative consequences  
**[0:31:07-0:31:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:31:07):**  to all that as well, such as the dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:31:12-0:31:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:31:12):**  So that's where we're hoping we can place capital is with entrepreneurs and companies  
**[0:31:17-0:31:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:31:17):**  that are creating the lithium ion battery equivalent of what's next.  
**[0:31:23-0:31:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:31:23):**  How else can you fix nitrogen and have plants thrive without all of the negative externalities?  
**[0:31:30-0:31:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:31:30):**  And do you see there a role, cause I'm always interested, not necessarily worried, but you  
**[0:31:35-0:31:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:31:35):**  see the main, let's say proponents of a healthy soil say at some point your soil is that healthy  
**[0:31:40-0:31:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:31:40):**  that you don't need even like you've replaced the input, like, okay, it's artificial or  
**[0:31:45-0:31:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:31:45):**  it's chemical nitrogen.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:31:46):**  And now you're doing some kind of other solution that's maybe producing a completely sustainable  
**[0:31:50-0:31:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:31:50):**  or let's say net zero way, but still you potentially have that impact on the soil, the negative  
**[0:31:55-0:31:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:31:55):**  impact on the soils that potentially risky.  
**[0:31:58-0:32:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:31:58):**  Or is there, should it always be in that path of transition?  
**[0:32:01-0:32:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:32:01):**  Like at some point in 10, 15, 20 years, depending on your soil, you don't need that amount of  
**[0:32:06-0:32:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:32:06):**  input anymore.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:32:07):**  You maybe need it every five years.  
**[0:32:08-0:32:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:32:08):**  Is that company sort of going to make itself obsolete?  
**[0:32:11-0:32:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:32:11):**  Is that your hope or how does it work?  
**[0:32:13-0:32:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:32:13):**  You don't want to replace the input dependency for another input, which is way more sustainable.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:32:17):**  I'm very happy for the carbon footprint of it, but it's still an input dependency.  
**[0:32:21-0:32:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:32:21):**  Great question.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:32:22):**  Huge, huge question.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:32:23):**  I think there is an argument for some of these companies working themselves out of future  
**[0:32:29-0:32:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:32:29):**  revenues.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:32:30):**  Again, getting back to a guy named Herman Daly wrote a book called Beyond Growth and  
**[0:32:36-0:32:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:32:36):**  there are certain arguments for sure for what some people call a steady state economy.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:32:40):**  And until then we have a lot of hectares to do and acres to do.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:32:43):**  Like it's not that it's, there's a, I'm not saying it's a near term problem, but it's  
**[0:32:48-0:32:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:32:48):**  an interesting thing to think about.  
**[0:32:49-0:32:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:32:49):**  Like do you replace one input with something else?  
**[0:32:51-0:32:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:32:51):**  Exactly.  
**[0:32:52-0:32:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:32:52):**  Yeah.  
**[0:32:53-0:32:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:32:53):**  And I think the final part of my career might be exploring some post-capitalistic paradigms  
**[0:32:57-0:33:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:32:57):**  because I do come back to, we live on a planet with finite natural resources and we have  
**[0:33:03-0:33:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:33:03):**  an economic system predicated on infinite growth.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:33:06):**  Yeah.  
**[0:33:07-0:33:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:33:07):**  And what is a natural forest grows about, what is it?  
**[0:33:09-0:33:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:33:09):**  3.6 or 3.7 I heard a quote somewhere, a percent a year.  
**[0:33:12-0:33:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:33:12):**  That's pretty much the maximum growth we potentially could do.  
**[0:33:15-0:33:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:33:15):**  Of course there's a lot of degraded land and degraded farmland and underproductive, et  
**[0:33:20-0:33:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:33:20):**  cetera.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:33:21):**  And there's a plato, which is the same argument we always have on carbon, but they always  
**[0:33:24-0:33:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:33:24):**  put those very quickly.  
**[0:33:25-0:33:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:33:25):**  Yeah.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:33:26):**  But it's also, we have a lot of space left in the bank to store carbon.  
**[0:33:29-0:33:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:33:29):**  It might plateau at some point, which is not necessarily a bad thing.  
**[0:33:32-0:33:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:33:32):**  So either innovation has to continue to outpace and use resources more and more efficiently,  
**[0:33:39-0:33:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:33:39):**  which is possible.  
**[0:33:40-0:33:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:33:40):**  And that's kind of a bet we're making with Trailhead.  
**[0:33:41-0:33:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:33:41):**  And I think that's a good bet for this moment in time is to say there are major resource  
**[0:33:48-0:33:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:33:48):**  efficiency improvements to be made, waste reductions to be made.  
**[0:33:53-0:34:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:33:53):**  But yeah, ultimately does a truly regenerative future allow for the current manifestation  
**[0:34:00-0:34:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:34:00):**  of global markets and capitalism?  
**[0:34:02-0:34:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:34:02):**  I'm not sure.  
**[0:34:03-0:34:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:34:03):**  And returns.  
**[0:34:04-0:34:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:34:04):**  Yeah.  
**[0:34:05-0:34:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:34:05):**  Yeah.  
**[0:34:06-0:34:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:34:06):**  Well, in the near term, I mean, I think there's so much opportunity to just do things better  
**[0:34:10-0:34:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:34:10):**  and there's so much waste and so much just bad subsidies.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:34:15):**  We're incentivizing the wrong behavior through our government actions.  
**[0:34:19-0:34:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:34:19):**  And coming back to that point, maybe it's a different answer you want to give there.  
**[0:34:24-0:34:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:34:24):**  I always like to ask the question, if you had a magic wand and you could change one  
**[0:34:27-0:34:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:34:27):**  thing, what would that be in the icon food space?  
**[0:34:29-0:34:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:34:29):**  In your case, would that be the incentivization and pricing, true pricing, true cost accounting,  
**[0:34:35-0:34:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:34:35):**  et cetera?  
**[0:34:36-0:34:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:34:36):**  Or do you have something completely different?  
**[0:34:37-0:34:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:34:37):**  Like, I don't know, change the taste buds of everyone and taste the real ingredients  
**[0:34:40-0:34:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:34:40):**  or something like that.  
**[0:34:42-0:34:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:34:42):**  Whatever you feel obviously appropriate here.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:34:44):**  What would be that one thing if you had a magic wand and that power?  
**[0:34:48-0:34:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:34:48):**  I think my magic wand would probably be to price externalities and to stop subsidizing.  
**[0:34:55-0:35:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:34:55):**  The way in which our financing mechanisms and insurance mechanisms are designed around  
**[0:35:01-0:35:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:35:01):**  a high input monocultures of largely corn and soybeans is infuriating.  
**[0:35:08-0:35:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:35:08):**  And if you just stopped, it's the same again, kind of going back to fossil fuels and we  
**[0:35:13-0:35:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:35:13):**  subsidized oil and gas and coal industries through taxpayer dollars for decades.  
**[0:35:20-0:35:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:35:20):**  And if I would get into all these debates with my dad and his buddies of solar and wind  
**[0:35:26-0:35:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:35:26):**  require subsidies and you need to be able to compete in the open market.  
**[0:35:30-0:35:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:35:30):**  I mean, the free market in the energy world and in the food and ag world isn't real.  
**[0:35:35-0:35:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:35:35):**  I mean, everything that the existing system is highly, highly subsidized.  
**[0:35:41-0:35:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:35:41):**  And I think a lesson to be learned from the energy transition is yes, you have to create  
**[0:35:48-0:35:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:35:48):**  feed-in tariffs and production tax credits and investment tax credits.  
**[0:35:52-0:35:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:35:52):**  But also a huge first step is to just stop subsidizing the broken system.  
**[0:35:58-0:36:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:35:58):**  Which we haven't done in the fossil fuel.  
**[0:36:00-0:36:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:36:00):**  We subsidize with a few billion here and there.  
**[0:36:03-0:36:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:36:03):**  These new guys and girls without having the uncomfortable questions, why are tens of billions  
**[0:36:08-0:36:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:36:08):**  every year, probably hundreds of billions going towards the fossil fuel industry?  
**[0:36:12-0:36:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:36:12):**  And that's still going on and they are still losing money at the moment.  
**[0:36:16-0:36:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:36:16):**  So it's that uncomfortable question.  
**[0:36:18-0:36:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:36:18):**  It was much easier to support something positive than to deal with the negative part.  
**[0:36:22-0:36:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:36:22):**  And we should learn from that, but it's not going to be an easy conversation unless we  
**[0:36:25-0:36:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:36:25):**  sue them probably.  
**[0:36:26-0:36:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:36:26):**  Well, the other fun thing about food and agriculture is that unlike renewable energy or traditional  
**[0:36:32-0:36:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:36:32):**  energy, it can be delicious and you can create community around it.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:36:36):**  I mean, that was one of the things I didn't love about being in the energy world is electrons  
**[0:36:41-0:36:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:36:41):**  are hard to build community around.  
**[0:36:43-0:36:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:36:43):**  They do it with, I mean, the co-op movement, obviously.  
**[0:36:46-0:36:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:36:46):**  I mean, especially renewable energy, but then yeah, it doesn't change.  
**[0:36:49-0:36:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:36:49):**  I mean, if I switch on this light bulb or the computer, it doesn't change a second.  
**[0:36:54-0:36:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:36:54):**  Just my feeling if this is coming from a coal plant far away or from a solar panel on my  
**[0:36:58-0:36:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:36:58):**  roof.  
**[0:36:59-0:37:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:36:59):**  Yeah, you're absolutely right.  
**[0:37:00-0:37:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:37:00):**  It's a very different, that's why I'm very hopeful of impact consumers can have, especially  
**[0:37:05-0:37:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:37:05):**  when nutrient density starts becoming more transparent, et cetera, because it's delicious  
**[0:37:10-0:37:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:37:10):**  and potentially a lot better for you.  
**[0:37:12-0:37:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:37:12):**  We have the opportunity to break bread three times a day and build community and recognize  
**[0:37:18-0:37:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:37:18):**  that we feel better if we eat this food versus that food and our body and our mind and our  
**[0:37:24-0:37:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:37:24):**  spirit functions at a higher level.  
**[0:37:27-0:37:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:37:27):**  That's what I'm excited about with food and agriculture.  
**[0:37:29-0:37:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:37:29):**  And I think it can put as big of a dent, if not bigger in the climate crisis as energy  
**[0:37:36-0:37:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:37:36):**  or the built environment or transportation.  
**[0:37:39-0:37:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:37:39):**  I mean, food and agriculture accounts for roughly a quarter of global greenhouse gas  
**[0:37:45-0:37:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:37:45):**  emissions.  
**[0:37:46-0:37:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:37:46):**  So it's a big piece of the pie to be tackling.  
**[0:37:49-0:37:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:37:49):**  So that's where we think there have been more advancements in the built environment, in  
**[0:37:54-0:37:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:37:54):**  the transportation sector, in the energy sector.  
**[0:37:57-0:38:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:37:57):**  We think it's time to shine a light on improving the greenhouse gas profile of the current  
**[0:38:04-0:38:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:38:04):**  global paradigm in food and agriculture.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:38:07):**  So why with all due respect, such a small fund, like why aiming for 50 million?  
**[0:38:13-0:38:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:38:13):**  And it's a question I always like to ask what would happen if you have control over, let's  
**[0:38:16-0:38:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:38:16):**  say a billion, let's say a lot of money in terms of investing.  
**[0:38:19-0:38:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:38:19):**  Is it because potentially investor interest, is there not enough deal flow or not enough?  
**[0:38:25-0:38:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:38:25):**  Is there not enough quality to flow?  
**[0:38:27-0:38:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:38:27):**  Is it a mix of things?  
**[0:38:28-0:38:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:38:28):**  What is the reason?  
**[0:38:29-0:38:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:38:29):**  I mean, 50 million, it's a lot of money.  
**[0:38:31-0:38:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:38:31):**  It's absolutely not easy to raise it, but it's also in terms of the grand scheme of  
**[0:38:35-0:38:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:38:35):**  things of the food and agriculture sector, it's a drop in the bucket.  
**[0:38:38-0:38:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:38:38):**  Like it's very, very small.  
**[0:38:40-0:38:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:38:40):**  And I understand the acupuncture effect of a few investments, very specific investments  
**[0:38:45-0:38:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:38:45):**  here and there.  
**[0:38:46-0:38:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:38:46):**  What made you choose to not go for a half a billion or more?  
**[0:38:49-0:38:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:38:49):**  And then I'll ask the question, what would you do if you had access to that?  
**[0:38:52-0:38:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:38:52):**  Yeah, our intention is to have over a billion of assets under management at Trailhead Capital  
**[0:38:57-0:39:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:38:57):**  in the next several years under various strategies.  
**[0:39:01-0:39:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:39:01):**  We think we will have a series of thematic funds centered around regenerative agriculture,  
**[0:39:06-0:39:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:39:06):**  but we're looking at, you know, fund two could be an infrastructure based fund or real asset  
**[0:39:12-0:39:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:39:12):**  fund or more growth equity strategy.  
**[0:39:16-0:39:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:39:16):**  But we thought long and hard about how do we come out of the gates?  
**[0:39:19-0:39:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:39:19):**  And we think we're in the first inning of regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:39:23-0:39:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:39:23):**  So now's a good time to do seed and series A investing and place bets.  
**[0:39:27-0:39:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:39:27):**  Do you see that?  
**[0:39:28-0:39:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:39:28):**  Like, is there a lot of deal flow in that space and do you have a lot of competition?  
**[0:39:33-0:39:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:39:33):**  Like is it because the hype is going, people are starting to say all kinds of things about  
**[0:39:37-0:39:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:39:37):**  investing in this space.  
**[0:39:38-0:39:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:39:38):**  We see that in the podcast, obviously.  
**[0:39:39-0:39:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:39:39):**  Like, do you have to work your way into the use or is it still okayish to do?  
**[0:39:45-0:39:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:39:45):**  Yeah, over the last nine months, we've looked at 481 distinct investment opportunities.  
**[0:39:52-0:39:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:39:52):**  Like just to be clear, US, Australia, mostly, right?  
**[0:39:55-0:40:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:39:55):**  That's your US, Canada, Australia and Israel are our four geographic focus areas here in  
**[0:40:01-0:40:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:40:01):**  fund one.  
**[0:40:02-0:40:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:40:02):**  So 400 pluses a lot.  
**[0:40:04-0:40:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:40:04):**  Yeah.  
**[0:40:05-0:40:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:40:05):**  I mean, so we think that's pretty good deal flow and you know, 126 of those sort of moved  
**[0:40:10-0:40:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:40:10):**  into the next stage of diligence and 14 of those are in various stages of advanced due  
**[0:40:17-0:40:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:40:17):**  diligence.  
**[0:40:18-0:40:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:40:18):**  Three investments made, two more committed.  
**[0:40:21-0:40:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:40:21):**  We feel like that's a pretty good filter and a healthy amount of deal flow and a healthy  
**[0:40:26-0:40:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:40:26):**  amount of opportunities that we're passing on.  
**[0:40:28-0:40:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:40:28):**  And yes, the best deals as in any valuations, get out of control and or it's, you have to  
**[0:40:37-0:40:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:40:37):**  prove to the entrepreneur and the company that they should take your check and not somebody  
**[0:40:41-0:40:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:40:41):**  else's.  
**[0:40:42-0:40:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:40:42):**  And we've been very fortunate thus far to have been invited into several of these rounds  
**[0:40:47-0:40:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:40:47):**  because of the perceived benefit of our network, our subject matter expertise.  
**[0:40:52-0:40:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:40:52):**  And we've actually been delighted that they've taken our investment and in some cases over  
**[0:40:58-0:41:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:40:58):**  some big name Silicon Valley shops because those groups are more generalists and don't  
**[0:41:04-0:41:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:41:04):**  have the on-farm experience, don't have the network that we do in this particular sector  
**[0:41:10-0:41:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:41:10):**  and thematic area.  
**[0:41:12-0:41:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:41:12):**  So what would you, okay, so I understand the logic of the 50 million if you get there obviously,  
**[0:41:17-0:41:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:41:17):**  but at least the logic of a number of tens of million investment fund and then potentially  
**[0:41:22-0:41:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:41:22):**  going to real estate, real assets, et cetera.  
**[0:41:24-0:41:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:41:24):**  So what if tomorrow morning you wake up and you have that billion under management or  
**[0:41:28-0:41:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:41:28):**  10 billion, what would you focus on now as you have to invest it, let's say over the  
**[0:41:32-0:41:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:41:32):**  next few years?  
**[0:41:33-0:41:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:41:33):**  It could be any range, it could be the time horizon is completely flexible, the returns  
**[0:41:38-0:41:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:41:38):**  as well, but they are investments.  
**[0:41:40-0:41:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:41:40):**  What would be your top priority list of things to put money to work?  
**[0:41:43-0:41:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:41:43):**  Yeah.  
**[0:41:44-0:41:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:41:44):**  I mean, just to put a finishing note on the previous question, I mean, 50 million is,  
**[0:41:48-0:41:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:41:48):**  goes pretty far when, cause our seed stage investments are only a couple hundred thousand  
**[0:41:53-0:41:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:41:53):**  dollars a piece.  
**[0:41:54-0:41:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:41:54):**  Series A stage investments are a couple million a piece.  
**[0:41:56-0:42:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:41:56):**  So 50 million stretches across 25 to 30 investments, which is statistically a good shot at having  
**[0:42:04-0:42:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:42:04):**  a couple of those, you know, B home runs that return the whole fund.  
**[0:42:08-0:42:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:42:08):**  I mean, that's kind of the venture capital game is.  
**[0:42:11-0:42:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:42:11):**  So it's a classic, relatively classic fund in that way, right?  
**[0:42:14-0:42:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:42:14):**  That's right.  
**[0:42:15-0:42:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:42:15):**  Yep.  
**[0:42:16-0:42:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:42:16):**  Ten year fund life will be investing over the first three to four years, two and 20  
**[0:42:19-0:42:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:42:19):**  model.  
**[0:42:20-0:42:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:42:20):**  We kind of thought about getting creative with how do we innovate around that structure.  
**[0:42:25-0:42:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:42:25):**  Oh, I've had this conversation so many times and every time, not every time, often it comes  
**[0:42:31-0:42:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:42:31):**  back to let's not innovate on too many things.  
**[0:42:33-0:42:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:42:33):**  Region egg and food is already quite a stretch for many investors.  
**[0:42:38-0:42:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:42:38):**  That's right.  
**[0:42:39-0:42:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:42:39):**  Yep.  
**[0:42:40-0:42:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:42:40):**  Yep.  
**[0:42:41-0:42:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:42:41):**  But yeah, if I had 10 billion tomorrow, I mean, I think, I don't know if I should just  
**[0:42:44-0:42:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:42:44):**  name specific companies, but I mean, I think.  
**[0:42:48-0:42:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:42:48):**  Whatever you feel comfortable.  
**[0:42:49-0:42:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:42:49):**  I don't want to put you in, but also it's pieces of the puzzle, places that you think  
**[0:42:54-0:42:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:42:54):**  that should really could be even a small part could be lobbying.  
**[0:42:56-0:42:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:42:56):**  I mean, feel free to open it up.  
**[0:42:59-0:43:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:42:59):**  I mean, some people see that as investments as well.  
**[0:43:01-0:43:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:43:01):**  And definitely we don't do that enough.  
**[0:43:03-0:43:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:43:03):**  Sure.  
**[0:43:04-0:43:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:43:04):**  Where would you put it?  
**[0:43:05-0:43:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:43:05):**  Oh, I think policy.  
**[0:43:06-0:43:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:43:06):**  I love the idea of putting some of that to work in, as we've talked about changing policy,  
**[0:43:12-0:43:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:43:12):**  stop incentivizing the bad activity and start putting, I mean, if we could put incentives,  
**[0:43:17-0:43:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:43:17):**  subsidies, tax credits towards regenerative practices, you know, pay farmers to cover  
**[0:43:24-0:43:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:43:24):**  crop, which actually is just now starting to happen here in the US pay farmers to move  
**[0:43:29-0:43:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:43:29):**  toward no-till methodologies, pay farmers to recouple animals and use livestock integration  
**[0:43:36-0:43:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:43:36):**  with their cropping systems.  
**[0:43:39-0:43:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:43:39):**  Or set up like an activist hedge fund or something and try to do the same as is happening with  
**[0:43:43-0:43:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:43:43):**  some fossil fuel majors to change board seats, et cetera.  
**[0:43:46-0:43:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:43:46):**  It would be an interesting investment as well.  
**[0:43:47-0:43:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:43:47):**  But sorry, you were going to name companies.  
**[0:43:48-0:43:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:43:48):**  I don't want to take you away from that.  
**[0:43:50-0:43:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:43:50):**  If you have not changed your mind, what would you do with 10 billion?  
**[0:43:53-0:44:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:43:53):**  I think you could say, let's recruit executives and leadership from other industries and put  
**[0:44:00-0:44:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:44:00):**  them to work in food and ag and say, you know, here's.  
**[0:44:03-0:44:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:44:03):**  Like the Theo mentorship, but then for regenerative ag.  
**[0:44:08-0:44:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:44:08):**  That's interesting.  
**[0:44:09-0:44:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:44:09):**  Yeah.  
**[0:44:10-0:44:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:44:10):**  Say here's, you know, put together a dream team, fund it with hundreds of millions of  
**[0:44:14-0:44:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:44:14):**  dollars and say, go solve this problem.  
**[0:44:17-0:44:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:44:17):**  Go solve the synthetic nitrogen fertilizer problem.  
**[0:44:20-0:44:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:44:20):**  Go solve the remote sensing carbon verification and measurement problem.  
**[0:44:26-0:44:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:44:26):**  Go solve the herbicide pesticide dependency problem through a couple hundred million dollars  
**[0:44:32-0:44:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:44:32):**  at Dan Kittredge and advance the ball substantially on understanding nutrient density in our food.  
**[0:44:40-0:44:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:44:40):**  Throw money.  
**[0:44:41-0:44:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:44:41):**  I mean, this wouldn't be as much of an investment opportunity, but at the scientific community  
**[0:44:45-0:44:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:44:45):**  and at researchers who better understand the rhizosphere and how plants and the microbial  
**[0:44:52-0:44:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:44:52):**  community really interact and glean those insights.  
**[0:44:56-0:45:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:44:56):**  And I mean, from that, I think you for sure could see some startups come out of that new  
**[0:45:01-0:45:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:45:01):**  intellectual discovery.  
**[0:45:03-0:45:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:45:03):**  My hope is that we're just at the beginning stages of understanding how nature actually  
**[0:45:09-0:45:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:45:09):**  is interconnected in every way and how we can actually farm more resiliently and more  
**[0:45:18-0:45:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:45:18):**  profitably by harnessing those natural systems and those natural methodologies instead of  
**[0:45:25-0:45:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:45:25):**  trying to bet on man outsmarting nature, which to a certain extent has worked remarkably  
**[0:45:33-0:45:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:45:33):**  well.  
**[0:45:34-0:45:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:45:34):**  But I think we're now understanding the negative side of that.  
**[0:45:37-0:45:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:45:37):**  And I'm excited to see where we can go as a society in a global community if we harness  
**[0:45:43-0:45:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:45:43):**  the intelligence of nature and begin to create products and services and markets and methodologies  
**[0:45:49-0:45:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:45:49):**  around that instead of trying to dominate nature.  
**[0:45:52-0:45:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:45:52):**  Yeah, I think we're starting to learn that nature is running a marathon and we are just  
**[0:45:57-0:45:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:45:57):**  sprinting and this is a long game we're playing.  
**[0:45:59-0:46:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:45:59):**  I think it's what is it, 3.9 billion years of R&D that the biomechanical community keeps  
**[0:46:04-0:46:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:46:04):**  throwing at us and they're right.  
**[0:46:06-0:46:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:46:06):**  This is a very different timescale we're playing on and we're just starting to understand.  
**[0:46:12-0:46:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:46:12):**  Obviously most indigenous tribes knew that and know that and knew that since forever  
**[0:46:18-0:46:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:46:18):**  and we just forgot it.  
**[0:46:20-0:46:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:46:20):**  For sure.  
**[0:46:21-0:46:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:46:21):**  Some of this is we just need to rediscover from our ancestors for sure.  
**[0:46:24-0:46:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:46:24):**  And it's a nice segue into my final question.  
**[0:46:26-0:46:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:46:26):**  What do you believe to be true about regenerative agriculture that others don't?  
**[0:46:30-0:46:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:46:30):**  Like why are you contrarian?  
**[0:46:32-0:46:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:46:32):**  Definitely inspired by a question that John Kent always asks.  
**[0:46:35-0:46:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:46:35):**  Yeah.  
**[0:46:36-0:46:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:46:36):**  I was about to just, I think another John Kent quote is nature doesn't make mistakes.  
**[0:46:39-0:46:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:46:39):**  I was just about to say that as well.  
**[0:46:42-0:46:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:46:42):**  I think it's all about healing.  
**[0:46:44-0:46:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:46:44):**  I think regenerative means healing and we need to heal our bodies.  
**[0:46:49-0:46:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:46:49):**  We need to heal our society and our institutions.  
**[0:46:52-0:46:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:46:52):**  We need to heal our planet, natural systems.  
**[0:46:55-0:47:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:46:55):**  And to me, soil is the only place where you can find all that healing in one place.  
**[0:47:01-0:47:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:47:01):**  And I guess that's, I mean, I don't know if that's.  
**[0:47:03-0:47:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:47:03):**  It's a perfect answer.  
**[0:47:04-0:47:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:47:04):**  Too contrarian.  
**[0:47:05-0:47:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:47:05):**  No, I mean, how can you be too contrarian?  
**[0:47:08-0:47:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:47:08):**  That's like a, that's impossible.  
**[0:47:09-0:47:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:47:09):**  Yeah.  
**[0:47:10-0:47:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:47:10):**  That to me is why I'm dedicating my, myself to regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:47:14-0:47:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:47:14):**  I think we are in need of healing and soil uniquely can heal planetary health and human  
**[0:47:21-0:47:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:47:21):**  health in one fell swoop if we do it right.  
**[0:47:24-0:47:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:47:24):**  So that's the way I do it.  
**[0:47:25-0:47:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:47:25):**  Thank you so much, Mark, for your time.  
**[0:47:27-0:47:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:47:27):**  It's a perfect end of this interview.  
**[0:47:29-0:47:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:47:29):**  Probably not the last one we do.  
**[0:47:30-0:47:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:47:30):**  I'd love to check in to see the other investments you've made by then.  
**[0:47:34-0:47:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:47:34):**  And of course, to follow the fundraising.

**[0:48:42-0:48:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:48:42):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[0:48:43-0:48:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:48:43):**  After 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question how to put money  
**[0:48:48-0:48:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:48:48):**  to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011 and recording

**[0:49:35-0:49:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:49:35):**  People that are building soil at scale.  
**[0:49:38-0:49:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:49:38):**  And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office  
**[0:49:41-0:49:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:49:41):**  or as private individuals or people who are putting other people's money to work through

**[0:49:52-0:49:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:49:52):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:49:54-0:49:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:49:54):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.  
**[0:49:58-0:50:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:49:58):**  And I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very  
**[0:50:03-0:50:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:50:03):**  different means.  
**[0:50:04-0:50:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:50:04):**  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you, and if you have the means to  
**[0:50:09-0:50:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:50:09):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[0:50:12-0:50:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:50:12):**  Thank you.  
**[0:50:13-0:50:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:50:13):**  So what is this course?  
**[0:50:14-0:50:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:50:14):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  
**[0:50:20-0:50:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:50:20):**  so you don't have to write along.  
**[0:50:22-0:50:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:50:22):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:50:27-0:50:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:50:27):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:50:33-0:50:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:50:33):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find, or what kind of investors you could  
**[0:50:37-0:50:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:50:37):**  find if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:50:39-0:50:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:50:39):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:50:44-0:50:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:50:44):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:50:48-0:50:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:50:48):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design, and a lot more.  
**[0:50:53-0:50:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:50:53):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:50:54-0:50:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:50:54):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:50:56-0:50:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:50:56):**  Unfortunately, that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:50:58-0:51:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:50:58):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:51:02-0:51:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:51:02):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:51:04-0:51:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:51:04):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.  
**[0:51:09-0:51:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mark-lewis#t=0:51:09):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea, or whatever you're drinking.

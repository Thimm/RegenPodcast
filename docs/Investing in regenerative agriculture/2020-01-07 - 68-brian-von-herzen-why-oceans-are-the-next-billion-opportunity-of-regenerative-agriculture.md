**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:00:14):**  This interview is a deep dive literally into the world of marine permaculture and seaweed  
**[0:00:18-0:00:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:00:18):**  and why the Regen-ag movement shouldn't stop at the shoreline but continues into our seas  
**[0:00:23-0:00:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:00:23):**  and oceans.  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:00:27):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture, Investing as if  
**[0:00:31-0:00:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:00:31):**  the Planet Mattered, a podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative  
**[0:00:35-0:00:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:00:35):**  food and agriculture space to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate  
**[0:00:40-0:00:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:00:40):**  soil, people, local communities and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:47-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:00:47):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:49-0:00:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:00:49):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:00:53-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:00:53):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat and it's time that we as investors, big and small,  
**[0:00:58-0:01:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:00:58):**  and consumers start paying much more attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:01:05):**  In March last year we launched our Patreon community to make it easy for fans to support

**[0:01:28-0:01:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:01:28):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:30-0:01:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:01:30):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:01:33):**  Today I'm joined by Brian von Herzen, Executive Director of the Climate Foundation and the  
**[0:01:37-0:01:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:01:37):**  original founder of the Marine Permaculture Movement.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:01:41):**  I'm very interested to dive deeper into something we haven't discussed too much, the seas, the  
**[0:01:45-0:01:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:01:45):**  connection from the seas to the soils.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:01:47):**  Welcome Brian.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:01:48):**  Oh, thank you.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:01:49):**  Thanks John, it's a pleasure to be here.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:01:52):**  And to start with a personal question, what brings you to this space?  
**[0:01:56-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:01:56):**  What brings you to seaweed, soils, region ag, of all the other research topics, of all  
**[0:02:00-0:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:02:00):**  the other topics you could have spent your life on?  
**[0:02:03-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:02:03):**  Well nearly two decades ago we were doing some expeditions across Greenland in a small  
**[0:02:09-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:02:09):**  plane and we noticed the surface of Greenland was melting and it was a very small melt ponds  
**[0:02:17-0:02:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:02:17):**  to begin with, but each year that we crossed the size of the melt ponds were increasing,  
**[0:02:23-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:02:23):**  doubling in size.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:02:25):**  After a couple years they were calling them melt lakes and then by 2012 97% of the surface  
**[0:02:30-0:02:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:02:30):**  of Greenland melted and we realized even in the early 2000s that we had to do something  
**[0:02:35-0:02:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:02:35):**  sustainable to try to address this exponential increase in melting.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:02:41):**  And that led me to do a sabbatical in Woods Hall in studying algae biology and carbon  
**[0:02:47-0:02:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:02:47):**  biogeochemistry and then beyond that to really consider how can we enlist life to help us  
**[0:02:55-0:02:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:02:55):**  rebalance carbon in our seas and in our soils.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:02:59):**  And you work on a lot of different topics.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:03:02):**  I'm definitely going to link your website and a lot of your talks below, but in this  
**[0:03:06-0:03:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:03:06):**  case, this conversation I would like to focus on the finance side of things, the investor  
**[0:03:11-0:03:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:03:11):**  side of things, because I know a lot of listeners will be very excited after, I hope at least  
**[0:03:16-0:03:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:03:16):**  after this interview, so I hope we can give them some direction and some focus.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:03:21):**  So I would like to ask a question on, basically you're mentioning the connection between the  
**[0:03:25-0:03:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:03:25):**  mountains and the sea and I think it's something we focus a lot on the soil and on the land  
**[0:03:30-0:03:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:03:30):**  side of things.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:03:31):**  Why is that connection between the mountains and the sea so important?  
**[0:03:34-0:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:03:34):**  The mountains help the sea and the sea helps the mountains, or I should say the soils.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:03:39):**  So I just finished giving a talk here in Morocco where I was visiting with the government and  
**[0:03:44-0:03:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:03:44):**  we met with some of the agriculture and some of the aquaculture groups here and agencies  
**[0:03:50-0:03:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:03:50):**  and it was very interesting because I spoke about my home state of California where we've  
**[0:03:54-0:03:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:03:54):**  studied the kelp forests and you know, there's a shifting baseline.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:03:58):**  No one has a living memory of the kelp forests that were off the coast of California in the  
**[0:04:05-0:04:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:04:05):**  mid 1800s.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:04:06):**  But we went back and did the research to find the original U.S. Geodetic Survey maps from  
**[0:04:12-0:04:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:04:12):**  1850s, 1860s, 1880s, which showed a river of a kelp a kilometer wide extending from  
**[0:04:21-0:04:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:04:21):**  Point Concepcion, hundreds of kilometers all the way past the border with Mexico.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:04:27):**  And this was a continuous river of kelp between 10 and 25 meters depth that was covering the  
**[0:04:32-0:04:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:04:32):**  coastline and it was this incredible bounty of nature.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:04:36):**  Now what happened was in the early 1900s we had development of farming, urbanization,  
**[0:04:42-0:04:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:04:42):**  but primarily the loss of soil and runoff that went into the sea because of standard  
**[0:04:48-0:04:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:04:48):**  farming practices and that was exacerbated later.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:04:51):**  And between the silt and the nutrients, the visibility in the water dropped precipitously  
**[0:04:56-0:05:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:04:56):**  and this actually choked off the juvenile kelp from growing from a depth of 25 meters  
**[0:05:01-0:05:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:05:01):**  to the surface.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:05:02):**  So if they don't have enough sunlight they can't grow all the way to the surface.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:05:05):**  If they can't grow they don't survive.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:05:07):**  And so we lost the deep kelps and we lost some of the middle kelps and so now we only  
**[0:05:11-0:05:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:05:11):**  have a small remnant of the forest that once was.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:05:14):**  And so this is how our farming practices can affect the sea and the sea clarity.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:05:21):**  And so if we do less runoff and more regenerative farming we can actually have a much clearer  
**[0:05:25-0:05:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:05:25):**  ocean.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:05:26):**  And conversely the seaweeds have this incredible input, a catalytic input almost, on the growth  
**[0:05:33-0:05:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:05:33):**  of crops both as a soil amendment and also as a seaweed foliar biostimulant.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:05:38):**  And in several other ways, for example, as a feed supplement for ruminant livestock,  
**[0:05:43-0:05:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:05:43):**  it can cut most of the methane of the enteric emissions of ruminant livestock.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:05:48):**  So there's so many ways that the sea gives back to the farm and gives back to the soil  
**[0:05:52-0:05:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:05:52):**  and I think it's a full circle, a circular value chain if you will.  
**[0:05:56-0:05:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:05:56):**  And I mean there's so much to unpack there.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:05:58):**  Let's start with, because I've seen and heard a number of farmers talk about seaweed on  
**[0:06:04-0:06:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:06:04):**  their farm, so they basically bring seaweed which has been grown at the sea obviously  
**[0:06:08-0:06:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:06:08):**  to their farm as a soil amendment as you mentioned.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:06:12):**  Is that happening at scale and if not what would be necessary to really kick start that  
**[0:06:18-0:06:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:06:18):**  part of the industry?  
**[0:06:19-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:06:19):**  Which I think to farmers looks very interesting because it is that full circle of maybe some  
**[0:06:23-0:06:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:06:23):**  of the old runoff that was captured by the seaweed and now no longer has runoff because  
**[0:06:27-0:06:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:06:27):**  they're doing regenerative farming but they still need some of those input back basically  
**[0:06:31-0:06:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:06:31):**  to kick start their system.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:06:32):**  Is that something you see on a small scale and if so what would be necessary to really  
**[0:06:37-0:06:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:06:37):**  scale that up?  
**[0:06:38-0:06:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:06:38):**  There is small scale incorporation of kelp and seaweeds off the coast of California for  
**[0:06:42-0:06:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:06:42):**  example and to some extent utilized in Australia permaculture as well where the kelps and the  
**[0:06:48-0:06:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:06:48):**  seaweeds provide micronutrients, they provide polysaccharides, growth stimulants, the natural  
**[0:06:56-0:07:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:06:56):**  glibaryllins and auxins and cytokines that help plants grow exist in seaweed.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:07:02):**  And so scientists and researchers have had a hard time isolating a single compound that  
**[0:07:07-0:07:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:07:07):**  does it.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:07:08):**  There seems to be a synergy between polysaccharides, beneficial proteins, plant growth regulation  
**[0:07:15-0:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:07:15):**  and micronutrients that together have a transformative effect on the production of the soil.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:07:21):**  We've seen peer review literature citing to 11% increase in rice, 20% increase in vegetables,  
**[0:07:29-0:07:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:07:29):**  40% increase in eggplants and one or two published studies showing 56% increase in yields on  
**[0:07:35-0:07:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:07:35):**  soybeans and this is using seaweed foliar biostimulants.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:07:39):**  Now that's a very small application rate, it's only a few liters per acre or maybe four  
**[0:07:45-0:07:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:07:45):**  liters per hectare but even at these very low rates there are significant yield increases  
**[0:07:51-0:07:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:07:51):**  in agriculture.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:07:52):**  Then furthermore there's a notion of a soil amendment, the mulch, the compost and that  
**[0:07:56-0:08:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:07:56):**  would be a larger application of solid seaweeds and as long as you can manage these very small  
**[0:08:01-0:08:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:08:01):**  levels the salinity is not a factor and you can track it at larger levels as well and  
**[0:08:08-0:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:08:08):**  I think those are key areas.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:08:11):**  In terms of scale today, Ascofilum rockweed is harvested from Maine, from Canada, from  
**[0:08:18-0:08:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:08:18):**  Iceland, even parts of Europe and has been used in relatively large quantity in I would  
**[0:08:24-0:08:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:08:24):**  call them seaweed soil amendments and whatnot that are used a fair amount in commercial  
**[0:08:30-0:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:08:30):**  and personal farms today.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:08:34):**  That's a good starting point but this northern seaweed has different effects than the tropical  
**[0:08:38-0:08:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:08:38):**  red seaweeds and the tropical brown seaweeds and even some of the kelps.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:08:43):**  So I think that there are different types of seaweed and the right combination of seaweed  
**[0:08:49-0:08:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:08:49):**  for particular plants is going to be a key opportunity to develop in the months and years  
**[0:08:54-0:08:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:08:54):**  ahead.  
**[0:08:55-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:08:55):**  So you would see a lot of opportunity in basically mixing and trying to find the right recipe  
**[0:09:02-0:09:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:09:02):**  for the right type of crop or cropland basically to mix or to connect them better.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:09:09):**  Yes in particular what we're noticing is that seaweed does a fantastic job of increasing  
**[0:09:14-0:09:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:09:14):**  the stress resistance of the plants and that includes resistance to heat, resistance to  
**[0:09:21-0:09:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:09:21):**  drought and resistance to disease.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:09:24):**  And you know all crops have some amount of stress but when we get into a global warming  
**[0:09:29-0:09:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:09:29):**  situation the amount of heat stress and the amount of drought becomes severe and the seaweeds  
**[0:09:36-0:09:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:09:36):**  have been able to confer stress resistance to these crops very substantially.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:09:41):**  It's one of the best approaches and we're noticing that the tropical red and the tropical  
**[0:09:46-0:09:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:09:46):**  brown seaweeds are particularly effective at some of these stress resistance increases.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:09:52):**  And does it change the flavor?  
**[0:09:53-0:09:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:09:53):**  No not at all.  
**[0:09:54-0:09:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:09:54):**  But I also mean does it improve it maybe?  
**[0:09:56-0:09:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:09:56):**  Well that's a good question.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:09:58):**  If you look at the micronutrient levels of our vegetables over the last few decades we've  
**[0:10:06-0:10:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:10:06):**  lost most of the micronutrients of the vegetables due to this leaching.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:10:10):**  And you know seaweeds have every element in nature and some abundance in their composition.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:10:16):**  So when you put the seaweed back into the soil and even at these very small quantities  
**[0:10:22-0:10:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:10:22):**  you're getting these micronutrients that can help to actually regenerate the micronutrient  
**[0:10:27-0:10:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:10:27):**  value of our vegetables.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:10:29):**  So I think there is an enormous value there and we like to use seaweed for food feed and  
**[0:10:34-0:10:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:10:34):**  fertilizer and I think yes it's great for the soil and micronutrients and that part  
**[0:10:39-0:10:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:10:39):**  was fine.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:10:40):**  And then we're also seeing amazing superfood properties of eating small amounts of seaweed  
**[0:10:46-0:10:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:10:46):**  every day.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:10:47):**  I mean every time I go surfing I'm eating seaweed when I'm out there.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:10:50):**  You know it's clean water and I've got some kelp or some seaweed that is rooted to the  
**[0:10:54-0:10:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:10:54):**  rocks out there.  
**[0:10:56-0:11:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:10:56):**  There's 14,000 species to try and nearly all of them are edible and most of my knowledge  
**[0:11:02-0:11:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:11:02):**  in fact almost all of them are non-toxic.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:11:05):**  And I think that's a let's say the nutrient density of food and the connection to healthy  
**[0:11:09-0:11:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:11:09):**  soil something that comes back in this podcast a lot of times and I think it's potentially  
**[0:11:14-0:11:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:11:14):**  one of the keys to unlock the sector and to really get the consumer or at least the food  
**[0:11:18-0:11:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:11:18):**  sector more and more interested in healthy soils.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:11:22):**  That is so true.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:11:23):**  I think you know seaweed as a nutraceutical has been absolutely amazing.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:11:27):**  I just finished meeting with some researchers in Europe that have studied the effects of  
**[0:11:34-0:11:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:11:34):**  seaweed for many diseases.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:11:37):**  One study I saw in the US that was about Asia showed of course on a countrywide basis about  
**[0:11:44-0:11:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:11:44):**  seven times less breast cancer in countries like Thailand and Japan and furthermore in  
**[0:11:49-0:11:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:11:49):**  a mouse model for breast cancer they observed 10 to 20 times lower tumor incidence in breast  
**[0:11:55-0:12:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:11:55):**  cancer when a small amount of seaweed was added to the water supply of these mice.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:12:02):**  And that was very substantial because otherwise the diets were identical and so they were  
**[0:12:07-0:12:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:12:07):**  able to reproduce this cancer effectiveness that the seaweed was very surprising.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:12:13):**  The European studies focused on Alzheimer's models for mice and they had these mouse models  
**[0:12:19-0:12:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:12:19):**  for Alzheimer's and these were elderly mice and you know we're not able in this advanced  
**[0:12:26-0:12:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:12:26):**  stage of the disease we're unable to remember how to get through a maze.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:12:32):**  But when they added a moderate amount of seaweed to the water supply for these mice they actually  
**[0:12:39-0:12:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:12:39):**  recovered the ability of short-term memory to understand how to get through the maze.  
**[0:12:44-0:12:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:12:44):**  And so these neuroprotective benefits and other health benefits of seaweed have been  
**[0:12:50-0:12:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:12:50):**  amazing to read about in the peer-reviewed literature.  
**[0:12:52-0:12:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:12:52):**  I think we can, I mean this is absolutely fascinating, we can probably spend two hours  
**[0:12:56-0:12:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:12:56):**  just as food or seaweed as medicine.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:12:59):**  But if the advantages and many of these actually have been clear for a while, a lot of this  
**[0:13:05-0:13:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:13:05):**  research is coming up now, but like the ecosystem services, the potential of cleaning up a lot  
**[0:13:10-0:13:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:13:10):**  of the leaching etc has been known for quite a while, maybe not to the extent, and also  
**[0:13:14-0:13:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:13:14):**  not to the extent of how much seaweed there actually was or in this case is the kelp forest  
**[0:13:19-0:13:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:13:19):**  in California.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:13:20):**  I think we all suffer from that, nobody can imagine anymore how full the Mediterranean  
**[0:13:24-0:13:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:13:24):**  was with life as it is, nobody has seen it in their lifetime.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:13:29):**  What is stopping this gigantic, let's say regeneration of our, even just our coastal  
**[0:13:35-0:13:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:13:35):**  areas, if the advantages and the returns in all different aspects, not just financial,  
**[0:13:41-0:13:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:13:41):**  are so enormous?  
**[0:13:42-0:13:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:13:42):**  What do you see as the biggest barriers?  
**[0:13:43-0:13:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:13:43):**  Well, first of all, there's a nutrient barrier and that's what we studied about the ecosystems.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:13:48):**  If we go back to the Permian extinction 250 million years ago, we find that the development  
**[0:13:55-0:14:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:13:55):**  of that Permian extinction was associated with warming and stratification of the oceans.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:14:00):**  And as the oceans warm, 93% of global warming is going into the oceans, we create this stratified  
**[0:14:06-0:14:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:14:06):**  layer of water and that forms a barrier to the upwelling that provides nutrients to algae.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:14:14):**  And so the normal amount of offshore winds would normally bring the water up to the surface  
**[0:14:19-0:14:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:14:19):**  and cause the overturning circulation and enable the seaweed to grow, and that gets  
**[0:14:25-0:14:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:14:25):**  shut down when the ocean gets too warm.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:14:29):**  And so we saw that in the Permian extinction where 96% of all marine life went extinct.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:14:35):**  And according to the recent studies, we've already lost 2% of the oxygen in the ocean.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:14:40):**  And so we're 2% of the way towards the Permian extinction.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:14:43):**  And the question is, can we stop it and reverse it one kelp forest at a time using this kind  
**[0:14:48-0:14:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:14:48):**  of overturning principle?  
**[0:14:50-0:14:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:14:50):**  And this would apply from the Mediterranean to the tropical oceans, even the subtropics.  
**[0:14:55-0:15:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:14:55):**  So basically, what you're saying is there's this layer of water in the oceans or in the  
**[0:15:00-0:15:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:15:00):**  seas, which is blocking the nutrient rich sub layer to come up basically.  
**[0:15:05-0:15:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:15:05):**  And that's what you're working on in marine permaculture, right?  
**[0:15:08-0:15:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:15:08):**  To reverse that?  
**[0:15:09-0:15:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:15:09):**  We are.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:15:10):**  We look to the tropics to use marine solar energy, also waves in the ocean, and even  
**[0:15:15-0:15:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:15:15):**  wind energy in the higher latitudes to restore overturning circulation.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:15:20):**  We have pipes that come up from below the thermocline.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:15:22):**  We can provide up to a million cubic meters of seawater per day to a larger seaweed permaculture  
**[0:15:28-0:15:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:15:28):**  and effectively enable the irrigation 12 months a year of seaweed forest and enable it to  
**[0:15:35-0:15:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:15:35):**  grow at least as much as it did under natural conditions, pre industrially.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:15:39):**  Yeah, so you're building these big pumps, as I'm imagining them, and I've seen them  
**[0:15:44-0:15:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:15:44):**  in the past, to basically pump up this water or bring up this water from underneath this  
**[0:15:47-0:15:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:15:47):**  blockage.  
**[0:15:48-0:15:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:15:48):**  You've been doing that at different places.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:15:50):**  What are the results?  
**[0:15:51-0:15:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:15:51):**  How fast is this?  
**[0:15:53-0:15:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:15:53):**  What is the impact also beyond just the area around the pump?  
**[0:15:57-0:16:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:15:57):**  Well, the first places we tested were in Hawaii.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:16:00):**  And then from there, we went on and won the Blue Economy Challenge from the Australian  
**[0:16:04-0:16:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:16:04):**  Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:16:06):**  And there, they provided us with resources needed to do a small test system in Indonesia.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:16:12):**  And in Indonesia, we found that with irrigation, the seaweeds were able to grow more than 2%  
**[0:16:18-0:16:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:16:18):**  per day, whereas without the irrigation, it was less than 2%.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:16:22):**  Now we're replicating those results in the Philippines.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:16:26):**  And in the future, we hope to also do this testing with Macrocystis brown kelps off Tasmania,  
**[0:16:33-0:16:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:16:33):**  where we've been working with the University of Tasmania and our partners at 2040 and the  
**[0:16:39-0:16:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:16:39):**  Intrepid Foundation.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:16:40):**  And this sounds like a proof of concept.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:16:43):**  What is needed to get this to market and needed to scale as we're hopefully getting to a lot  
**[0:16:48-0:16:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:16:48):**  of investors and entrepreneurs through this podcast?  
**[0:16:52-0:16:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:16:52):**  What do you see as the next steps to really make this widely available?  
**[0:16:57-0:17:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:16:57):**  We'll be moving over the next year from a small platform to a hectare scale platform.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:17:03):**  And with the hectare in place, we'll be able to do so much more and really demonstrate  
**[0:17:07-0:17:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:17:07):**  the economics of scaling to 100 hectares and more.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:17:11):**  We're very happy to have the support of Jeremy Grantham and his contributions have enabled  
**[0:17:17-0:17:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:17:17):**  us to really develop the marine permaculture up to a hectare scale.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:17:22):**  So we're looking forward to developing that initially in the Philippines and then showing  
**[0:17:27-0:17:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:17:27):**  that it works in temperate latitudes such as Tasmania once we permit it with the authorities  
**[0:17:33-0:17:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:17:33):**  there.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:17:34):**  But then furthermore to develop it in key countries like Indonesia where there are more  
**[0:17:39-0:17:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:17:39):**  than 2 million seaweed farmers, they grow hectares of seaweed, but they're on the front  
**[0:17:44-0:17:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:17:44):**  lines of climate disruption.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:17:45):**  And the warm layer of water is preventing a lot of the production.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:17:49):**  During the marine heat wave of 2016, over 60% of the yield of the seaweed farms was  
**[0:17:56-0:18:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:17:56):**  lost and over half of the seaweed farms were abandoned on some islands in Indonesia.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:18:02):**  So we have to help recover that in the subsistence seaweed farmers there in Indonesia.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:18:07):**  We really need to develop that capability so that the Indonesian farmers can have the  
**[0:18:14-0:18:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:18:14):**  climate resilience that's built into the irrigation provided with deep sea water marine permaculture.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:18:21):**  Just as a background, Jeremy Grantham is one of the founders of GMO, which is a big asset  
**[0:18:25-0:18:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:18:25):**  manager which has nothing to do with GMO agriculture, but his foundation has been very active in  
**[0:18:31-0:18:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:18:31):**  climate solutions.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:18:32):**  I think he committed over a billion dollars recently to the climate change fight.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:18:37):**  And then secondly, I think it's so basically, you could almost see this as you're partnering  
**[0:18:41-0:18:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:18:41):**  with seaweed farmers to enable them to be more climate resistant by basically growing  
**[0:18:47-0:18:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:18:47):**  more or up to the original level or maybe beyond of what they were growing.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:18:52):**  But they already have a market.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:18:53):**  So that's not a part you have to develop for the seaweed because they have offtake.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:18:57):**  But they are being threatened now by climate change and by changing oceans around them  
**[0:19:01-0:19:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:19:01):**  basically.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:19:02):**  So marine permaculture irrigation is a new product for an existing market.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:19:06):**  It's over a $10 billion industry already in Asia.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:19:08):**  And we see huge opportunities to develop these technologies further for regions of Europe,  
**[0:19:15-0:19:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:19:15):**  including the Mediterranean, including the tropical Atlantic and tropical and subtropical  
**[0:19:20-0:19:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:19:20):**  Pacific oceans.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:19:21):**  And just to paint a picture, what do you envision in the Mediterranean as it seems not only  
**[0:19:26-0:19:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:19:26):**  for Europe, but it seems an enormous hotspot the next decade or decades for climate change  
**[0:19:33-0:19:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:19:33):**  for, I heard Morocco is going up five degrees and in terms of refugees, climate change,  
**[0:19:38-0:19:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:19:38):**  stress, agriculture and obviously water.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:19:41):**  What would you envision that we could do in the next decade?  
**[0:19:44-0:19:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:19:44):**  Well, imagine regenerating life in the Mediterranean.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:19:48):**  We aspire to restoring the sardines in Sardinia.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:19:52):**  We aspire to effectively creating the upwelling that's going to enable the seaweed forest  
**[0:19:59-0:20:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:19:59):**  to thrive, the creation of fish habitat.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:20:02):**  And ultimately this bootstraps the sardines, the forage fish populations and the game fish  
**[0:20:08-0:20:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:20:08):**  and even the apex predators.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:20:09):**  We have the opportunity to regenerate life in the oceans.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:20:12):**  I imagine that the sardines might've been named after the island of Sardinia and wouldn't  
**[0:20:19-0:20:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:20:19):**  it be great if we could regenerate those sardine fisheries from Israel all the way across to  
**[0:20:26-0:20:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:20:26):**  Spain and Portugal.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:20:28):**  And if you would, let's imagine there's a theater full of active impact investors, people  
**[0:20:32-0:20:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:20:32):**  that are enthusiastic about Regeneic or enthusiastic about marine permaculture.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:20:37):**  What would you tell them without giving investment advice, obviously, but what would you tell  
**[0:20:41-0:20:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:20:41):**  them where to look, what kind of questions to ask if they see things?  
**[0:20:45-0:20:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:20:45):**  Because for sure they've been approached by algae companies, seaweed companies, this is  
**[0:20:50-0:20:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:20:50):**  the future, left and right, et cetera.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:20:51):**  What would you advise them to look out for, to what kind of questions to ask when getting  
**[0:20:58-0:21:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:20:58):**  into this part of the Regeneic sector?  
**[0:21:00-0:21:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:21:00):**  Well, I think there's a key opportunity and that is developing new products for existing  
**[0:21:05-0:21:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:21:05):**  industries and that's one reason we've been doing a lot of work, irrigation and seaweed  
**[0:21:08-0:21:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:21:08):**  farms.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:21:09):**  And beyond that, we're looking at a $350 billion agricultural input market, a $600 billion  
**[0:21:17-0:21:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:21:17):**  nutraceutical market and an $800 billion cosmetics market.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:21:21):**  And seaweed has a central role to play in all of those.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:21:24):**  We find time and again, we're supply limited as to how much kelp, how much red seaweed  
**[0:21:29-0:21:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:21:29):**  we can actually produce.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:21:31):**  There's a global shortage of capyphyca seaweed, for example, and the prices have doubled over  
**[0:21:35-0:21:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:21:35):**  the last year or two.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:21:37):**  And this is associated with a decreased production associated with higher temperatures in the  
**[0:21:41-0:21:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:21:41):**  tropics.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:21:42):**  So we've got a key opportunity and that is to regenerate that production, enable the  
**[0:21:46-0:21:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:21:46):**  industry to get going again and to thrive, and then to further develop these markets  
**[0:21:50-0:21:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:21:50):**  as the research is coming out on the nutraceutical side, we can improve the health span and I  
**[0:21:56-0:22:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:21:56):**  would say the cognitive health span of so many people around the world that need to  
**[0:22:00-0:22:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:22:00):**  move from a Western diet to something that's much more on the omega-3 side.  
**[0:22:04-0:22:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:22:04):**  And keep in mind, these algae are the original source of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:22:10):**  The sardines get it from the algae.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:22:12):**  So the original source is actually a vegetarian source.  
**[0:22:15-0:22:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:22:15):**  So you can go directly to the source and skipping the whole fish process in the middle.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:22:20):**  Well, you can for those, I mean, there's half a half a billion vegetarians in India alone.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:22:25):**  So imagine vegetarians around the world who can improve their nutrition by a suitable  
**[0:22:31-0:22:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:22:31):**  addition of seaweeds from around the world as well and locally.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:22:36):**  And you mentioned somewhere in an interview I listened to actually, you're looking for  
**[0:22:40-0:22:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:22:40):**  positive outliers.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:22:42):**  Can you explain a bit of the concept behind that?  
**[0:22:45-0:22:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:22:45):**  And how do you find them?  
**[0:22:46-0:22:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:22:46):**  What kind of framework you have to look for these outliers?  
**[0:22:49-0:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:22:49):**  Well, I remember after the Vietnam War, there was a serious problem with starvation and  
**[0:22:56-0:23:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:22:56):**  children, and I remember that some physicians went to Vietnam and they noticed that a few  
**[0:23:04-0:23:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:23:04):**  of the children were not being given more food, but they weren't starving.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:23:08):**  And they did a lot of interviewing and eventually discovered a positive outlier.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:23:12):**  And there were several actually.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:23:13):**  One is that the mothers of these children were giving them four half bowls of rice per  
**[0:23:19-0:23:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:23:19):**  day rather than two cups of rice per day.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:23:23):**  And so the more frequent meals and smaller portions were helpful.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:23:27):**  But they were also grabbing little bits of shrimp and crab that were growing in the rice  
**[0:23:31-0:23:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:23:31):**  fields and they were adding this little bit of protein to the top of the rice.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:23:36):**  And that tiny bit of addition of protein in minute quantities was sufficient to actually  
**[0:23:42-0:23:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:23:42):**  enable muscle building and development and all these other things.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:23:46):**  And so these tiny little bits of protein had a substantial effect as well.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:23:50):**  And so these were examples in a medical context and a nutrition context where the positive  
**[0:23:55-0:23:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:23:55):**  outliers were key.  
**[0:23:57-0:24:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:23:57):**  But we also think in terms of ecosystems.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:24:00):**  The kelp forest is the tropical rainforest of so many countries, including Morocco, including  
**[0:24:07-0:24:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:24:07):**  California, including Australia.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:24:10):**  You look to the Brazilian rainforest and the Amazon for being one of the most productive  
**[0:24:15-0:24:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:24:15):**  ecosystems on the planet and it's able to fix approximately 2200 grams of carbon per  
**[0:24:21-0:24:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:24:21):**  square meter per year.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:24:23):**  But what's fascinating to me is that the kelp forest in their natural setting are actually  
**[0:24:28-0:24:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:24:28):**  fixing 2500 grams of carbon, in some cases all the way up to 3000 grams of carbon per  
**[0:24:34-0:24:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:24:34):**  square meter per year.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:24:36):**  And that means that the actual carbon flux is higher in the kelp forest than it is in  
**[0:24:42-0:24:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:24:42):**  the tropical rainforest.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:24:43):**  Now some of it gets eaten and respired and returns to the air.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:24:47):**  But the fact that this natural ecosystem is capturing more carbon than the tropical rainforest  
**[0:24:53-0:24:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:24:53):**  is really substantial.  
**[0:24:54-0:25:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:24:54):**  And the fact that we could find with marine permaculture substrate and marine permaculture  
**[0:25:00-0:25:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:25:00):**  upwelling, we can take this beautiful ecosystem at the edge of the ocean and apply it to the  
**[0:25:07-0:25:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:25:07):**  entire 300 kilometers of the exclusive economic zone of so many countries, from Morocco to  
**[0:25:14-0:25:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:25:14):**  parts of Europe to the Americas and on to Asia.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:25:18):**  United Nations talks about small island developing states, SIDS nations, and yet more recently  
**[0:25:24-0:25:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:25:24):**  people have been calling them big ocean nations because even a small island nation could have  
**[0:25:28-0:25:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:25:28):**  several million square kilometers of a big ocean around them.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:25:33):**  And so this is a huge opportunity for coastal nations around the world to embrace the regeneration  
**[0:25:40-0:25:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:25:40):**  of life in the sea, to rebuild the seaweed forests, regenerate fish habitat, and regenerate  
**[0:25:46-0:25:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:25:46):**  the sardine fisheries and the forage fisheries that 3 billion people on the planet rely upon  
**[0:25:52-0:25:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:25:52):**  for their primary source of protein.  
**[0:25:54-0:25:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:25:54):**  So it's a big opportunity to really understand how can we use these natural processes to  
**[0:25:59-0:26:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:25:59):**  regenerate life on the earth.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:26:01):**  And I consider really understanding the kelp forest and seaweed ecosystems to be central,  
**[0:26:06-0:26:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:26:06):**  positive outliers, examples of how nature has done a great job with fixing carbon during  
**[0:26:11-0:26:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:26:11):**  the last millennia and millions of years.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:26:14):**  Wow, again, so much to unpack, but I'd like to ask two questions.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:26:18):**  One, can you explain a bit how the carbon is stored?  
**[0:26:21-0:26:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:26:21):**  You mentioned some of obviously is getting eaten, some of it is not being stored permanently,  
**[0:26:26-0:26:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:26:26):**  but also some of it is being stored permanently.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:26:29):**  And then I would like to ask a second question on what's the risk?  
**[0:26:32-0:26:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:26:32):**  What's the catch, so to say, and to stay in the theme.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:26:36):**  It sounds too good to be true.  
**[0:26:38-0:26:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:26:38):**  It sounds amazing.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:26:40):**  What is holding it back?  
**[0:26:41-0:26:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:26:41):**  Is it so difficult to build these things at scale because maybe oceans are very rough?  
**[0:26:46-0:26:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:26:46):**  What is the biggest risk or barrier you see?  
**[0:26:49-0:26:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:26:49):**  But let's first start with the carbon storage.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:26:52):**  Professor Carlos Duarte has published some papers studying from Cal State University,  
**[0:26:56-0:27:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:26:56):**  studying how the global seaweed forests export carbon not locally, but into the middle and  
**[0:27:01-0:27:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:27:01):**  deep ocean because of course, seaweed drifts and it drifts into the middle and into the  
**[0:27:06-0:27:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:27:06):**  deeper ocean and then it sinks.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:27:08):**  And so very naturally, some 11% or more of the kelp is stored that way.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:27:12):**  But beyond that, when we actually look to harvesting seaweed at sea, and there's some  
**[0:27:18-0:27:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:27:18):**  work in Europe on developing the biorefinery, which will actually provide from the seaweed  
**[0:27:24-0:27:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:27:24):**  harvest, sustainable partial harvest, a bounty of nutraceuticals, high value proteins, polysaccharides  
**[0:27:33-0:27:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:27:33):**  and cellulose and other carbon.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:27:36):**  This produces a, let's say, a cascade of valuable products that come from the seaweed.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:27:42):**  And whatever the seaweed is not used, let's say we use half of it for food and half of  
**[0:27:46-0:27:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:27:46):**  it would be seaweed residues, the leftover seaweed that's not utilized can be sunk into  
**[0:27:53-0:27:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:27:53):**  the middle and deep ocean, providing a true blue carbon sink.  
**[0:27:56-0:28:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:27:56):**  And that could be well over 11%.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:28:00):**  Even most of the seaweed harvest, more than 50% could be residues that would, the seaweed  
**[0:28:05-0:28:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:28:05):**  leftovers would be sunk to the middle and deep ocean in a period of perhaps even two  
**[0:28:10-0:28:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:28:10):**  days that would go below 1000 meters.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:28:12):**  The typical seaweed can drop about 500 meters per day once it's been processed.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:28:18):**  And so with the bubbles collapsed in the seaweed, it'll sink 500 meters a day and then in two  
**[0:28:24-0:28:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:28:24):**  days it's below 1000 meters.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:28:26):**  And our physical oceanographer colleagues have identified that the median time to outcropping  
**[0:28:31-0:28:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:28:31):**  for water that's 1000 meters and deeper is 100 to 4000 years.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:28:36):**  And so that range provides the basis for developing the United Nations carbon credits, where with  
**[0:28:42-0:28:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:28:42):**  100 years as the threshold for developing those.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:28:45):**  So it presents a distinct opportunity to sink substantial amounts of carbon in it while  
**[0:28:50-0:28:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:28:50):**  we're at the same time feeding the world and feeding natural ecosystems.  
**[0:28:54-0:28:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:28:54):**  And so what's the risk?  
**[0:28:55-0:28:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:28:55):**  What do you see as the biggest risk as the interest grows?  
**[0:28:59-0:29:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:28:59):**  Obviously, a lot of people just like in region egg on land are going to jump on this, which  
**[0:29:03-0:29:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:29:03):**  means cowboys, which means projects and things not done well, means a lot of pitch decks  
**[0:29:09-0:29:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:29:09):**  and a lot of floating numbers that promise a lot of things.  
**[0:29:13-0:29:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:29:13):**  What do you see from your experience and being in the space for so long and probably have  
**[0:29:18-0:29:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:29:18):**  seen and spoken to almost everyone?  
**[0:29:20-0:29:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:29:20):**  What do you see as the biggest risk?  
**[0:29:21-0:29:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:29:21):**  Well, in the Americas today, and perhaps in Europe as well, there are some regions near  
**[0:29:25-0:29:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:29:25):**  shore that occasionally have harmful algal blooms.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:29:29):**  And if there were harmful algal blooms already occurring, then marine permaculture upwelling  
**[0:29:34-0:29:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:29:34):**  operation could potentially exacerbate those.  
**[0:29:37-0:29:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:29:37):**  So we need to monitor for the presence or growth of harmful algal blooms upstream.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:29:43):**  And then monitor downstream as well.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:29:45):**  And if there's a situation where there's an exacerbation or some problem is getting worse,  
**[0:29:50-0:29:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:29:50):**  then the marine permaculture can be turned off.  
**[0:29:53-0:29:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:29:53):**  And then that would remove the increase of harmful algal bloom.  
**[0:29:57-0:30:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:29:57):**  So that monitoring for those situations would be important near shore.  
**[0:30:01-0:30:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:30:01):**  Further from shore, the incidence of those harmful algal blooms is far lower.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:30:05):**  So it'd be less of a problem.  
**[0:30:06-0:30:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:30:06):**  But that's an example where by developing a strong marine permaculture industry association,  
**[0:30:12-0:30:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:30:12):**  we'll be able to advise on best practices around the world and ensure that we can develop  
**[0:30:17-0:30:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:30:17):**  a strong industry association that commits to best practices and is able to regulate  
**[0:30:22-0:30:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:30:22):**  the industry well enough within the association to avoid the need for overregulation.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:30:29):**  Because ultimately, we need to do well for the planet while we're actually doing well  
**[0:30:34-0:30:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:30:34):**  for the economics as well.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:30:36):**  And I'd like to be conscious of your time and end with a number of questions, which  
**[0:30:40-0:30:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:30:40):**  usually take up quite a bit of time.  
**[0:30:43-0:30:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:30:43):**  So we're hopefully going to finish on time.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:30:45):**  What if you could wave a magic wand and tomorrow morning, we wake up and you've changed one  
**[0:30:50-0:30:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:30:50):**  thing in the agriculture or aquaculture, let's say food industry, what would that be?  
**[0:30:55-0:31:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:30:55):**  Well, I think we would have the opportunity to work a lot more holistically with our food  
**[0:31:01-0:31:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:31:01):**  sources.  
**[0:31:02-0:31:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:31:02):**  I think we need to move towards a more vegetarian lifestyle.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:31:05):**  And that means vegetables on land and vegetables in the sea.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:31:11):**  And these sea vegetables, there's so many to choose from.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:31:14):**  I think that's really a key part of this.  
**[0:31:16-0:31:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:31:16):**  And as we move towards a somewhat more vegetarian lifestyle with treating meat becomes a condiment  
**[0:31:22-0:31:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:31:22):**  rather than the main course, I think that's an opportunity to really change the way humans  
**[0:31:29-0:31:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:31:29):**  eat.  
**[0:31:30-0:31:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:31:30):**  Kofi Annan, as UN Secretary General said, if there's one thing we could possibly do,  
**[0:31:35-0:31:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:31:35):**  it would be to eat one vegetarian meal per week.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:31:39):**  And not because that by itself would make such a big difference, but it would enable  
**[0:31:44-0:31:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:31:44):**  people to realize how tasty a vegetarian meal could be.  
**[0:31:49-0:31:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:31:49):**  And I think that's a really key because once I've learned how great vegetarian meals could  
**[0:31:55-0:31:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:31:55):**  be, I mean, half the meals I eat are vegetarian.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:31:57):**  I'm not 100% vegetarian, but it's a great way to reduce impact.  
**[0:32:01-0:32:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:32:01):**  And I'm reminded of some other sayings Gandhi, I believe, said, you know, the earth has enough  
**[0:32:09-0:32:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:32:09):**  for everyone's need, but not a single person's greed.  
**[0:32:14-0:32:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:32:14):**  And if we apply that to a more vegetarian lifestyle, I think that is really significant  
**[0:32:18-0:32:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:32:18):**  because we have enough food already to feed 10 billion people on this planet.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:32:23):**  But if we can simply reduce the intensity of the meat production, then so much of that  
**[0:32:28-0:32:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:32:28):**  productivity can go towards feeding the entire planet and having enough food left over for  
**[0:32:33-0:32:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:32:33):**  nature to ensure regeneration of those ecosystems.  
**[0:32:38-0:32:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:32:38):**  And to stay a bit in the livestock discussion, actually, you briefly mentioned and I know  
**[0:32:43-0:32:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:32:43):**  there's quite a bit of research now on the methane, obviously, of livestock, ruminant  
**[0:32:47-0:32:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:32:47):**  livestock and the potential of seaweed there.  
**[0:32:50-0:32:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:32:50):**  Can you briefly explain why that is important and how that came about and where we are,  
**[0:32:56-0:33:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:32:56):**  let's say, as a sector, are we close to feeding it easily to cows or not?  
**[0:33:01-0:33:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:33:01):**  What's the story on the methane, seaweed and livestock?  
**[0:33:03-0:33:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:33:03):**  Yes, first of all, it's important to realize that the methane that we emit each year has  
**[0:33:10-0:33:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:33:10):**  a bigger impact on our climate than the CO2 that's being emitted each year.  
**[0:33:16-0:33:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:33:16):**  And that's because the methane that's being emitted has a multiplier of 28 or 50 or 70  
**[0:33:23-0:33:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:33:23):**  times the CO2 emission.  
**[0:33:25-0:33:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:33:25):**  And so the methane emissions we're doing right now this year has a substantial incremental  
**[0:33:30-0:33:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:33:30):**  impact on the climate.  
**[0:33:32-0:33:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:33:32):**  And the livestock emissions of methane are one of the largest emissions.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:33:37):**  And so if we're able to eliminate most of the enteric emissions of ruminant livestock  
**[0:33:45-0:33:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:33:45):**  of methane, that would have a very significant impact on a very significant source of greenhouse  
**[0:33:51-0:33:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:33:51):**  gases each year.  
**[0:33:52-0:33:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:33:52):**  And so we see this as a big opportunity and the fact that seaweed as an organic feed supplement  
**[0:33:57-0:34:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:33:57):**  at a level of 1 to 10 percent of the feed is able to eliminate most of the enteric emissions  
**[0:34:05-0:34:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:34:05):**  of ruminant livestock is extremely significant.  
**[0:34:07-0:34:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:34:07):**  It moves us towards more organic feed supplements and it also moves us towards a more holistic  
**[0:34:13-0:34:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:34:13):**  lifestyle.  
**[0:34:14-0:34:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:34:14):**  What I love is how the seaweed is eaten by cows on the beach naturally of their own accord.  
**[0:34:21-0:34:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:34:21):**  It's eaten by deer in New Zealand.  
**[0:34:23-0:34:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:34:23):**  It's hundreds of observed deer at night eating seaweed off the beach in New Zealand as an  
**[0:34:29-0:34:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:34:29):**  example.  
**[0:34:30-0:34:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:34:30):**  And the fact that it's being done naturally by these ruminant livestock to me is very  
**[0:34:33-0:34:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:34:33):**  They're so mitigating.  
**[0:34:34-0:34:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:34:34):**  They are.  
**[0:34:35-0:34:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:34:35):**  They are.  
**[0:34:36-0:34:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:34:36):**  They know just the right amount.  
**[0:34:37-0:34:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:34:37):**  We should have seaweed salt licks on pastures around the country, around the world.  
**[0:34:42-0:34:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:34:42):**  And we've got a billion cattle on the planet and whether it's 30 million cattle in Australia  
**[0:34:50-0:34:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:34:50):**  or half a billion cattle in India, you know, there's this huge opportunity to ensure that  
**[0:34:55-0:35:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:34:55):**  globally we can get the seaweed to these livestock and enable them to have this more, you know,  
**[0:35:03-0:35:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:35:03):**  this feed supplement that can be quite healthy for them as well.  
**[0:35:06-0:35:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:35:06):**  And just to shift gear because I would like to ask a few questions.  
**[0:35:09-0:35:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:35:09):**  What if and I will explain why I'm asking this question.  
**[0:35:13-0:35:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:35:13):**  You would wake up tomorrow instead of the metric want and the vegetarian diet or let's  
**[0:35:16-0:35:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:35:16):**  say the day after tomorrow and you'll be in charge of a one billion dollar investment portfolio.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:35:22):**  And I'm asking this because I see in the sector a lot of interest coming to region ag, a lot  
**[0:35:27-0:35:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:35:27):**  of interest coming to regeneration in general.  
**[0:35:29-0:35:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:35:29):**  And I think we should start getting used to larger numbers, larger numbers of hectares,  
**[0:35:34-0:35:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:35:34):**  larger numbers of square meters, larger number of acres and thus also larger amounts of investment  
**[0:35:40-0:35:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:35:40):**  capital.  
**[0:35:41-0:35:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:35:41):**  And I think as a sector, we need to get ready to absorb these kind of amounts and not be  
**[0:35:46-0:35:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:35:46):**  frightened by it because of these these phone calls and these amounts will try to enter  
**[0:35:50-0:35:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:35:50):**  this space.  
**[0:35:51-0:35:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:35:51):**  And then we need to find a way to put them to work to regenerate as much soil and see  
**[0:35:54-0:35:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:35:54):**  as possible.  
**[0:35:55-0:35:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:35:55):**  So that's a bit of background.  
**[0:35:57-0:36:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:35:57):**  If you would be in charge the day after tomorrow, where would you start investing?  
**[0:36:02-0:36:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:36:02):**  Of course, you can also do partly grant, but let's focus on the ones where you would like  
**[0:36:06-0:36:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:36:06):**  to have a financial return.  
**[0:36:08-0:36:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:36:08):**  What would you be doing?  
**[0:36:09-0:36:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:36:09):**  Well, I'll just provide some example that's close to home today in our development.  
**[0:36:14-0:36:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:36:14):**  It's cost, we can develop and build marine permacultures at per capital costs and parts  
**[0:36:20-0:36:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:36:20):**  that are on the order of $10 per square meter.  
**[0:36:22-0:36:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:36:22):**  But we have a roadmap to get us below $1 per square meter in the next few years.  
**[0:36:27-0:36:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:36:27):**  And as we bring the cost down of marine permaculture, it becomes less expensive to develop new kelp  
**[0:36:34-0:36:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:36:34):**  forest than it is to even buy farmland in Europe or the UK or perhaps even the US.  
**[0:36:40-0:36:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:36:40):**  So when you say costs, these are the pumps, the equipment, the platform to bring up this  
**[0:36:44-0:36:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:36:44):**  nutrient dense colder water from below.  
**[0:36:49-0:36:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:36:49):**  Correct.  
**[0:36:50-0:36:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:36:50):**  And also provide the substrate for the kelp forest and seaweed.  
**[0:36:53-0:36:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:36:53):**  And so once this happens that we get below $1 per square meter, then we're looking at  
**[0:36:58-0:37:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:36:58):**  less than a million dollars per square kilometer to develop these new permaculture facilities  
**[0:37:03-0:37:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:37:03):**  and infrastructure.  
**[0:37:04-0:37:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:37:04):**  And not only can that permaculture provide a seaweed bounty and fish habitat and ultimately  
**[0:37:10-0:37:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:37:10):**  a sustainable yield of fish, but it also cools off the mixed layer of the ocean.  
**[0:37:15-0:37:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:37:15):**  And that's enough to actually reverse coral bleaching.  
**[0:37:18-0:37:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:37:18):**  And we're looking at the 1300 kilometers of the Great Barrier Reef and currently applying  
**[0:37:23-0:37:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:37:23):**  for permits to test a small marine permaculture system that would not only grow seaweed, but  
**[0:37:27-0:37:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:37:27):**  would also cool off the reef and protect it from coral bleaching.  
**[0:37:30-0:37:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:37:30):**  Imagine if we could spend a billion in infrastructure to protect a $57 billion asset.  
**[0:37:36-0:37:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:37:36):**  And that is the Great Barrier Reef.  
**[0:37:39-0:37:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:37:39):**  Imagine if we could do that as one of several examples.  
**[0:37:42-0:37:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:37:42):**  Imagine if we could...  
**[0:37:43-0:37:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:37:43):**  Oh, go ahead.  
**[0:37:44-0:37:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:37:44):**  No, I was asking about actually several examples.  
**[0:37:46-0:37:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:37:46):**  Let's say you were forced by the trustees of the foundation or the bylaws of the investment  
**[0:37:53-0:37:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:37:53):**  fund to diversify.  
**[0:37:55-0:38:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:37:55):**  What would be a few others you've seen around or you see, okay, what other interesting roadmaps  
**[0:38:01-0:38:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:38:01):**  to get to those very interesting inflection points like the one you mentioned to get to  
**[0:38:04-0:38:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:38:04):**  under a dollar?  
**[0:38:06-0:38:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:38:06):**  What others do you see?  
**[0:38:07-0:38:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:38:07):**  Well, I think there's opportunities in regenerative agriculture where we move from our green revolution  
**[0:38:14-0:38:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:38:14):**  chemical understanding of the soil with NPK fertilizer and pH to the current generations  
**[0:38:21-0:38:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:38:21):**  biological understanding of soil microbial communities.  
**[0:38:24-0:38:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:38:24):**  And this is a place where the prebiotic of seaweed, petri dishes are made out of agar,  
**[0:38:29-0:38:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:38:29):**  agar is made out of seaweed.  
**[0:38:31-0:38:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:38:31):**  The seaweed is an incredible prebiotic for conditioning the soil to actually facilitate  
**[0:38:37-0:38:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:38:37):**  those soil microbial communities.  
**[0:38:39-0:38:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:38:39):**  And the regeneration of soil microbial communities is key to carbon farming, where we're able  
**[0:38:45-0:38:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:38:45):**  to utilize the biodiversity below the soil as well as the biodiversity above the soil  
**[0:38:52-0:38:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:38:52):**  to regenerate carbon fixation into our soils and potentially fix several gigatons of carbon  
**[0:38:57-0:38:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:38:57):**  globally per year into the soils.  
**[0:38:59-0:39:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:38:59):**  And I think this carbon farming regenerative agriculture is really key to move towards  
**[0:39:04-0:39:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:39:04):**  a deep biological understanding of the soil and how do we plant long roots and how do  
**[0:39:09-0:39:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:39:09):**  we facilitate the regeneration of the microbial communities that are responsible for fixing  
**[0:39:14-0:39:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:39:14):**  so much carbon and holding onto that carbon for decades in the soils themselves.  
**[0:39:20-0:39:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:39:20):**  And my final question, which usually ends up being a few more questions, but what do  
**[0:39:25-0:39:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:39:25):**  you believe to be true about regenerative agriculture or let's say regenerative food  
**[0:39:29-0:39:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:39:29):**  systems in general that others don't believe to be true?  
**[0:39:32-0:39:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:39:32):**  And this question is inspired by John Kempf, who usually asks it about agriculture in general,  
**[0:39:36-0:39:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:39:36):**  but I like to ask it about what do you believe to be true about region ag and food that others  
**[0:39:40-0:39:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:39:40):**  don't believe to be true?  
**[0:39:43-0:39:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:39:43):**  The permaculture design philosophy of adapting nature, I think is really key and moving from  
**[0:39:49-0:39:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:39:49):**  mono specific crops to silvopasturing, where we have trees and livestock, or multi-layer  
**[0:39:56-0:40:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:39:56):**  crops where we actually planted new crops over old crops and we've got winter cover  
**[0:40:01-0:40:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:40:01):**  crops.  
**[0:40:02-0:40:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:40:02):**  This is absolutely essential because 365 days a year, we want to have a living plant that  
**[0:40:09-0:40:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:40:09):**  is actually feeding the microbes in the soil.  
**[0:40:12-0:40:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:40:12):**  And so we have to move much more towards biodiversity.  
**[0:40:15-0:40:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:40:15):**  We look at partial harvesting of kelp forests as a key opportunity because the kelp supports  
**[0:40:21-0:40:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:40:21):**  dozens of species of epiphytes and even thousands of species of invertebrates and fish.  
**[0:40:26-0:40:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:40:26):**  And it's actually that interspecies interaction that has a profound effect.  
**[0:40:30-0:40:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:40:30):**  I'm reminded that in Hokkaido, Japan, they were harvesting nearly a million tons of herring  
**[0:40:35-0:40:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:40:35):**  every year from 1898 and for decades beyond that, until finally in 1953, the herring population  
**[0:40:43-0:40:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:40:43):**  collapsed and those herring went extinct.  
**[0:40:47-0:40:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:40:47):**  A few decades later, the Sakurina kelp forest also collapsed because it turns out the isotopic  
**[0:40:52-0:41:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:40:52):**  studies confirmed that the herring were fertilizing the Sakurina kelp forest, even at the same  
**[0:41:00-0:41:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:41:00):**  time that the Sakurina kelp forest was providing the nursery and the egg laying habitat for  
**[0:41:07-0:41:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:41:07):**  the herring.  
**[0:41:08-0:41:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:41:08):**  So it's this virtuous cycle of one ecosystem helping the other that we have to regenerate.  
**[0:41:14-0:41:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:41:14):**  And it's this understanding of the nutrient value chains and circular value chains in  
**[0:41:20-0:41:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:41:20):**  the life cycles of these ecosystems that is essential to our overall understanding.  
**[0:41:24-0:41:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:41:24):**  So I think we need to move agriculture more towards multi-species silvopasturing, intensive  
**[0:41:30-0:41:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:41:30):**  silvopasturing as described in Drawdown, and marine permaculture where we're going, yes,  
**[0:41:36-0:41:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:41:36):**  we harvest maybe one or two species, but we have so many more species living at the same  
**[0:41:41-0:41:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:41:41):**  time.  
**[0:41:42-0:41:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:41:42):**  And the predators are really our friends because they're helping to trim the crop.  
**[0:41:45-0:41:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:41:45):**  And so ultimately, the permaculture design philosophy is managing levels of predators  
**[0:41:51-0:41:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:41:51):**  and prey to build a multi-trophic ecosystem.  
**[0:41:54-0:41:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:41:54):**  And this integrated multi-trophic aquaculture is just one example.  
**[0:41:58-0:42:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:41:58):**  But I think moving towards the permaculture design philosophy is an opportunity in the  
**[0:42:02-0:42:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:42:02):**  soils as well as the seas.  
**[0:42:04-0:42:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:42:04):**  And what do you believe to be true in this sector?  
**[0:42:07-0:42:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:42:07):**  Because this is something that at least not in the broad agriculture sector, but at least  
**[0:42:11-0:42:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:42:11):**  in the region X space is getting quite known, the multi-species in time and place.  
**[0:42:16-0:42:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:42:16):**  Is there something that you believe to be true that others don't in the sector?  
**[0:42:22-0:42:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:42:22):**  Well in our carbon farming innovators network in the United States, there are probably five  
**[0:42:26-0:42:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:42:26):**  measures of soil quality, but they include biodiversity above the ground as well as biodiversity  
**[0:42:31-0:42:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:42:31):**  in the microbes below the ground and other soil organisms.  
**[0:42:36-0:42:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:42:36):**  It includes ensuring, well, by increasing this in the soil, we dramatically increase  
**[0:42:43-0:42:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:42:43):**  the water retention capacity of the soil.  
**[0:42:45-0:42:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:42:45):**  And there are several other measures as well that effectively enable the, it enables water  
**[0:42:53-0:42:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:42:53):**  retention in a way that doesn't exist otherwise.  
**[0:42:56-0:43:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:42:56):**  We've seen numerous examples in the US and Australia where a suitable biodynamic approach  
**[0:43:02-0:43:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:43:02):**  to rebuilding soil enables those soils to absorb five times as much water as a traditional  
**[0:43:12-0:43:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:43:12):**  green revolution soil, the compacted soil.  
**[0:43:15-0:43:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:43:15):**  And that is a profound effect.  
**[0:43:16-0:43:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:43:16):**  I think it's been said that, well, it's less about how much water necessarily falls on  
**[0:43:24-0:43:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:43:24):**  the soil as to what the soil does with the water.  
**[0:43:26-0:43:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:43:26):**  Is it able to absorb the water and how much?  
**[0:43:30-0:43:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:43:30):**  And Alan Savery, I think, has pioneered this work in Africa and also in the United States.  
**[0:43:35-0:43:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:43:35):**  And he loves to cite to that that when it does rain, we need to be able to absorb that  
**[0:43:40-0:43:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:43:40):**  rain.  
**[0:43:41-0:43:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:43:41):**  And that means effective soil management.  
**[0:43:43-0:43:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:43:43):**  So I think that's another key part of this is to really understand that contrary to traditional  
**[0:43:48-0:43:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:43:48):**  wisdom, silvopasturing involves rotating livestock across a crop in one or two days and then  
**[0:43:55-0:44:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:43:55):**  giving that green pasture, if you will, 30 days to recover.  
**[0:44:00-0:44:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:44:00):**  And then it grows even faster than it did before.  
**[0:44:02-0:44:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:44:02):**  This is part of the tenets of silvopasturing that move us toward an integrative approach  
**[0:44:07-0:44:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:44:07):**  that may include trees and shrubs and some livestock.  
**[0:44:11-0:44:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:44:11):**  And I think that achieving that balance at relatively low density is key.  
**[0:44:15-0:44:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:44:15):**  The other nontraditional wisdom, I think, is that we have an opportunity to do carbon  
**[0:44:20-0:44:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:44:20):**  negative dairy and carbon negative livestock.  
**[0:44:23-0:44:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:44:23):**  And I think it's one part seaweed and two parts rotational grazing and soil management.  
**[0:44:28-0:44:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:44:28):**  And I think within the next three to five years, we can achieve carbon negative dairy.  
**[0:44:33-0:44:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:44:33):**  And yes, we should perhaps have less meat in our diet and maybe manage the amount of  
**[0:44:38-0:44:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:44:38):**  dairy.  
**[0:44:39-0:44:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:44:39):**  But in 2030, we're still going to have meat and dairy.  
**[0:44:42-0:44:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:44:42):**  And the thing is, to bring that industry carbon negative would be transformative to the economics  
**[0:44:46-0:44:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:44:46):**  and the sustainability of those industries.  
**[0:44:49-0:44:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:44:49):**  And it literally is one part seaweed and two parts rotational soil management that can  
**[0:44:53-0:44:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:44:53):**  bring us to a carbon negative in money of these critical industries.

**[0:47:59-0:48:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:47:59):**  so you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:48:01-0:48:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:48:01):**  We're gonna look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:48:06-0:48:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:48:06):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:48:12-0:48:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:48:12):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[0:48:16-0:48:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:48:16):**  if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:48:18-0:48:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:48:18):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:48:23-0:48:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:48:23):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:48:27-0:48:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:48:27):**  We're gonna look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:48:31-0:48:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:48:31):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:48:32-0:48:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:48:32):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:48:34-0:48:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:48:34):**  Unfortunately, that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:48:37-0:48:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:48:37):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:48:40-0:48:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:48:40):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:48:43-0:48:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/01/09/brian-von-herzen/#t=0:48:43):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.

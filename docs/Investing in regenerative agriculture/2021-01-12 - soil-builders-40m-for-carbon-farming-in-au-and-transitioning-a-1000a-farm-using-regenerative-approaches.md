### Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food  (Tue, 12 Jan 2021 17:00:00)
## Soil Builders, 40M for carbon farming in AU and transitioning a 1000a farm using regenerative approaches  
**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  
**[0:00:05-0:00:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:00:05):**  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com or in the links below.  
**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:00:14):**  Welcome to Soil Builders, a series where we follow who is building soils at scale.  
**[0:00:19-0:00:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:00:19):**  This is an experiment, so please share any feedback.  
**[0:00:22-0:00:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:00:22):**  Why this show Soil Builders?  
**[0:00:23-0:00:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:00:23):**  I believe that most change in regenerative agriculture and food will come from and is  
**[0:00:27-0:00:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:00:27):**  coming from entrepreneurs building ways to regenerate soil at scale.  
**[0:00:32-0:00:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:00:32):**  I call these Soil Builders.  
**[0:00:34-0:00:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:00:34):**  Soil Builders are entrepreneurial farmers, agtech companies, investment funds, food  
**[0:00:37-0:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:00:37):**  startups, new seed cooperatives, teams within food companies, robot startups, investment  
**[0:00:42-0:00:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:00:42):**  vehicles etc. etc. etc.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:00:45):**  All regenerating soil beyond their own farm gate and with more than their own money.  
**[0:00:49-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:00:49):**  This series allows the community of the podcast, which is you, full of funders, investors and  
**[0:00:54-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:00:54):**  fellow soil builders to follow their progress, their challenges and their breakthroughs.  
**[0:00:58-0:01:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:00:58):**  I hope you enjoy it and please reach out with any comments, feedback and ideas.  
**[0:01:04-0:01:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:01:04):**  Today we check in with Lecci Ricci, co-founder of Ag Talent and the Carbon Farming Foundation,  
**[0:01:09-0:01:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:01:09):**  who is getting ready to spend 40 million to kickstart carbon farming in Australia.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:01:14):**  And we're checking in with Tyler and Tim Nuss, who are transitioning their 1000 acres  
**[0:01:18-0:01:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:01:18):**  row crop vegetable farm in California to regenerative approaches.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:01:22):**  But first up Lecci.  
**[0:01:24-0:01:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:01:24):**  Hi Lecci, long time no see.  
**[0:01:26-0:01:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:01:26):**  Lots has happened.  
**[0:01:27-0:01:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:01:27):**  Could you give us a short update on what has been happening over at Ag Talent since we  
**[0:01:31-0:01:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:01:31):**  last talked in November 19?  
**[0:01:34-0:01:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:01:34):**  And what is the Carbon Farming Foundation?  
**[0:01:36-0:01:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:01:36):**  Thanks Koen.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:01:37):**  Yeah, it has been a huge year for our team.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:01:40):**  So I'll keep it short and start in chronological order for you.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:01:44):**  Last time we spoke, Ag Talent was very squarely focused around jobs and training and recruitment  
**[0:01:51-0:01:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:01:51):**  in the regenerative agriculture niche.  
**[0:01:53-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:01:53):**  What we realized pretty quickly was that regenerative ag as an industry is still obviously a very  
**[0:02:00-0:02:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:02:00):**  small global niche, and that jobs and training alone wasn't going to be a big enough market  
**[0:02:06-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:02:06):**  segment for us as a business.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:02:09):**  So not too long after we spoke in November last year, we pivoted slightly and we expanded  
**[0:02:14-0:02:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:02:14):**  to become RegenFarming.news and we've started curating global news on regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:02:22):**  So we basically hunt the world every day for the best news in industry information that  
**[0:02:27-0:02:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:02:27):**  people need to know, and have started curating, summarizing and broadcasting that out.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:02:33):**  We're also started creating original content.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:02:35):**  We do pharma interviews and a range of other content pieces just really trying to spread  
**[0:02:41-0:02:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:02:41):**  knowledge about regenerative ag and become, I guess, that central focal point for people  
**[0:02:45-0:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:02:45):**  who are interested in getting started on the regenerative ag journey.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:02:50):**  We also have a business directory where businesses involved in regenerative agriculture can list  
**[0:02:56-0:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:02:56):**  themselves, promote themselves.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:02:58):**  And the other component is a global library of resources.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:03:02):**  So we have a searchable resource base of podcasts, videos, academic reports, studies, just all  
**[0:03:10-0:03:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:03:10):**  this kind of information that people might be looking for in regenerative ag.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:03:14):**  So we pivoted to this, I guess, broader regenerative farming central platform for the world.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:03:20):**  And it's been really successful.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:03:22):**  Traffic has boosted massively.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:03:25):**  I mean, obviously, everyone experienced the challenges around COVID.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:03:29):**  Oh, and that was obviously a huge impact on our business.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:03:33):**  There wasn't a lot of people willing to spend money on advertising at the time.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:03:37):**  So I mean, we've been able to ride through that pretty well just because as a small startup,  
**[0:03:41-0:03:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:03:41):**  costs are low.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:03:42):**  So we're riding along pretty well through that.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:03:45):**  And what we've experienced is, I guess, a huge boom towards the agricultural community  
**[0:03:51-0:03:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:03:51):**  moving online.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:03:52):**  We've had a lot of agronomists in particular who previously spent a lot of time traveling  
**[0:03:57-0:04:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:03:57):**  interstate or even internationally to deliver services.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:04:00):**  And now they're all...  
**[0:04:01-0:04:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:04:01):**  Same goes for training providers.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:04:03):**  Now they're all scrambling to be online.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:04:06):**  So we've had a lot of interest in them.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:04:09):**  And one of the new features that we're building on Regen Farming News is online coaching.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:04:13):**  So allowing agronomists to basically coach people without having to travel, either in  
**[0:04:19-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:04:19):**  a group setting, which the idea would be you might have a small group of, say, 10 people  
**[0:04:23-0:04:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:04:23):**  with one agronomist coach, which brings the cost down for everyone.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:04:27):**  And of course, also doing one-on-one coaching online.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:04:31):**  Now none of this will ever replace face-to-face, we all know that.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:04:34):**  But the idea is that it might augment and support face-to-face.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:04:38):**  So yes, we've had big changes, and things are all tracking along really well.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:04:43):**  But I guess the biggest piece of news is that our business has been acquired by a newly  
**[0:04:49-0:04:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:04:49):**  established carbon farming foundation.  
**[0:04:52-0:05:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:04:52):**  So basically, carbon farming foundation was started off the back of a very generous philanthropic  
**[0:05:00-0:05:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:05:00):**  pledge from a gentleman named Norman Padder and his family to contribute $40 million over  
**[0:05:07-0:05:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:05:07):**  10 years to kickstart or I guess boost the carbon farming industry within Australia.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:05:14):**  So the aims of the foundation are twofold.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:05:18):**  It's to support farmers to reduce their carbon footprints.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:05:22):**  Because as we know, agriculture is one of the largest emitting industries as a whole.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:05:27):**  So one side of it is this emission reduction focus.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:05:31):**  And then the other side of the foundation is focusing on carbon sequestration through  
**[0:05:36-0:05:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:05:36):**  generating carbon credit units, either through revegetation or soil carbon is a main initial  
**[0:05:42-0:05:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:05:42):**  two focus methods.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:05:44):**  And I mean, really, the foundation is newly formed October 2020.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:05:48):**  And I'll be heading up the foundation.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:05:51):**  And basically, the Regen Farming News team will all fold into the foundation and keep  
**[0:05:55-0:05:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:05:55):**  operating as Regen Farming News.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:05:58):**  Now, the foundation is a not for profit.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:06:04):**  So it just basically means that our business is now effectively fully owned by a not for  
**[0:06:09-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:06:09):**  profit, it'll still run as a for profit business, but all proceeds or profit basically fold  
**[0:06:15-0:06:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:06:15):**  into the not for profit, and it's broad emission.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:06:18):**  Yeah, so it's big news for us.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:06:22):**  So why did you decide to fold Act Talent and Regen Farming News into the Carbon Foundation  
**[0:06:27-0:06:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:06:27):**  instead of simply between brackets, raising capital for Act Talent and Regen Farming News  
**[0:06:31-0:06:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:06:31):**  and continuing to scale and grow that business?  
**[0:06:34-0:06:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:06:34):**  It's a really good question.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:06:36):**  The main decision for us to fold into the Carbon Farming Foundation, and I guess, as  
**[0:06:42-0:06:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:06:42):**  founders of Regen Farming News, we had put a lot of heart and soul over many years into  
**[0:06:48-0:06:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:06:48):**  a startup unpaid as everyone does.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:06:51):**  And I guess, you're doing that in the hope that one day, there might be an equity position  
**[0:06:55-0:06:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:06:55):**  for you, obviously.  
**[0:06:57-0:07:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:06:57):**  But for us, the main motivator to merge with the Carbon Farming Foundation and give up  
**[0:07:03-0:07:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:07:03):**  all of our shareholders, it really came down to impact.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:07:07):**  We obviously started Regen Farming News to try and support the growth of regenerative  
**[0:07:12-0:07:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:07:12):**  agriculture as a whole.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:07:14):**  That was firmly a mission oriented startup.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:07:18):**  And I guess when the opportunity comes along to dedicate a $40 million philanthropic contribution  
**[0:07:25-0:07:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:07:25):**  to the thing you care most about in the world, it's pretty hard to walk away from that opportunity.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:07:30):**  So whilst Regen Farming News would have kept chugging along as a startup, and it was growing  
**[0:07:36-0:07:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:07:36):**  nicely, slowly, but steadily, and was looking really positive, I think, yeah, the main thing  
**[0:07:42-0:07:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:07:42):**  for us was that with $40 million behind us, we can really boost the impact of what Regen  
**[0:07:48-0:07:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:07:48):**  Farming News as a platform could do.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:07:51):**  And it also means that Regen Farming News now becomes a piece of a bigger puzzle that  
**[0:07:56-0:08:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:07:56):**  we can tackle with the broader Carbon Farming Foundation.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:08:00):**  So the foundation strategy is still getting better down, but it's got some pretty exciting  
**[0:08:05-0:08:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:08:05):**  projects on the horizon.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:08:07):**  We are going to look at, for example, supporting a greenhouse gas measurement tool.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:08:13):**  So there are a number of those that are on the market in different parts of the world,  
**[0:08:17-0:08:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:08:17):**  but we will help to see something commercialized in Australia that allows farmers to measure  
**[0:08:23-0:08:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:08:23):**  their greenhouse gas footprint.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:08:24):**  And we think that can be huge to help with behavior change and capacity building for  
**[0:08:30-0:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:08:30):**  farmers to help change the way they're managing the land to reduce emissions in the first  
**[0:08:34-0:08:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:08:34):**  instance.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:08:35):**  Now, longer term, that could obviously also feed into supporting carbon farming projects  
**[0:08:41-0:08:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:08:41):**  by giving, you know, if the tool was expanded to be able to measure soil carbon changes.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:08:45):**  So there's a lot going on.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:08:47):**  So that's one piece of the puzzle.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:08:49):**  The other thing that we're going to be looking at is investing in large scale commercial  
**[0:08:54-0:09:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:08:54):**  demonstrations of carbon farming done in a holistic mosaic approach.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:09:01):**  One of the things we're trying to avoid with carbon farming as an industry is the tendency  
**[0:09:06-0:09:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:09:06):**  to buy big blocks of farmland and plant a whole lot to trees and effectively take out  
**[0:09:12-0:09:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:09:12):**  large areas from agricultural production.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:09:15):**  We don't see that as the future of carbon farming.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:09:17):**  We see the future of carbon farming being a more mosaic type approach where carbon farming  
**[0:09:24-0:09:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:09:24):**  components, be those tree carbon or soil carbon, are integrated in a patchwork in and around  
**[0:09:31-0:09:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:09:31):**  productive, regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:09:34):**  And the other component is that we think that, especially currently with the carbon farming  
**[0:09:39-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:09:39):**  bus over the carbon credit price in Australia, is that a carbon credit payment alone is not  
**[0:09:46-0:09:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:09:46):**  enough of an incentive for a farmer to change land use on part of their land.  
**[0:09:51-0:09:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:09:51):**  So we'll be looking at how do you layer up the different values for a farmer, be that  
**[0:09:58-0:10:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:09:58):**  can you get them a higher price for their food?  
**[0:10:00-0:10:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:10:00):**  Can you get them green finance to reduce the cost of debt?  
**[0:10:05-0:10:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:10:05):**  And then can you get them certified carbon neutral, for example?  
**[0:10:09-0:10:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:10:09):**  And then the carbon credit payment?  
**[0:10:11-0:10:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:10:11):**  And then is there a possibility for other market payments for ecosystem services more  
**[0:10:16-0:10:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:10:16):**  broadly?  
**[0:10:17-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:10:17):**  So what we'll basically be doing is investing in large scale pilot projects around the country  
**[0:10:22-0:10:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:10:22):**  where we try and develop out and prove these models.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:10:26):**  And then we will open source all of our lessons from a financial perspective to, oh, it's  
**[0:10:31-0:10:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:10:31):**  really hard to get seedlings to plant trees.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:10:34):**  So we'll look at what's going on in the industry as a whole and identify the major bottlenecks,  
**[0:10:40-0:10:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:10:40):**  share these problems, and then we'll call for people to come up with solutions to some  
**[0:10:45-0:10:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:10:45):**  of these bottlenecks in the carbon farming value chain.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:10:49):**  And then we may invest in those or launch other projects and initiatives.  
**[0:10:54-0:10:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:10:54):**  So the strategy is still unfolding, but that gives you a little bit of a taste of what  
**[0:10:59-0:11:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:10:59):**  the foundation will do with its generous endowment.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:11:04):**  And how can listeners of the podcast help?  
**[0:11:06-0:11:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:11:06):**  Yeah, we would love the help of all the listeners.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:11:09):**  And at this early stage, really just keeping in touch with what's happening with Regen  
**[0:11:13-0:11:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:11:13):**  Farming News is a really good place to start.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:11:16):**  Moving forward, the broader foundation as a whole will be seeking impact investment  
**[0:11:23-0:11:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:11:23):**  from philanthropically minded donors.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:11:26):**  So as we learn more about carbon farming projects, develop more projects, we will be structuring  
**[0:11:31-0:11:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:11:31):**  different types of investment vehicles with varying risk return profiles to suit different  
**[0:11:38-0:11:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:11:38):**  impact investment hurdle rates.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:11:40):**  So as that all develops, we'll certainly be presenting opportunities for investment.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:11:46):**  As a tax deductible not for profit foundation, we will also be seeking donations, philanthropy,  
**[0:11:54-0:11:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:11:54):**  blended finance.  
**[0:11:55-0:12:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:11:55):**  So anyone who is interested in supporting the growth of the carbon farming industry  
**[0:12:00-0:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:12:00):**  in Australia, we'd love to hear from you.

**[0:12:04-0:12:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:12:04):**  The best way to stay in touch is to subscribe currently to RegenFarming.News.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:12:11):**  We have a wonderful weekly newsletter that presents updates of everything going on in  
**[0:12:16-0:12:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:12:16):**  the world of regenerative ag.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:12:18):**  We scour the internet for the best news to save you having to do it.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:12:22):**  And then through that same channel, we will broadcast updates about the Carbon Farming  
**[0:12:27-0:12:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:12:27):**  Foundation, various initiatives, projects, opportunities to get involved and support  
**[0:12:32-0:12:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:12:32):**  the growth of the carbon farming industry as a whole.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:12:36):**  And look that will include the opportunity to purchase or forward contract for really  
**[0:12:41-0:12:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:12:41):**  high quality carbon credit units.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:12:43):**  So we will be producing carbon credit units with additional co-benefits for biodiversity  
**[0:12:49-0:12:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:12:49):**  outcomes, our social impact outcomes and other ecological outcomes.  
**[0:12:55-0:12:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:12:55):**  So there'll be a lot going on with the foundation as we find our feet.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:12:59):**  We're brand new, but 2021 will be a big founding year for us.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:13:04):**  So yeah, please stay in touch.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:13:07):**  And next up a deep dive into a farm in transition with Tyler and Tim, who have an amazing podcast  
**[0:13:13-0:13:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:13:13):**  as well called The Modern Farmer.  
**[0:13:16-0:13:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:13:16):**  We're using the regenerative agriculture continuum framework of Ethan Soloveev, which we'll link  
**[0:13:20-0:13:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:13:20):**  below if you want to know more.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:13:22):**  Basically it looks at regen as not a destination, but a continuum from degenerative practices  
**[0:13:26-0:13:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:13:26):**  and approaches to regenerative practices and approaches.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:13:29):**  It doesn't help asking a farmer, are you regenerative?  
**[0:13:32-0:13:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:13:32):**  But it helps asking what regenerative approaches are you applying and what would you like to  
**[0:13:36-0:13:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:13:36):**  change in the future?  
**[0:13:37-0:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:13:37):**  And that's exactly what we're doing here.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:13:39):**  Enjoy.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:13:40):**  The framework uses different questions divided in characteristics like resilience, economic  
**[0:13:45-0:13:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:13:45):**  sustainability, inputs, fuel, fertilizer, seeds, animals, et cetera, and practices slash  
**[0:13:49-0:13:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:13:49):**  approaches tillage, pest and disease.  
**[0:13:52-0:13:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:13:52):**  Could you please describe briefly your farm, where you are, what's your size, what are  
**[0:13:55-0:13:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:13:55):**  you farming and since when you and your family have been connected to this land?  
**[0:13:59-0:14:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:13:59):**  Yeah, this is Tim.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:14:01):**  Thanks for having us, Kon.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:14:02):**  Our family, Nuss Farms, farms in Northern California in a town called Lodi, which is  
**[0:14:06-0:14:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:14:06):**  about an hour and a half east of the San Francisco Bay Area.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:14:10):**  We farm about a thousand acres of row crop specialty vegetables.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:14:14):**  Tyler and I both represent the fifth generation of a farming family.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:14:17):**  This particular ranch that we're farming, we farm for close to 50 years.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:14:21):**  Yeah.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:14:22):**  So this is Tyler.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:14:23):**  Tim and I grew up in and around agriculture and being on the farm doing odd jobs growing  
**[0:14:29-0:14:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:14:29):**  up and we both actually went away from the farm to develop our careers.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:14:33):**  Tim studied international business and got into the produce industry, did category management,  
**[0:14:39-0:14:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:14:39):**  import and export of produce across the globe, and most recently has been involved in a few  
**[0:14:45-0:14:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:14:45):**  ad tech startups and is currently at Appeal Sciences working in supplier relations.  
**[0:14:51-0:14:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:14:51):**  My background is in engineering.  
**[0:14:53-0:15:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:14:53):**  I got into the tech industry several years ago working for Apple in supply chain operations,  
**[0:15:00-0:15:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:15:00):**  supporting the iPhone, iPad programs, and most recently I work in an electric car startup  
**[0:15:05-0:15:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:15:05):**  called Rivian supporting commercial operations, things like retail, service, digital commerce.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:15:12):**  But a few years ago, Tim and I became more interested in what was happening back at the  
**[0:15:15-0:15:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:15:15):**  family farm, talking to our dad, talking to our oldest brother.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:15:19):**  And as we started talking and researching about what was happening in the industry,  
**[0:15:22-0:15:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:15:22):**  we felt like there wasn't a great place for the next generation to really learn and connect  
**[0:15:27-0:15:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:15:27):**  from one another.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:15:28):**  So we actually started a podcast of our own called The Modern Acre, where we interview  
**[0:15:32-0:15:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:15:32):**  people all around the ag industry on and off the farm, entrepreneurs, founders, thought  
**[0:15:39-0:15:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:15:39):**  leaders, farmers, and really learn from what they're doing and how they're growing and  
**[0:15:43-0:15:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:15:43):**  scaling their businesses.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:15:45):**  And along that journey, we've been doing the podcast now for almost three years.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:15:49):**  We've become much more actively involved in our farm's operation and through the podcast  
**[0:15:54-0:15:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:15:54):**  really learned more about regenerative agriculture and have been transitioning the farm over  
**[0:15:59-0:16:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:15:59):**  the past year or so.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:16:01):**  Looking at the economic sustainability of the farm, how would you describe your current  
**[0:16:04-0:16:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:16:04):**  situation and where would you like to see it in five to 10 years?  
**[0:16:07-0:16:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:16:07):**  Well, it's actually an interesting story.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:16:10):**  The economic sustainability of the farm has been quite a journey.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:16:15):**  About 15, 20 years ago, our farm really heavily invested in the asparagus industry.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:16:22):**  It was a huge crop in the Central Valley of California.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:16:25):**  In fact, one of the adjacent towns Stockton had an annual asparagus festival.  
**[0:16:29-0:16:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:16:29):**  So it was a huge part of the culture and the economic sustainability of the area.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:16:34):**  Our dad made a decision to really double down on that crop.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:16:38):**  We invested heavily in infrastructure and equipment.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:16:41):**  And as we scaled up, we became more vertically integrated grower, packer, shipper.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:16:46):**  We actually exported to Japan, had a Japanese label.  
**[0:16:50-0:16:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:16:50):**  But then a series of events happened to really hurt the business.  
**[0:16:54-0:17:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:16:54):**  One was NAFTA, the trade agreement that was agreed to that really shifted production of  
**[0:17:00-0:17:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:17:00):**  asparagus in large part to Mexico and South America.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:17:04):**  And number two was just the ongoing labor challenges that you talk a lot about on the  
**[0:17:09-0:17:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:17:09):**  podcast, especially in California.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:17:12):**  And three was we actually had a series of arson fires that took out our offices on the  
**[0:17:18-0:17:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:17:18):**  farm.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:17:19):**  It was just a crazy sequence of events that happened.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:17:21):**  We were just kids and our dad was managing to figure out how to handle all that.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:17:26):**  But that really hurt the business.  
**[0:17:28-0:17:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:17:28):**  From there, our dad and our oldest brother really had to rethink the business and build  
**[0:17:33-0:17:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:17:33):**  it back from scratch with very little working capital to do so.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:17:37):**  So the past decade or so has been our oldest brother and our dad working their way back  
**[0:17:43-0:17:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:17:43):**  to profitability by slowly and incrementally improving the deals, the contracts that we  
**[0:17:48-0:17:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:17:48):**  have on the farm.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:17:49):**  So going from things like corn, which is a lower value crop, to things like garlic and  
**[0:17:54-0:17:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:17:54):**  tomatoes and cucumbers.  
**[0:17:56-0:17:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:17:56):**  And so that's where we sit today as a profitable operation.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:17:59):**  But as Tim and I became a little bit more involved and interested in where the direction  
**[0:18:03-0:18:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:18:03):**  of the farm was going, our dad was actually involved in an equipment accident on the farm  
**[0:18:08-0:18:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:18:08):**  where he broke every rib in his body.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:18:10):**  And it was a pretty scary moment for us as a family.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:18:13):**  He thankfully has made a full recovery, but it was a really big turning point for us as  
**[0:18:17-0:18:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:18:17):**  a family because we had to look at each other and decide what we were going to do with the  
**[0:18:21-0:18:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:18:21):**  farm and where was the farm going in the next five to 10 years.  
**[0:18:24-0:18:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:18:24):**  And so it was around this time where we were learning about regenerative agriculture and  
**[0:18:27-0:18:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:18:27):**  how that could be a solution and provide not just a direction, but a vision for the farm.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:18:33):**  And so we're profitable today, but with our transition to regenerative agriculture, we  
**[0:18:37-0:18:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:18:37):**  hope to not only be more profitable, but also increase revenue with some of the different  
**[0:18:43-0:18:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:18:43):**  business approaches we're doing.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:18:45):**  In terms of ecological sustainability, when you look at the level of degradation in your  
**[0:18:49-0:18:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:18:49):**  ecosystem, where do you stand now?  
**[0:18:51-0:18:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:18:51):**  Where did you stand when you started farming and where do you plan to go in 10 years?  
**[0:18:56-0:19:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:18:56):**  So historically we've been a conventional farm, farming conventionally for quite a few  
**[0:19:00-0:19:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:19:00):**  years.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:19:01):**  We've always strived to do well by our soil and crop rotations have been a part of our  
**[0:19:05-0:19:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:19:05):**  process for a very long time, as well as conservation easements to enhance the land for wildlife  
**[0:19:10-0:19:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:19:10):**  and that kind of thing.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:19:11):**  But really going forward, we want to really double down on regenerative and start incorporating  
**[0:19:15-0:19:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:19:15):**  these practices at scale by introducing cover crops, by reducing our tillage and also reducing  
**[0:19:20-0:19:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:19:20):**  synthetic inputs over time.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:19:22):**  So we've made a number of pretty big moves here in 2020, doing our first livestock integration  
**[0:19:27-0:19:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:19:27):**  and planting pasture, really doing our first cover crops at scale at the end of this year,  
**[0:19:32-0:19:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:19:32):**  and also looking at different ways we can no-till plants coming spring.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:19:36):**  How is the level of diversity on the farm and where would you like to take it?  
**[0:19:40-0:19:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:19:40):**  Yeah, this is Tyler.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:19:41):**  I think this is actually one area that we've done really well in our existing conventional  
**[0:19:47-0:19:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:19:47):**  system, but I think we want to double down and really lean into that because it is something  
**[0:19:51-0:19:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:19:51):**  we do well.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:19:52):**  We're a grower of annual crops, so having a diverse rotational system is something that  
**[0:19:59-0:20:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:19:59):**  we're super accustomed to.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:20:01):**  So take a given field, one year it could be garlic, the next year cucumbers, the next  
**[0:20:05-0:20:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:20:05):**  year tomatoes.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:20:06):**  And we think there's a ton of advantages of that, but in terms of scaling regenerative  
**[0:20:10-0:20:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:20:10):**  agriculture, it really hasn't been done at this scale, in the 100 to 1000 acre range  
**[0:20:17-0:20:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:20:17):**  of how to figure out how to manage everything from planting to weed control to harvesting  
**[0:20:24-0:20:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:20:24):**  to off-season cover crops.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:20:26):**  And that's really what we're working through right now to figure out how to do that.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:20:30):**  Another thing that we're incorporating into this annual rotation is the livestock integration  
**[0:20:36-0:20:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:20:36):**  that Tim alluded to.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:20:37):**  So we're partnering with a company called Pasture Bird, and we're actually doing something  
**[0:20:41-0:20:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:20:41):**  that I think is quite unique in the space of incorporating what we call a rotational  
**[0:20:46-0:20:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:20:46):**  pasture.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:20:47):**  So instead of garlic, tomatoes, or cucumbers being in a given field, we're actually dedicating  
**[0:20:51-0:20:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:20:51):**  100 acres of our farm to pasture raised poultry.  
**[0:20:56-0:21:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:20:56):**  So this will incorporate movable coops that will move to a fresh patch of pasture every  
**[0:21:01-0:21:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:21:01):**  day and methodically and systematically move through the field and almost supercharge the  
**[0:21:07-0:21:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:21:07):**  field in terms of soil health.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:21:09):**  So that's going to be another piece of this whole puzzle is moving this rotational pasture  
**[0:21:14-0:21:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:21:14):**  throughout the farm, supercharging the soil, and then after we rotate out of the pasture,  
**[0:21:19-0:21:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:21:19):**  going back in with vegetables, which is pretty exciting, especially as it relates to tracking  
**[0:21:25-0:21:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:21:25):**  those changes in soil health and nutrient density over time.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:21:29):**  Another thing we've also done is really doubled down on our R&D trials and really try to experiment  
**[0:21:33-0:21:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:21:33):**  and explore with what new varieties we can be bringing into commercial production, testing  
**[0:21:38-0:21:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:21:38):**  things like radishes, horseradish, different kinds of squash, peppers, a lot of different  
**[0:21:43-0:21:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:21:43):**  things that we're trialing at small scale to see how we can work those into our regenerative  
**[0:21:47-0:21:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:21:47):**  system in the future.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:21:48):**  So when thinking about resilience on the farm, what comes to mind?  
**[0:21:52-0:21:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:21:52):**  Definitely starting with the soil, I think our focus on the soil here going forward is  
**[0:21:55-0:22:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:21:55):**  going to make us resilient to a couple different factors, reducing our reliance on traditional  
**[0:22:00-0:22:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:22:00):**  inputs and weaning ourselves off those over time where it makes sense, and also building  
**[0:22:05-0:22:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:22:05):**  up the organic matter in the soil to mitigate against certain weather instances and lack  
**[0:22:10-0:22:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:22:10):**  of rainfall where we have moisture captured in the soil that can help us navigate certain  
**[0:22:14-0:22:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:22:14):**  events better than without it.  
**[0:22:15-0:22:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:22:15):**  Yeah.  
**[0:22:16-0:22:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:22:16):**  And another thing, when I think about resilience, I also think about business resilience and  
**[0:22:21-0:22:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:22:21):**  something that Tim and I are really trying to do is optimize the business.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:22:26):**  So we're focused on improving the sales channels in a few different ways.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:22:32):**  One is we want to be the premier regenerative ingredient producer of vegetables and specialty  
**[0:22:38-0:22:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:22:38):**  crops.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:22:39):**  So we really want to market ourselves as being able to provide high volume, regeneratively  
**[0:22:43-0:22:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:22:43):**  grown ingredients to food brands that are really interested in this space and connecting  
**[0:22:49-0:22:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:22:49):**  with consumers and working directly with farms.  
**[0:22:52-0:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:22:52):**  We're actually doing that today with a few different food brands and talking about how  
**[0:22:56-0:23:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:22:56):**  we can work together and navigate the supply chain.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:23:00):**  That's really where the focus of the business is going.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:23:02):**  But also we're exploring a few different other areas of really getting closer to the consumer.  
**[0:23:07-0:23:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:23:07):**  So one area we're doing that is by produce box delivery.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:23:10):**  So we just started doing that this year, shipping some of our specialty crops.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:23:15):**  We trialed some row seven seed squash varieties and we're shipping those through a company  
**[0:23:21-0:23:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:23:21):**  called Fruitstand.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:23:22):**  So anyone in the US could actually order a Nesfarm squash box directly to their door.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:23:28):**  So that's super exciting for us and fun to connect directly with people that care about  
**[0:23:33-0:23:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:23:33):**  how their food is grown and where their food is coming from.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:23:36):**  And then lastly, we're also developing a brand focused on regenerative agriculture, a brand  
**[0:23:43-0:23:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:23:43):**  that sources their ingredients directly from regenerative farmers.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:23:47):**  And so we're going to be sharing more about that in the months to come, but we're trialing  
**[0:23:51-0:23:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:23:51):**  a product, doing product development today.  
**[0:23:54-0:24:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:23:54):**  And we really want to be a leader in the CPG space and be one of the first and biggest  
**[0:24:00-0:24:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:24:00):**  regenerative brands out there.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:24:02):**  So that's another key area of the business.  
**[0:24:05-0:24:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:24:05):**  And when we think about resilience, it's about having business diversity and being able to  
**[0:24:10-0:24:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:24:10):**  have different revenue streams.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:24:11):**  And so you're not dependent on that one deal or that one contract.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:24:15):**  We really want to go in that direction.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:24:18):**  What waste and pollution does the farm currently produce and how are you planning to work with  
**[0:24:22-0:24:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:24:22):**  that in the future?  
**[0:24:23-0:24:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:24:23):**  A couple of things come to mind here.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:24:24):**  First one being fuel, obviously the diesel to get the tractors moving around the farm.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:24:29):**  So I don't see us moving away from that very quickly.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:24:32):**  But there is some developments happening in the space.  
**[0:24:34-0:24:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:24:34):**  We've talked to a number of companies like Monarch tractor and Z tractor, small robot  
**[0:24:38-0:24:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:24:38):**  company that are all doing some really interesting things in the space where we see a really  
**[0:24:42-0:24:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:24:42):**  viable path there in the future to start replacing kind of the traditional tractor with zero  
**[0:24:46-0:24:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:24:46):**  emission vehicles.  
**[0:24:48-0:24:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:24:48):**  Another thing that I think about when I think about waste is water waste and irrigation  
**[0:24:51-0:24:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:24:51):**  on the farm.  
**[0:24:52-0:24:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:24:52):**  We do it a number of different ways, but one of the primary ways is flood irrigation, which  
**[0:24:55-0:24:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:24:55):**  isn't the most effective.  
**[0:24:57-0:25:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:24:57):**  So in the future, looking at ways where we can incorporate overhead sprinklers as well  
**[0:25:01-0:25:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:25:01):**  as drip irrigation, obviously those come with a pretty big cost.  
**[0:25:04-0:25:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:25:04):**  So that's kind of what we're balancing, weighing the investment to improve the water infrastructure  
**[0:25:09-0:25:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:25:09):**  versus the present state.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:25:11):**  What kind of crops or produce are you currently farming and how do you see that changing over  
**[0:25:15-0:25:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:25:15):**  the next years?  
**[0:25:16-0:25:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:25:16):**  This is Tyler.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:25:18):**  Currently we're growing garlic, tomatoes, cucumbers, sunflowers, wheat, and we're also  
**[0:25:26-0:25:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:25:26):**  doing the pastured poultry integration that I talked about.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:25:29):**  In addition, we're doing the trials of specialty vegetables and unique varieties.  
**[0:25:34-0:25:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:25:34):**  And I think what's important to mention is because we're in an annual crop system, we  
**[0:25:39-0:25:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:25:39):**  have a lot of flexibility with what we can grow and introduce.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:25:43):**  And so it gets me really excited talking to some of these food brands that I mentioned  
**[0:25:48-0:25:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:25:48):**  and learning about their ingredient needs and how we could fill those.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:25:52):**  So I think in the future, we are definitely open and interested to evolving our rotation  
**[0:25:57-0:25:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:25:57):**  and what we put into the ground.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:25:59):**  And so definitely excited by that prospect.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:26:01):**  But I can tell you in 2021, we'll probably have an increased number of peppers, doing  
**[0:26:05-0:26:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:26:05):**  a few different varieties of peppers, which we're excited about.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:26:08):**  Yeah, definitely like our ability to iterate quickly year over year and trial and experiment  
**[0:26:13-0:26:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:26:13):**  with new things, especially being able to double and sometimes triple crop.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:26:16):**  Like a lot of these crops that we're looking at, radishes are a 30 day crop, cucumbers  
**[0:26:20-0:26:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:26:20):**  are a 60 day crop.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:26:21):**  So you do have the ability to cycle numerous crops off the same field in a given year and  
**[0:26:26-0:26:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:26:26):**  really incorporate that crop rotation and build the soil health.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:26:29):**  Where do you source your inputs from?  
**[0:26:31-0:26:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:26:31):**  International, regional, local, or on the farm?  
**[0:26:34-0:26:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:26:34):**  So we primarily source our inputs pretty traditional here in California, sourcing from a multinational  
**[0:26:39-0:26:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:26:39):**  ag retailer.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:26:40):**  One of the large guys that has a local regional presence, which obviously offers us a level  
**[0:26:45-0:26:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:26:45):**  of service being close and local, being able to get us product when we need it on time  
**[0:26:49-0:26:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:26:49):**  and have the distribution and capabilities to do so.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:26:52):**  That's really a main reason why a lot of farms are still on this model where there's such  
**[0:26:56-0:27:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:26:56):**  a level of high service, high touch to facilitate what's happening on the farm.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:27:00):**  But we are looking in the future of ways that we can incorporate biologicals and not be  
**[0:27:05-0:27:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:27:05):**  so reliant on synthetics.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:27:07):**  Obviously as we build our soil, the rates are going to come down, the resilience against  
**[0:27:10-0:27:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:27:10):**  pests and weed pressures are going to come down naturally.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:27:13):**  So we're still looking at that as our North Star, but still in the traditional model as  
**[0:27:16-0:27:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:27:16):**  it relates to procuring inputs.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:27:07):**  Yeah, I think we view it as a balance, right?  
**[0:27:21-0:27:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:27:21):**  It's something that needs to happen over time.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:27:22):**  But something about the traditional model is the PCAs we work with, the retailers we  
**[0:27:27-0:27:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:27:27):**  work with aren't incentivized, right, to reduce our inputs over time.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:27:31):**  That's how they make their money.  
**[0:27:32-0:28:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:27:32):**  And so trying to balance that and work with them to reduce our inputs over time is something  
**[0:28:02-0:28:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:28:02):**  that we're really looking at.  
**[0:28:32-0:29:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:28:32):**  Yeah.  
**[0:29:02-0:29:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:29:02):**  Yeah.  
**[0:29:32-0:30:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/soil-builders-4/#t=0:29:32):**  Yeah.

**[0:00:12-0:00:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:00:13):**  Can we apply the principles of regenerative agriculture, diversity, we are part of nature,  
**[0:00:18-0:00:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:00:18):**  learning from nature with biomimicry and the focus on life, to technology?  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:00:22):**  And what would this regenerative technology look like beyond food and agriculture?  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:00:27):**  And can we apply these principles to more touchy subjects like cellular egg or plant-based  
**[0:00:31-0:00:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:00:31):**  proteins?  
**[0:00:32-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:00:32):**  Enjoy this interview where we dive deep into these topics.  
**[0:00:38-0:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:00:38):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture, Investing as if  
**[0:00:42-0:00:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:00:42):**  the Planet Mattered, a podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative  
**[0:00:46-0:00:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:00:46):**  food and agriculture space to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate  
**[0:00:51-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:00:51):**  soil, people, local communities and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:58-0:01:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:00:58):**  Why my focus on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:00-0:01:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:01:00):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:04-0:01:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:01:04):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:01:07):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:11-0:01:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:01:11):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.

**[0:01:40-0:01:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:01:40):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:42-0:01:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:01:42):**  Welcome to another episode today with the founder and managing partner of Regen Ventures.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:01:47):**  Welcome Dan.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:01:48):**  Great to be with you, Con.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:01:49):**  To start with a personal question, you have a very interesting background story, basically,  
**[0:01:53-0:01:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:01:53):**  and journey.  
**[0:01:54-0:01:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:01:54):**  But I would love to unpack that a bit.  
**[0:01:55-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:01:55):**  How did you end up focusing on regenerative technology, soil, food and much more than  
**[0:02:00-0:02:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:02:00):**  that?  
**[0:02:01-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:02:01):**  Yeah, I guess I have a pretty nonlinear background, started in investment banking and finance  
**[0:02:07-0:02:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:02:07):**  and derivatives trading of all things, managed a hedge fund.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:02:10):**  Wow.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:02:11):**  And I guess I realized I was contributing very little positive to the world, but understood  
**[0:02:17-0:02:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:02:17):**  the financial markets and wanted to utilize those skills in a more positive way.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:02:21):**  So started angel investing in some great companies in recycling and food waste, alternative proteins,  
**[0:02:28-0:02:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:02:28):**  joined a family office and was able to help them build out a strategy across their entire  
**[0:02:33-0:02:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:02:33):**  portfolio around impact.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:02:35):**  And then two years ago, began the journey of building Regen Ventures, which is a global  
**[0:02:41-0:02:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:02:41):**  early stage venture capital firm that partners with founders daring to build companies that  
**[0:02:46-0:02:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:02:46):**  will restore our planet.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:02:48):**  And what makes, let's say, Regen Ventures different from I mean, I see many funds popping  
**[0:02:54-0:02:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:02:54):**  up now, but you're a very specific focus.  
**[0:02:56-0:03:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:02:56):**  Why the word Regen in the name and not just climate positive or positive days or net positive  
**[0:03:04-0:03:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:03:04):**  or climate tech or something like that?  
**[0:03:07-0:03:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:03:07):**  Because they also claim to want to restore the earth.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:03:10):**  But you have very specifically chosen to put regeneration or Regen in the name.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:03:15):**  That's right.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:03:16):**  And really, having learned the principles of regenerative agriculture, I set out to  
**[0:03:22-0:03:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:03:22):**  think about how they could be applied in other sectors.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:03:26):**  And the whole genesis of Regen was around a realization that sustainability is not enough  
**[0:03:32-0:03:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:03:32):**  and that we needed to back companies that were working with nature instead of against  
**[0:03:36-0:03:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:03:36):**  nature and not only tackling emissions and climate impacts, but also planetary health,  
**[0:03:42-0:03:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:03:42):**  which for us encompasses biodiversity, encourages the creation of life, water, nutrients, et  
**[0:03:49-0:03:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:03:49):**  cetera.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:03:50):**  And then thirdly, how human health interacts with those elements as well.  
**[0:03:54-0:03:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:03:54):**  And so that's, you know, core to our thesis is backing these companies that are going  
**[0:03:59-0:04:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:03:59):**  way beyond sustainability and directly improving the health of people and the planet.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:04:04):**  And when you say the principles of Regen ag, do you remember, say, when or how you stumbled  
**[0:04:10-0:04:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:04:10):**  upon that?  
**[0:04:11-0:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:04:11):**  Or maybe you grew up with that?  
**[0:04:12-0:04:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:04:12):**  What was the start there when you looked?  
**[0:04:15-0:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:04:15):**  I mean, I remember when I stumbled upon the soil farmers movement.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:04:18):**  But what was that in your case?  
**[0:04:20-0:04:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:04:20):**  I think I had like a general understanding.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:04:22):**  But Eric Tonsmeier's book, The Carbon Farming Revolution, and then his profile in Drawdown  
**[0:04:29-0:04:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:04:29):**  were really kind of pivotal moments of not only seeing soil health and soil in general  
**[0:04:36-0:04:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:04:36):**  being this massive carbon sink, but all of the additional co-benefits from that around  
**[0:04:41-0:04:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:04:41):**  nutrient density, water retention, building communities together.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:04:46):**  And that, you know, it all started in the soil and the microbial activity and fungal  
**[0:04:50-0:04:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:04:50):**  networks within there as well.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:04:52):**  And so for me, that was kind of this going beyond sustainability and really thinking  
**[0:04:58-0:05:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:04:58):**  about whole system health and starting the ground beneath our feet was one of those pivotal  
**[0:05:03-0:05:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:05:03):**  moments for me and set off on a course of deep dives into all sorts of different things  
**[0:05:07-0:05:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:05:07):**  from there.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:05:08):**  So I would say those moments for me were pretty pivotal.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:05:11):**  And yet you decided to set up a venture fund that is not only focused on region ag and  
**[0:05:16-0:05:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:05:16):**  food.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:05:17):**  You didn't set up a farmland fund or you didn't set up an ag tech fund.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:05:20):**  You very specifically and I will unpack that later, very curious, said, let's apply these  
**[0:05:25-0:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:05:25):**  principles beyond agriculture and food as well.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:05:28):**  That's right.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:05:29):**  Why?  
**[0:05:30-0:05:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:05:30):**  Well, I had the benefit of setting up a couple of farmland funds and thoroughly enjoyed that  
**[0:05:35-0:05:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:05:35):**  and learned a huge amount.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:05:38):**  And I guess for me, it was we need to go way beyond that and that these principles of life  
**[0:05:43-0:05:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:05:43):**  creating investing were applicable across all systems, particularly where consumer demand  
**[0:05:51-0:05:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:05:51):**  can be part of the solution.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:05:53):**  And for us, you know, climate meeting that consumer appetite for greener, healthier,  
**[0:05:58-0:06:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:05:58):**  superior products is what can really scale solutions at a massive level.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:06:02):**  And that's where we're focused.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:06:03):**  And that means you're focusing on consumer facing brands or are you focusing specifically  
**[0:06:08-0:06:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:06:08):**  on those type of companies as investors?  
**[0:06:11-0:06:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:06:11):**  Or could it be one level away from the end consumer?  
**[0:06:14-0:06:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:06:14):**  Yeah, not necessarily consumers in CPG, more so the things that touch our daily lives,  
**[0:06:21-0:06:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:06:21):**  what we eat, what we wear, the homes we live in, how we move around the planet, and that  
**[0:06:26-0:06:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:06:26):**  these choices that we're making every day and these necessary products that are in our  
**[0:06:30-0:06:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:06:30):**  lives that can be produced in ways that are upstream, healing the planet and downstream,  
**[0:06:36-0:06:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:06:36):**  improving our health at the same time.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:06:37):**  So do you have any examples where you apply that whole system view biomimicry approach  
**[0:06:43-0:06:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:06:43):**  to both the food space and a non-food space?  
**[0:06:46-0:06:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:06:46):**  And then we can unpack a bit what you mean by regenerative technologies, which I'm very,  
**[0:06:50-0:06:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:06:50):**  very curious about, obviously.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:06:51):**  Sure.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:06:52):**  So what do we start with a non-food space example, given I'm sure many of your listeners  
**[0:06:57-0:07:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:06:57):**  are very familiar with regenerative agriculture and the principles behind it.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:07:02):**  And so one of the companies that we're supporting are taking food waste and extracting collagen  
**[0:07:08-0:07:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:07:08):**  from that food waste to create leather alternatives.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:07:11):**  And so in doing so, really taking out of that supply chain, the negative emissions impact  
**[0:07:17-0:07:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:07:17):**  of raising cattle for leather production, as well as the toxic chemicals and heavy metals  
**[0:07:23-0:07:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:07:23):**  utilized in the tanning process.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:07:25):**  And that for us was a shocking industry when we dug into it and we read reports that showed  
**[0:07:32-0:07:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:07:32):**  us 90% of people that worked in that industry died before the age of 50 years old in Bangladesh.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:07:37):**  And so this company is taking the collagen source and then turning that into a beautiful  
**[0:07:42-0:07:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:07:42):**  material that is leather-like, finishing it with dyes and patterns in the production process,  
**[0:07:47-0:07:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:07:47):**  and then is then able to ship that to their end customers, which are beginning with the  
**[0:07:51-0:07:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:07:51):**  high-end fashion houses and then coming down the value chain and at scale can be cheaper  
**[0:07:55-0:07:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:07:55):**  than traditional leather alternatives.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:07:57):**  So for us, that's not only a circular, but also a regenerative materials company.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:08:03):**  And then I think related to the food space, we're really passionate about.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:08:07):**  What would happen, like you say, they extract this collagen from the waste.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:08:12):**  I mean, what would have happened otherwise with that food waste and, or is it still usable  
**[0:08:17-0:08:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:08:17):**  after?  
**[0:08:18-0:08:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:08:18):**  Do you only take one ingredient out?  
**[0:08:19-0:08:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:08:19):**  Like what is the alternative to making this alternative letter currently with this waste?  
**[0:08:24-0:08:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:08:24):**  Yeah, it's generally ground down into animal feed or fertilizers and can still be done  
**[0:08:29-0:08:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:08:29):**  so.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:08:30):**  So they're taking this rich collagen source out of that waste stream and then I guess  
**[0:08:35-0:08:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:08:35):**  upcycling that collagen into alternative leather materials.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:08:40):**  And the founder was doing his PhD at Cambridge and was studying cellular collagen cultivation.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:08:47):**  And in his mind, you know, it worked out that that was going to take a lot of capital and  
**[0:08:50-0:08:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:08:50):**  be a long way from time to scale.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:08:53):**  So when Scow at the natural world for rich collagen sources and then came across this  
**[0:08:58-0:09:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:08:58):**  extraction process to take it out of food waste.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:09:01):**  And is that process of looking for a chemical way and then finding out it potentially takes  
**[0:09:07-0:09:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:09:07):**  way longer and way more money and then going into nature between brackets, is that a normal  
**[0:09:13-0:09:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:09:13):**  process for like the founders you're backing?  
**[0:09:15-0:09:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:09:15):**  Does it seem to be something that happens often because you're really focusing on the  
**[0:09:19-0:09:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:09:19):**  bio-mimicry part?  
**[0:09:20-0:09:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:09:20):**  Or is it a one off that somebody looked into cellular and then actually came across a more  
**[0:09:24-0:09:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:09:24):**  natural and still food waste, but a more natural way to find this specific ingredient?  
**[0:09:28-0:09:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:09:28):**  Yeah, it's definitely a common thematic, but for us, you know, as individuals and what  
**[0:09:33-0:09:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:09:33):**  we're looking for on the investment side and then the founders that we're meeting.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:09:38):**  And for us, we are nature obsessed.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:09:40):**  We say, you know, we're looking for companies that are nature derived, inspired by nature.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:09:46):**  And that sometimes is being part of nature.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:09:49):**  And other times that is mimicking it, mimicry it.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:09:52):**  I don't even know if that's the word right through other means.  
**[0:09:55-0:10:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:09:55):**  So that's our passion is taking 4.6 billion years of evolution and taking all of that  
**[0:10:02-0:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:10:02):**  learning and applying our own human ingenuity on top of that to create products that are  
**[0:10:07-0:10:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:10:07):**  regenerative by nature.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:10:09):**  So how does cellular ag come into play when you are so nature focused?  
**[0:10:12-0:10:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:10:12):**  I think some people go like, how does that work?  
**[0:10:14-0:10:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:10:14):**  Or how do you see the role for that?  
**[0:10:16-0:10:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:10:16):**  So in the future of food and ag?  
**[0:10:17-0:10:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:10:17):**  Yeah, so we may be unique in that we're really looking for regenerative whole systems change.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:10:24):**  And so thinking about food production, we are super passionate about regenerative agriculture  
**[0:10:32-0:10:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:10:32):**  and all of the positive co-benefits that can come from that, as well as there are in our  
**[0:10:38-0:10:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:10:38):**  minds places for plant based alternatives, particularly when they're done with good core  
**[0:10:43-0:10:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:10:43):**  ingredients that are farmed in regenerative ways, and where they're healthier for humans,  
**[0:10:49-0:10:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:10:49):**  and they don't have a 300 list, or 300 name list of ingredients on the label, and also  
**[0:10:55-0:11:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:10:55):**  cellular alternatives as well, where that is the most efficient, healthiest, sustainable  
**[0:11:01-0:11:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:11:01):**  approach.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:11:02):**  And then for us, it's thinking about what production methods can those alternative methods  
**[0:11:06-0:11:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:11:06):**  replace that then allow us to regenerate degraded grasslands, desertified grazing lands that  
**[0:11:13-0:11:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:11:13):**  haven't been farmed sustainably today.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:11:16):**  So for us, we're taking like a whole system approach, we think all these things are necessary.  
**[0:11:20-0:11:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:11:20):**  And we are engaged in all of them.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:11:22):**  And we will, over the life of our fund be investing across that continuum.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:11:26):**  And do you have examples of like the plant based side, but also the cellular side, because  
**[0:11:31-0:11:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:11:31):**  I'm very curious about it, you hear, there's a lot of resources are going into that space.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:11:36):**  Obviously it sounds not very biomimicry, to say the least, but I'm not an expert.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:11:40):**  But also the plant based stuff, obviously, like the 300 ingredients on a package is something  
**[0:11:44-0:11:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:11:44):**  we see very often or the 20 or 30, whatever the number is, what do you see?  
**[0:11:48-0:11:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:11:48):**  What have you seen there that you can say, okay, this really fits in our thesis of putting  
**[0:11:53-0:11:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:11:53):**  nature aware part of nature and putting nature first, but still use cellular agriculture  
**[0:11:58-0:11:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:11:58):**  or still use plant based alternatives?  
**[0:11:59-0:12:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:11:59):**  Yeah, so for us, I think that the genetically modified monoculture, whether it's soy or  
**[0:12:08-0:12:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:12:08):**  pea protein based approaches are not regenerative.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:12:12):**  The life cycle analysis might show that they're better than previous alternatives, and that's  
**[0:12:18-0:12:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:12:18):**  okay.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:12:19):**  But for us, they're not truly regenerative.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:12:20):**  But there are other alternatives, whether they're mycelium based.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:12:25):**  So Meaty is an amazing company based in Colorado that are using the structure of fungal networks  
**[0:12:31-0:12:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:12:31):**  through mycelium to create steak and chicken.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:12:35):**  And I tried it nearly two years ago now, and it was the most phenomenal not steak steak  
**[0:12:40-0:12:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:12:40):**  that I've ever eaten.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:12:41):**  So those types of approaches are fundamentally, that's a healthier product, as well as being  
**[0:12:46-0:12:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:12:46):**  in our minds a regenerative practice or production method and using existing infrastructure.  
**[0:12:52-0:12:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:12:52):**  Because what does the mycelium grow on?  
**[0:12:55-0:12:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:12:55):**  What's like the feed source there because they also have to eat?  
**[0:12:58-0:13:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:12:58):**  So they're using yeast and microbes in, you know, essentially breweries, fermentation  
**[0:13:02-0:13:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:13:02):**  tanks, which again, like a natural process that is being accelerated within these factories,  
**[0:13:09-0:13:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:13:09):**  essentially to grow raw proteins.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:13:12):**  And that would be in the plant based meat alternative space, basically.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:13:15):**  But it's not fair because it's not really a plant like mycelium is somewhere, somewhere  
**[0:13:18-0:13:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:13:18):**  in another kingdom.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:13:19):**  But let's put them under the plant based one.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:13:22):**  But then the cellular ones, have you seen things there that are, and cellular is just,  
**[0:13:26-0:13:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:13:26):**  can you explain the cellular agriculture concept and movement as well for people that are not  
**[0:13:31-0:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:13:31):**  comfortable with that?  
**[0:13:32-0:13:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:13:32):**  Sure.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:13:33):**  So cellular agriculture is taking a biopsy from a living animal and growing those cells  
**[0:13:41-0:13:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:13:41):**  in a lab in generally what's called a growth media to duplicate and proliferate those cells.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:13:48):**  So they generally start with muscle tissue.  
**[0:13:51-0:13:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:13:51):**  They proliferate the muscle cells, then they add in things like fats to give structure  
**[0:13:56-0:13:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:13:56):**  and flavor.  
**[0:13:57-0:14:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:13:57):**  And then lastly, generally, there's a scaffold.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:14:00):**  So you can't just grow a bunch of cells in a flat petri dish and expect it to come out  
**[0:14:04-0:14:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:14:04):**  looking like a steak.  
**[0:14:05-0:14:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:14:05):**  You've got to bind it together in certain ways.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:14:07):**  So that's generally the process.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:14:09):**  No animals are harmed in that process.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:14:12):**  Where does the fat etc. come from?  
**[0:14:14-0:14:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:14:14):**  Is that vegetable fat at the end or animal fat?  
**[0:14:16-0:14:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:14:16):**  There's a set of different providers.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:14:19):**  So there are vegetable fats, there are companies using cellular animal fats, a company called  
**[0:14:24-0:14:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:14:24):**  Hoxton Farms in the UK, that's a great company, and also fermentation.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:14:29):**  So we've gone deep down the fermentation path, looking at a company that is building a fats  
**[0:14:34-0:14:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:14:34):**  platform using carbon dioxide as a feedstock.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:14:38):**  And then through that process, through fermentation, creating fats for initially cacao butter,  
**[0:14:44-0:14:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:14:44):**  so triglycerides, and then secondarily to that, two of the same three triglycerides  
**[0:14:50-0:14:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:14:50):**  that are in chocolate are also in bacon fat.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:14:52):**  So that company building out the fats platform, which gives the flavor and the mouthfeel to  
**[0:14:57-0:15:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:14:57):**  these products that previously wasn't there and impossible when it did heme, which has  
**[0:15:03-0:15:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:15:03):**  been a controversial ingredient.  
**[0:15:05-0:15:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:15:05):**  Some people love it, some people don't love it.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:15:07):**  But for us, this is a far more regenerative approach to doing so.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:15:10):**  Then you were asking about the cellular meat producers, and for us, one of the most audacious,  
**[0:15:18-0:15:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:15:18):**  ambitious projects is an Australian company called Vow, which are the premise of that  
**[0:15:23-0:15:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:15:23):**  company is that we've only ever domesticated five species on earth for protein production,  
**[0:15:30-0:15:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:15:30):**  but there's 2 million species on earth.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:15:32):**  And if we don't need to harm those species, there's most likely a far healthier, delicious  
**[0:15:38-0:15:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:15:38):**  protein alternative out there for us to produce.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:15:42):**  And so they're building a cell library where they're taking cells from a wide range of  
**[0:15:47-0:15:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:15:47):**  exotic animals, and they're proliferating those cells, growing those proteins.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:15:52):**  And essentially at the end of that, you'll be able to have 100% nutritional quality on  
**[0:15:57-0:16:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:15:57):**  one end and 100% taste and decadence potentially on the other, and be able to combine those  
**[0:16:02-0:16:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:16:02):**  things to create different forms of food.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:16:05):**  So fundamentally redefining what meat is.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:16:08):**  So that's quite interesting.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:16:09):**  We haven't invested in that company, but it's an incredibly ambitious project that we're  
**[0:16:14-0:16:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:16:14):**  really excited about.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:16:15):**  And what do you say to people that go immediately like, what about nutrients and health?  
**[0:16:20-0:16:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:16:20):**  Like how would you define that in this case?  
**[0:16:23-0:16:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:16:23):**  And how do we know?  
**[0:16:25-0:16:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:16:25):**  How do we know it's safe?  
**[0:16:26-0:16:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:16:26):**  Or how do we know it's probably it easily wins against CAFO steak or anything coming  
**[0:16:31-0:16:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:16:31):**  out of a factory farm, but compared to, let's say, grass finished and finished beef?  
**[0:16:35-0:16:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:16:35):**  I mean, there's a lot of discussion on animal protein and the health benefits depending  
**[0:16:39-0:16:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:16:39):**  on how you grow it.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:16:40):**  In this case, where would this fall?  
**[0:16:42-0:16:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:16:42):**  Or is this also the case of how you grow it makes the fundamental difference?  
**[0:16:46-0:16:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:16:46):**  What is your response to people that go a bit like, should we do that?  
**[0:16:50-0:16:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:16:50):**  And what would be the reaction of my body basically to eating this, which nobody has  
**[0:16:53-0:16:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:16:53):**  done yet at scale, obviously?  
**[0:16:55-0:16:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:16:55):**  Yeah.  
**[0:16:56-0:16:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:16:56):**  And to be perfectly honest, I had the same reaction.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:16:59):**  Like why do we need to do this?  
**[0:17:01-0:17:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:17:01):**  What are all the unintended consequences?  
**[0:17:04-0:17:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:17:04):**  And I think the honest answer is we don't yet know, but the bar is being set really  
**[0:17:09-0:17:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:17:09):**  high and the founders in generally in this space think the same as you and I, and they're  
**[0:17:15-0:17:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:17:15):**  wanting to optimize for both planetary health and human health and wanting to get to the  
**[0:17:19-0:17:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:17:19):**  best outcomes because they know that over time that's what the consumer will demand.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:17:24):**  So those founders in particular are hyper-focused on that.  
**[0:17:27-0:17:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:17:27):**  They don't want this to be a sort of slightly less bad for the planet, but terrible for  
**[0:17:33-0:17:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:17:33):**  your health product.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:17:35):**  Those two things need to be inextricably linked and positive.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:17:39):**  And I think fully acknowledge the amazing interaction of soil microbiome with the gut  
**[0:17:45-0:17:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:17:45):**  microbiome and all of those things.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:17:48):**  For example, like how do you, I wouldn't say copy that, but how do you capture that in  
**[0:17:52-0:17:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:17:52):**  things like that?  
**[0:17:53-0:17:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:17:53):**  Like, okay, we're growing this lettuce in aquaponics or hydroponics system and it gets  
**[0:17:59-0:18:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:17:59):**  pretty good in terms of nutrients.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:18:01):**  But as John Kemp says, it never gets to the highest level because for that it would need  
**[0:18:05-0:18:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:18:05):**  soil.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:18:06):**  So we get pretty okay and probably better than many other things, but we get to level  
**[0:18:09-0:18:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:18:09):**  three and never, never to level five or something like that because for that it needs the soil.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:18:13):**  And that even assumes that we can measure that at the moment, which we can't really.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:18:18):**  So that's, there's a huge discussion, obviously what is nutrient density?  
**[0:18:21-0:18:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:18:21):**  So what's the bar here?  
**[0:18:23-0:18:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:18:23):**  We want to go to all the way to level five or level three is good enough.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:18:27):**  For us, level five, a hundred percent.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:18:29):**  Like we want no compromise and that's a very high threshold.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:18:33):**  And that means that, you know, the universe of companies that meet that threshold for  
**[0:18:37-0:18:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:18:37):**  us is going to be pretty small.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:18:39):**  That's not to say that the level threes are not necessary, but for us, we want these truly  
**[0:18:45-0:18:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:18:45):**  transformative catalytic system change companies that can redefine their categories and be  
**[0:18:52-0:18:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:18:52):**  regenerative for people and the planet.  
**[0:18:56-0:18:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:18:56):**  And so that's how we think about it.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:18:58):**  And I think you're right.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:19:00):**  How long do you have?  
**[0:19:01-0:19:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:19:01):**  Like, what's the fun lifetime?  
**[0:19:02-0:19:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:19:02):**  Because it, Celera egg always sounds five to 10 years away, a bit like mini nuclear  
**[0:19:06-0:19:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:19:06):**  reactors, which will come at some point, but potentially, but this might be a long journey.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:19:12):**  What do you say to these founders?  
**[0:19:13-0:19:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:19:13):**  Like you're going to be there with them for a long time because they might take a while  
**[0:19:17-0:19:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:19:17):**  or you see that actually maybe happening faster than we expect.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:19:20):**  In five years, this could be actually a thing.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:19:23):**  Yeah, I think cellular ag is still quite a ways out and maybe that's beyond the lifetime  
**[0:19:29-0:19:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:19:29):**  of a venture fund.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:19:30):**  You know, we don't know the answer to that.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:19:32):**  And to be transparent, we haven't made any investments directly in that space because  
**[0:19:37-0:19:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:19:37):**  of that or because you didn't find it yet.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:19:40):**  The level five, probably both.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:19:42):**  So you didn't find a level five yet that within the lifetime of a venture fund, there's a  
**[0:19:46-0:19:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:19:46):**  reasonable estimate that it might do, it might reach certain levels that make it relevant  
**[0:19:53-0:19:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:19:53):**  for the fund, which is tricky.  
**[0:19:55-0:19:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:19:55):**  Yeah.  
**[0:19:56-0:19:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:19:56):**  Yeah.  
**[0:19:57-0:20:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:19:57):**  And so this company, Val, probably is on its way to level five and there are others trying  
**[0:20:02-0:20:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:20:02):**  and we hope there are more, but again, we are not attached to cellular agriculture.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:20:08):**  We fundamentally want to back companies that are regenerative across the whole system and  
**[0:20:14-0:20:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:20:14):**  we think there's a role to play for all of them as long as they are meeting the climate  
**[0:20:19-0:20:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:20:19):**  health, planetary health and human health aspects of the impact that we're looking for.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:20:25):**  And so how do you screen founders on that, I don't know, the biomimicry mindset?  
**[0:20:31-0:20:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:20:31):**  Sort of like, okay, because I see as quite a big separation in people in general that  
**[0:20:36-0:20:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:20:36):**  fundamentally see us as part of nature or fundamentally see us as, I don't know, the  
**[0:20:41-0:20:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:20:41):**  guardians or the stewards and we can manipulate all the way through because we're not part  
**[0:20:46-0:20:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:20:46):**  of it anyway.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:20:47):**  How do you, is that like your first question you ask or how do you filter through that  
**[0:20:52-0:20:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:20:52):**  on Zoom?  
**[0:20:53-0:20:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:20:53):**  Because you were obviously far away.  
**[0:20:56-0:21:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:20:56):**  I mean, you're able to travel now, but for the last year and a half you were not.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:21:00):**  Like how do you get comfortable with a team if they are in the deep tech, we'll edit our  
**[0:21:06-0:21:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:21:06):**  way out of it or we're part of nature and maybe we should be a bit more humble.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:21:10):**  Yeah, so validating teams and human capital due diligence is a huge part of our process  
**[0:21:17-0:21:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:21:17):**  and we're investing early and oftentimes a company is an idea that has been validated  
**[0:21:23-0:21:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:21:23):**  at some tiny scale and has not yet proven itself to be viable at huge scale.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:21:29):**  But what we can test for to your point is the intent of the founders.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:21:33):**  And for us, that's everything.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:21:34):**  And you know, is this their last work?  
**[0:21:37-0:21:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:21:37):**  And are they building a company that aspires to these regenerative principles or are they  
**[0:21:43-0:21:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:21:43):**  aspiring to a cease to do harm sustainability mindset?  
**[0:21:48-0:21:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:21:48):**  And again, like it's not a judgment of like what's better or worse, but for us, we're  
**[0:21:53-0:21:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:21:53):**  just shooting for that goal.  
**[0:21:54-0:21:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:21:54):**  And we think that venture capital exists to drive these fundamental breakthroughs.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:21:59):**  And for us, that's what we're looking for.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:22:01):**  So it's core, it's not a science, it's more of an art, I have to admit, but generally  
**[0:22:06-0:22:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:22:06):**  we can feel it.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:22:08):**  And we want to go on that journey with people and we want them to be looking for us to support  
**[0:22:13-0:22:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:22:13):**  them and hold them accountable to that aspiration.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:22:17):**  And oftentimes we're having founders self-select us.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:22:20):**  They see Regen and the team that we've assembled and what our thesis and aspiration is and  
**[0:22:27-0:22:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:22:27):**  they're aligned to that and they want us to be supporting them for the whole journey.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:22:33):**  And so just to put a stake in the ground, we're now talking end of October 2021, how  
**[0:22:39-0:22:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:22:39):**  many investments have you made?  
**[0:22:40-0:22:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:22:40):**  How much have you raised?  
**[0:22:41-0:22:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:22:41):**  What are the goals for the next months?  
**[0:22:44-0:22:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:22:44):**  Just to have to give people an idea of what Regen Ventures is at the moment, which obviously  
**[0:22:49-0:22:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:22:49):**  changes almost every week.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:22:51):**  But what are you, have you made two investments or 10 and what kind of assets under management  
**[0:22:55-0:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:22:55):**  currently?  
**[0:22:56-0:23:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:22:56):**  Yeah, so we've closed on three investments with another two currently closing.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:23:01):**  We'll have a portfolio of five very soon and they range from the food and agriculture space  
**[0:23:08-0:23:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:23:08):**  to materials through to more data and measurement tools for soil organic carbon.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:23:15):**  We're a team of seven.  
**[0:23:17-0:23:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:23:17):**  We've got five on the investment team, two on the operational team, spread across Australia  
**[0:23:21-0:23:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:23:21):**  and North America.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:23:23):**  And then we've got an amazing advisory board supporting them.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:23:26):**  We've done a first close and we're heading towards our second close prior to Thanksgiving  
**[0:23:31-0:23:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:23:31):**  in the US.  
**[0:23:33-0:23:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:23:33):**  And yeah, we're on track.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:23:34):**  We're feeling great about things at the moment.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:23:37):**  And every one of our investors feels like an extension of the team and the partnership.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:23:42):**  And they're coming along for the journey with us.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:23:45):**  And final close, what are you targeting in terms of size?  
**[0:23:48-0:23:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:23:48):**  Just to give an idea of what we're talking about.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:23:50):**  Yeah, so 50 million US dollars and we're investing at seed stage.  
**[0:23:55-0:23:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:23:55):**  Generally, occasionally we'll do pre-seed and series eight.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:23:59):**  And do you find it, is it difficult to find deal flow with very specific, but still a  
**[0:24:04-0:24:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:24:04):**  wide range of sectors, obviously with a very specific thesis, how has been the deal flow  
**[0:24:09-0:24:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:24:09):**  journey?  
**[0:24:10-0:24:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:24:10):**  How has been the pipeline development?  
**[0:24:12-0:24:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:24:12):**  It's been prolific.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:24:13):**  It's super exciting.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:24:15):**  I think even in the last 12 to 18 months, things have changed dramatically.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:24:20):**  What we're really seeing now is the three pillars that our investment thesis was built  
**[0:24:24-0:24:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:24:24):**  upon, which was initially this convergence of science, technology and engineering, making  
**[0:24:29-0:24:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:24:29):**  things possible that previously were not and at price points that are cheaper than their  
**[0:24:34-0:24:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:24:34):**  extractive incumbents.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:24:35):**  Secondly, the sheer consumer demand for these products.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:24:40):**  So NYU, a woman named Tensie Whelan has a sustainable product index and sustainably  
**[0:24:47-0:24:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:24:47):**  branded products are growing seven times the growth rate of conventional and have a 40%  
**[0:24:51-0:24:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:24:51):**  price premium.  
**[0:24:52-0:24:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:24:52):**  So that kind of market pool is accelerating exponentially.  
**[0:24:57-0:25:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:24:57):**  And then the third piece, which is really around the talent and the people that want  
**[0:25:02-0:25:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:25:02):**  to go and build these companies and are leaving big tech, big corporate or universities where  
**[0:25:07-0:25:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:25:07):**  they might have an academic career to go and dedicate their lives to building companies  
**[0:25:12-0:25:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:25:12):**  that are healing the earth is exceptional.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:25:15):**  And so all of that combined is just sowing the seeds for a really rich environment for  
**[0:25:20-0:25:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:25:20):**  people to start companies, and then it's also a very collaborative ecosystem.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:25:25):**  And I think that that's super important, whether it's accelerators, universities and other  
**[0:25:30-0:25:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:25:30):**  funds like we need hundreds of trillions of dollars to flow into the space if we're going  
**[0:25:35-0:25:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:25:35):**  to solve these existential challenges.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:25:38):**  And nearly everyone in the market today who are backing these companies is looking to  
**[0:25:43-0:25:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:25:43):**  build great syndicates of investors to surround these founders with incredible support networks  
**[0:25:49-0:25:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:25:49):**  that can help them scale and scale quickly.  
**[0:25:51-0:25:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:25:51):**  And so for us, that's sort of the three areas that we're receiving inbound deal flow from.  
**[0:25:57-0:26:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:25:57):**  And we're reciprocating and it's a virtuous collective wisdom cycle.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:26:01):**  And is it getting like, is the space heating up in a sense of valuations going up?  
**[0:26:06-0:26:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:26:06):**  Is there more competition?  
**[0:26:08-0:26:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:26:08):**  I mean, it's obviously the collaboration, but if you're, if a deal is limited in size,  
**[0:26:11-0:26:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:26:11):**  there might be some sharper elbows going around.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:26:14):**  Do you see any of that?  
**[0:26:15-0:26:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:26:15):**  Which it might be a good sign because it means we're getting more interest.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:26:18):**  But what do you see on that side?  
**[0:26:19-0:26:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:26:19):**  Or is it still, let's say quote unquote, a bit lonely on the investor and the investor  
**[0:26:24-0:26:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:26:24):**  side?  
**[0:26:25-0:26:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:26:25):**  It's certainly heating up, not only dedicated funds like ourselves.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:26:29):**  There's quite a few now that have launched in Europe, Pale Blue Dot, Friends in Sweden,  
**[0:26:34-0:26:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:26:34):**  we love and 2150, which just launched more of a city infrastructure fund.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:26:40):**  That's quite interesting.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:26:41):**  And then, you know, all around the world, there are very specific funds in certain categories.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:26:47):**  And then there are the generalists and the traditional tech funds that are allocating  
**[0:26:51-0:26:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:26:51):**  more and more capital to the space because underlying a lot of these companies is the  
**[0:26:56-0:27:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:26:56):**  core enabling technologies that have been developed over the last 10, 20, 30 years.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:27:02):**  It's enabling a whole lot of these solutions and business models to be built on top of  
**[0:27:06-0:27:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:27:06):**  them.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:27:07):**  So, you know, we think the more capital, the better, better for founders.  
**[0:27:11-0:27:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:27:11):**  We're very comfortable with our role and our thesis and our ability to meet founders and  
**[0:27:18-0:27:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:27:18):**  demonstrate our support and value add over the journey.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:27:22):**  So what do you miss?  
**[0:27:23-0:27:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:27:23):**  What is missing in this space at the moment?  
**[0:27:25-0:27:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:27:25):**  It sounds like there's a lot of deal flow and investors.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:27:28):**  What would you like to see more of?  
**[0:27:30-0:27:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:27:30):**  I would like to see more of these truly whole system regenerative companies, you know, where  
**[0:27:37-0:27:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:27:37):**  we're removing carbon, we're improving biodiversity and through those things, the health of people  
**[0:27:45-0:27:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:27:45):**  is improving and that we can do that in business models that are scalable and do it fast.  
**[0:27:51-0:27:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:27:51):**  I think there are a lot of parts of that equation that can be met, but bringing all of those  
**[0:27:56-0:27:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:27:56):**  things together is no easy feat.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:27:59):**  So which subsectors are you?  
**[0:28:02-0:28:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:28:02):**  Would you love to see more deal flow?  
**[0:28:04-0:28:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:28:04):**  Is that the seaweed space?  
**[0:28:05-0:28:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:28:05):**  Is it the alternative, maybe the plant based ones or the, I mean, you're laughing.  
**[0:28:09-0:28:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:28:09):**  You cannot see them.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:28:10):**  I see them video.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:28:12):**  So definitely see what we're going to dig a bit deeper.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:28:14):**  But is it the plant based ones like apart from meaty, the mycelium space?  
**[0:28:19-0:28:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:28:19):**  Is it which other subsectors you say, okay, I would love, I would really love to see a  
**[0:28:24-0:28:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:28:24):**  thicker deal flow pipeline there.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:28:26):**  Yeah, we're doing a lot right now in biodiversity.  
**[0:28:30-0:28:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:28:30):**  So a whole piece of work on what is biodiversity?  
**[0:28:34-0:28:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:28:34):**  What are the problems with that market?  
**[0:28:36-0:28:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:28:36):**  Well, one, there isn't a market, you know, which is a problem.  
**[0:28:40-0:28:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:28:40):**  How do we value it?  
**[0:28:41-0:28:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:28:41):**  How do we measure it?  
**[0:28:42-0:28:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:28:42):**  Could be, maybe it's not a problem.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:28:43):**  I mean, how we value it and measure it, measure for sure.  
**[0:28:47-0:28:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:28:47):**  But I mean, there's obviously a camp that says if we put a price on it, it will be sold,  
**[0:28:51-0:28:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:28:51):**  but it will also be measured.  
**[0:28:53-0:28:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:28:53):**  So what's your take on biodiversity so far?  
**[0:28:55-0:29:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:28:55):**  It's early, but it seems sort of the underlying, the underlying value, not value, the underlying  
**[0:29:02-0:29:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:29:02):**  theme in many of these things without biodiversity, most of this wouldn't exist.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:29:07):**  Most of us wouldn't exist.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:29:09):**  That's right.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:29:10):**  And so I think for us getting away from this myopic focus just on carbon so that we don't  
**[0:29:16-0:29:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:29:16):**  go and plant millions and millions of eucalyptus trees in a monoculture environment that completely  
**[0:29:22-0:29:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:29:22):**  destroys any other life in that ecosystem, that we would be like, we're non carbon, but  
**[0:29:28-0:29:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:29:28):**  a total fail.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:29:29):**  It has such a positive carbon footprint.  
**[0:29:31-0:29:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:29:31):**  Why is it not good then?  
**[0:29:34-0:29:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:29:34):**  Exactly.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:29:35):**  And that's the problem, right?  
**[0:29:36-0:29:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:29:36):**  Because we're not valuing those other ecosystem services and all of the co-benefits that come  
**[0:29:41-0:29:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:29:41):**  from that.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:29:42):**  So, you know, I think that's an area that we have gone into with eyes wide open, with  
**[0:29:49-0:29:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:29:49):**  no kind of preconceived ideas of what the solution is and starting to piece together  
**[0:29:56-0:30:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:29:56):**  what is required to, as you pointed out, measure and unfortunately, or fortunately, like we  
**[0:30:03-0:30:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:30:03):**  have a capitalistic model.  
**[0:30:06-0:30:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:30:06):**  If it is valued, it will be protected and improved upon, we hope.  
**[0:30:11-0:30:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:30:11):**  And so, you know, in the short term, that probably is the answer.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:30:14):**  Just like carbon, the economics of that now are starting to stack up so much that, you  
**[0:30:19-0:30:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:30:19):**  know, you mentioned seaweed, like where it's actually economical to grow gigatons of seaweed  
**[0:30:26-0:30:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:30:26):**  in the ocean and sink it to the bottom of the ocean for permanent storage.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:30:30):**  And that's a viable business model.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:30:32):**  There's a company doing that.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:30:33):**  I also saw a lot of discussion about if that actually made sense.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:30:36):**  But what is your take on that?  
**[0:30:37-0:30:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:30:37):**  Is that a holistic view sinking it into the ocean?  
**[0:30:40-0:30:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:30:40):**  So basically, for the listeners that don't know, there's a company backed by quite a  
**[0:30:43-0:30:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:30:43):**  few very famous investors that is growing seaweed and letting it float, basically sink  
**[0:30:49-0:30:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:30:49):**  down the bottom of the ocean where it should be stored for quite a while, basically sinking  
**[0:30:53-0:30:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:30:53):**  carbon into the depths of the ocean.  
**[0:30:56-0:31:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:30:56):**  And there's some discussion around the negative potential side effects of that.  
**[0:31:00-0:31:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:31:00):**  What would be your, I don't know if you invested in that, so maybe I'm on very thin ice.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:31:03):**  We did not.  
**[0:31:04-0:31:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:31:04):**  But what is your holistic view on an approach like that?  
**[0:31:07-0:31:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:31:07):**  Not that specific company, because I think it's fascinating what they do, because it  
**[0:31:10-0:31:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:31:10):**  could be applied to seaweed growing and eating as well, because they just scale this stack  
**[0:31:14-0:31:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:31:14):**  with carbon credits, basically.  
**[0:31:16-0:31:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:31:16):**  But what is your thinking when you see something?  
**[0:31:18-0:31:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:31:18):**  When you see an article like that or you see a deck like that?  
**[0:31:20-0:31:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:31:20):**  What's your thinking?  
**[0:31:21-0:31:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:31:21):**  Yeah.  
**[0:31:22-0:31:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:31:22):**  So for us, that particular solution is the highest quality carbon removal that you can  
**[0:31:30-0:31:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:31:30):**  get through nature based solutions.  
**[0:31:33-0:31:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:31:33):**  So people want to build big machines and they want to suck carbon out of the atmosphere  
**[0:31:37-0:31:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:31:37):**  and they want to bury it underground.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:31:39):**  They are and they're investing in it.  
**[0:31:40-0:31:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:31:40):**  And it's a solution to everything then.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:31:44):**  And that's thousands of dollars per ton and we don't know what happens when we squeeze  
**[0:31:48-0:31:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:31:48):**  it into these tiny cracks under the earth.  
**[0:31:51-0:31:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:31:51):**  What could go wrong?  
**[0:31:52-0:31:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:31:52):**  Yeah, but they have Moore's law.  
**[0:31:53-0:31:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:31:53):**  So like in a few years, it will be so much cheaper.  
**[0:31:56-0:31:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:31:56):**  I'm being sarcastic here, obviously.  
**[0:31:59-0:32:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:31:59):**  It might work, it might work, but there's a lot of brainpower and resources going into  
**[0:32:02-0:32:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:32:02):**  that specific one instead of.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:32:04):**  It might work and it's likely to be necessary.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:32:07):**  Like let's be realistic.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:32:09):**  But let's think about seaweed.  
**[0:32:10-0:32:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:32:10):**  So what excites you about that?  
**[0:32:12-0:32:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:32:12):**  Seaweed on the other hand has the same thousand year permanent storage that direct air capture  
**[0:32:19-0:32:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:32:19):**  and storage does at a fraction of the cost and likely has a bunch of additional co-benefits  
**[0:32:26-0:32:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:32:26):**  around ecosystem restoration.  
**[0:32:29-0:32:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:32:29):**  We've destroyed 95% of the kelp forests on the planet so we can actively restore those.  
**[0:32:35-0:32:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:32:35):**  It's fish habitat.  
**[0:32:37-0:32:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:32:37):**  It cools sea surface temperatures as well as sinking carbon to the bottom of the ocean.  
**[0:32:42-0:32:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:32:42):**  So I think like net on net, of course, like too much of anything is a bad thing and we  
**[0:32:47-0:32:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:32:47):**  need to be careful of putting the right species in the right places.  
**[0:32:50-0:32:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:32:50):**  And we were just talking about biodiversity, not having a monoculture of seaweed across  
**[0:32:54-0:32:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:32:54):**  the ocean that destroys everything that comes in its path.  
**[0:32:58-0:33:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:32:58):**  But I think like the right mindset and the right tools that are modular and scalable  
**[0:33:04-0:33:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:33:04):**  and not at risk of catastrophic failure, the first cyclone or hurricane that comes through.  
**[0:33:11-0:33:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:33:11):**  I think that those solutions have a place and we're excited.  
**[0:33:14-0:33:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:33:14):**  We're looking.  
**[0:33:15-0:33:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:33:15):**  And yet you didn't invest in this one.  
**[0:33:17-0:33:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:33:17):**  We didn't invest in that one.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:33:18):**  We looked at very hard at another one and continue to be really interested in the space.  
**[0:33:23-0:33:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:33:23):**  But what are you missing there?  
**[0:33:24-0:33:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:33:24):**  Is there like, yeah, you want to, do you want the seaweed to be useful in either for ingredients  
**[0:33:30-0:33:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:33:30):**  or cosmetics or feed or food?  
**[0:33:33-0:33:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:33:33):**  Does that fit better in your holistic thinking than sinking it even though it's towards carbon?  
**[0:33:37-0:33:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:33:37):**  Yeah, I think it's a mix.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:33:39):**  But as you pointed out, seaweed has great use cases in cosmetics, in protein extraction  
**[0:33:45-0:33:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:33:45):**  for human consumption, in animal feed and fertilizers, in plastics.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:33:50):**  So I think that the value of seaweed can be great.  
**[0:33:55-0:34:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:33:55):**  And also the carbon potential of it is quite extraordinary at a pretty low price point.  
**[0:34:00-0:34:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:34:00):**  So for us, that's what we're looking for and the teams that both have that ambition and  
**[0:34:06-0:34:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:34:06):**  the pragmatism to go build it.  
**[0:34:08-0:34:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:34:08):**  And I think there's not a whole lot of IP in putting some floating things in the ocean  
**[0:34:13-0:34:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:34:13):**  and growing stuff.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:34:15):**  So I think there's room for lots of people.  
**[0:34:17-0:34:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:34:17):**  It's very difficult.  
**[0:34:18-0:34:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:34:18):**  I have seen some.  
**[0:34:20-0:34:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:34:20):**  It's very tricky.  
**[0:34:21-0:34:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:34:21):**  But then as a VC, you probably don't want, I'm just answering the question for you, but  
**[0:34:26-0:34:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:34:26):**  probably don't want to invest in someone with not too much IP and a huge farming operation  
**[0:34:32-0:34:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:34:32):**  because at the end of the day, it's a massive farming operation if you do this at scale.  
**[0:34:35-0:34:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:34:35):**  So where would you come in with you're looking for that specific technology angle with unique  
**[0:34:40-0:34:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:34:40):**  IP, maybe on the extraction side or on the genetic side?  
**[0:34:43-0:34:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:34:43):**  What would be a role theoretically for a VC like yourself in the seaweed space?  
**[0:34:48-0:34:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:34:48):**  Probably not at farming 100,000 hectares or something like that?  
**[0:34:51-0:34:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:34:51):**  Yeah, it's really around the structures and the devices to grow these on, you know, that  
**[0:34:57-0:35:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:34:57):**  are autonomous, solar powered.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:35:00):**  The tractors and the stuff.  
**[0:35:01-0:35:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:35:01):**  Yeah.  
**[0:35:02-0:35:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:35:02):**  You know, have self harvesting mechanisms built within them.  
**[0:35:06-0:35:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:35:06):**  The tools of the space, basically the tool shop of the seaweed space is where you get  
**[0:35:11-0:35:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:35:11):**  excited.  
**[0:35:12-0:35:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:35:12):**  Yeah, that can enable massive industry.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:35:15):**  Super interesting.  
**[0:35:16-0:35:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:35:16):**  And then, so okay, seaweed, we touched upon any other sub sectors of the whole regeneration  
**[0:35:21-0:35:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:35:21):**  space, which is massive, but also in biodiversity, are you looking at marketplaces or sensors  
**[0:35:26-0:35:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:35:26):**  or what are you looking at or dreaming about that somebody knocks on your door tomorrow  
**[0:35:30-0:35:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:35:30):**  with the perfect team and a perfect nature focus and obviously the perfect values, but  
**[0:35:35-0:35:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:35:35):**  what would they need to be doing to get you excited in biodiversity?  
**[0:35:38-0:35:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:35:38):**  Yeah, I think measurement reporting and verification for biodiversity is a really, really tough  
**[0:35:45-0:35:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:35:45):**  problem to solve.  
**[0:35:46-0:35:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:35:46):**  It's much harder than carbon.  
**[0:35:48-0:35:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:35:48):**  And even carbon is not that easy.  
**[0:35:50-0:35:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:35:50):**  No, but we're talking like carbon is generally in a tree or below the ground.  
**[0:35:56-0:36:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:35:56):**  Whereas this, you've got things flying around everywhere, animals moving through the ecosystem.  
**[0:36:00-0:36:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:36:00):**  Like it's very dynamic.  
**[0:36:02-0:36:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:36:02):**  Do you think it would be possible to find like a proxy?  
**[0:36:04-0:36:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:36:04):**  Like I don't know, wild bees or something that if you count that it's a pretty good  
**[0:36:08-0:36:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:36:08):**  proxy for the rest of the ecosystem or do we need a full system approach to say, okay,  
**[0:36:14-0:36:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:36:14):**  this place is full of biodiversity, which is a bit of a weird thing to say anyway.  
**[0:36:18-0:36:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:36:18):**  Full of life basically.  
**[0:36:19-0:36:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:36:19):**  Yeah.  
**[0:36:20-0:36:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:36:20):**  I don't know.  
**[0:36:21-0:36:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:36:21):**  Do you know something?  
**[0:36:22-0:36:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:36:22):**  I don't know about what the bees can tell us around measuring biodiversity, but yeah.  
**[0:36:26-0:36:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:36:26):**  They're good sensors.  
**[0:36:27-0:36:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:36:27):**  There's good sensors.  
**[0:36:28-0:36:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:36:28):**  I think the wild ones, I mean, we had some interesting from a beekeeper, some interesting  
**[0:36:33-0:36:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:36:33):**  lessons and it seemed to be obviously he was biased because it's a beekeeper, but especially  
**[0:36:38-0:36:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:36:38):**  the wild ones have a very good, I mean, if they're there, it usually means the ecosystem  
**[0:36:44-0:36:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:36:44):**  is on its way up or at least in a good shape.  
**[0:36:47-0:36:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:36:47):**  If they're not there, you can probably forget about it.  
**[0:36:50-0:36:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:36:50):**  But maybe there are other insect species or specific things that are easier to measure  
**[0:36:53-0:36:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:36:53):**  but they give a good proxy for wild birds or certain predators.  
**[0:36:58-0:37:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:36:58):**  If you have those obviously in context that like they always say, if predators are around  
**[0:37:03-0:37:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:37:03):**  you, you are, I mean, if they are happy, the rest of the ecosystem must be happy as well  
**[0:37:07-0:37:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:37:07):**  because they can easily move normally or they die out.  
**[0:37:10-0:37:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:37:10):**  But then are there markets around biodiversity yet or is that still completely starting?  
**[0:37:16-0:37:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:37:16):**  I think there are attempts to build them, but again, it's how do you place a value?  
**[0:37:21-0:37:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:37:21):**  Is it value per hectare?  
**[0:37:23-0:37:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:37:23):**  Is it value per ton or unit of biodiversity?  
**[0:37:28-0:37:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:37:28):**  I think all of these things yet to be determined, but incredibly interesting problems to tackle.  
**[0:37:34-0:37:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:37:34):**  And I think to your point around like actually the, you know, measuring the species and the  
**[0:37:40-0:37:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:37:40):**  biodiversity within those, every system is so dynamic and different that a 10 star biodiversity  
**[0:37:47-0:37:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:37:47):**  near the equator may never be able to be replicated somewhere else.  
**[0:37:51-0:37:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:37:51):**  And so like the deserts, the grasslands, the scrub lands, all these different areas, I  
**[0:37:57-0:38:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:37:57):**  think we'll have like carbon eventually will a whole spectrum of biodiversity credits.  
**[0:38:03-0:38:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:38:03):**  You know, the Great Barrier Reef is a great one here.  
**[0:38:05-0:38:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:38:05):**  Like we finally have reef credits in Australia around protecting harmful agricultural runoff  
**[0:38:11-0:38:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:38:11):**  from hitting the waterways that flow onto the reef.  
**[0:38:14-0:38:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:38:14):**  And so that's another example of this.  
**[0:38:16-0:38:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:38:16):**  Took 20 years, but finally, yeah.  
**[0:38:19-0:38:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:38:19):**  Go us.  
**[0:38:20-0:38:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:38:20):**  No, but I mean, it's fundamental.  
**[0:38:22-0:38:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:38:22):**  At least something happened.  
**[0:38:24-0:38:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:38:24):**  I mean, we can mourn on the losses, but at least something moved.  
**[0:38:28-0:38:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:38:28):**  And hopefully it's an example for many other reefs that are in similar or even worse shape.  
**[0:38:33-0:38:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:38:33):**  Yeah.  
**[0:38:34-0:38:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:38:34):**  And so I think fundamentally to shifting carbon and biodiversity from costs and expenses or  
**[0:38:42-0:38:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:38:42):**  quote unquote offsets to investments is a fundamental paradigm shift that we think will  
**[0:38:48-0:38:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:38:48):**  encourage the right behaviors and for the next generation to be investing in that future.  
**[0:38:55-0:39:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:38:55):**  Meaning let's invest in these farms upstream to change practices.  
**[0:39:00-0:39:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:39:00):**  So we actually protect and potentially regenerate plus seaweed investments, part of the Great  
**[0:39:05-0:39:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:39:05):**  Barrier Reef, which will save half of our tourism industry because that is an investment  
**[0:39:10-0:39:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:39:10):**  to make sure that people can still go diving and not everything is bleached off basically.  
**[0:39:13-0:39:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:39:13):**  Then it becomes not a cost, but it comes a fundamental investment to save in this case,  
**[0:39:17-0:39:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:39:17):**  the tourism industry and of course, biodiversity and those making those connections with water.  
**[0:39:23-0:39:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:39:23):**  Sometimes the biodiversity might be easier than with carbon.  
**[0:39:25-0:39:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:39:25):**  Yeah.  
**[0:39:26-0:39:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:39:26):**  And as an individual, if I choose to fly somewhere and I choose to offset those flights, maybe  
**[0:39:32-0:39:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:39:32):**  I'm going to tick the box twice over and actually be investing and being an owner of carbon  
**[0:39:39-0:39:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:39:39):**  rather than just offsetting my life.  
**[0:39:41-0:39:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:39:41):**  And so I'm actively being part of something that's building the solution as opposed to  
**[0:39:46-0:39:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:39:46):**  like just going to neutral.  
**[0:39:48-0:39:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:39:48):**  And so, yeah, I think there's a whole group of assets that are yet to be built, but are  
**[0:39:54-0:39:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:39:54):**  starting to be put together and that's really exciting.  
**[0:39:57-0:40:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:39:57):**  And so if you had to give obviously not investment advice, but like to, let's say there's a whole  
**[0:40:02-0:40:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:40:02):**  audience, a theater full of impact investors or people looking for net positive impact,  
**[0:40:06-0:40:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:40:06):**  listening to this, what would you tell them to focus on or to look for?  
**[0:40:11-0:40:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:40:11):**  Would it be, I don't know, a holistic view?  
**[0:40:13-0:40:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:40:13):**  Would it be look at seaweed?  
**[0:40:15-0:40:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:40:15):**  Would it be look at some other sector or maybe somewhere else?  
**[0:40:18-0:40:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:40:18):**  Where should they start if they want to go down the rabbit hole?  
**[0:40:21-0:40:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:40:21):**  If they're interested in regeneration in general?  
**[0:40:23-0:40:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:40:23):**  What would you give them as a, as a pointer, as a map?  
**[0:40:26-0:40:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:40:26):**  Okay, start here and you can, you can go down the rabbit hole.  
**[0:40:29-0:40:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:40:29):**  Look, I think everyone's different and we all have the things that we like to geek out  
**[0:40:33-0:40:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:40:33):**  on and are drawn to more specifically.  
**[0:40:37-0:40:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:40:37):**  But I think the beauty of this movement towards a regenerative economy is that the products  
**[0:40:44-0:40:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:40:44):**  and services that we depend on every single day can be part of the solution.  
**[0:40:49-0:40:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:40:49):**  So I think it starts with daily purchasing and then from there it's like, how do I then  
**[0:40:54-0:41:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:40:54):**  allocate capital towards things that I'm passionate about and people that I'm passionate about  
**[0:41:00-0:41:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:41:00):**  supporting and are going to fundamentally change the things that I want to be changed.  
**[0:41:06-0:41:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:41:06):**  And from there, I think like, as you know, for yourself with this podcast, like when  
**[0:41:10-0:41:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:41:10):**  you're excited and just intellectually curious about something, you do the work to go deeper  
**[0:41:16-0:41:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:41:16):**  and deeper and deeper to learn that system.  
**[0:41:18-0:41:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:41:18):**  So it's not for me to say what's important to other people, but I think what we eat and  
**[0:41:24-0:41:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:41:24):**  what we wear and how we move are like fundamentally core things that we should be investing in  
**[0:41:31-0:41:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:41:31):**  and that it's fun.  
**[0:41:33-0:41:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:41:33):**  And the people doing that are the smartest, brightest, most ambitious people on the planet  
**[0:41:38-0:41:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:41:38):**  today.  
**[0:41:39-0:41:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:41:39):**  And these are going to be the companies that will be the iconic companies of the next 20,  
**[0:41:44-0:41:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:41:44):**  30 years.  
**[0:41:45-0:41:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:41:45):**  And what did you say to, let's say it's a, we're on stage in this theater, obviously  
**[0:41:50-0:41:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:41:50):**  a beautifully old one with a wooden floor.  
**[0:41:53-0:41:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:41:53):**  I'm just painting a picture for the audio.  
**[0:41:55-0:41:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:41:55):**  And somebody asks you, but what about this technology is coming, the techno optimist?  
**[0:41:59-0:42:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:41:59):**  Let's just use CRISPR, let's use gene editing, let's use vertical farming because it's all  
**[0:42:05-0:42:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:42:05):**  possible.  
**[0:42:06-0:42:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:42:06):**  I've had those discussions very often.  
**[0:42:07-0:42:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:42:07):**  Like what about that?  
**[0:42:08-0:42:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:42:08):**  What is your response to, how do you get people, I'm looking for an answer personally, actually  
**[0:42:12-0:42:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:42:12):**  is a personal problem.  
**[0:42:13-0:42:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:42:13):**  I'm not asking for a friend, I'm asking for me.  
**[0:42:16-0:42:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:42:16):**  What is your way of making them, I don't know, curious about nature or a bit more humble  
**[0:42:20-0:42:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:42:20):**  maybe in these, because they've seen the decks of these techno optimist companies that promise  
**[0:42:25-0:42:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:42:25):**  the moon and the stars with 98% reductions in XYZ and usually turns out a bit different.  
**[0:42:31-0:42:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:42:31):**  But how do you get people slightly more curious about, I don't know, compost or a tree or  
**[0:42:36-0:42:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:42:36):**  another monoculture?  
**[0:42:37-0:42:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:42:37):**  Like how do we get people to see nature and to see us as part of nature?  
**[0:42:41-0:42:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:42:41):**  Is there a story you tell?  
**[0:42:42-0:42:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:42:42):**  Is there a book you recommend?  
**[0:42:44-0:42:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:42:44):**  Is there a trip you recommend?  
**[0:42:45-0:42:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:42:45):**  How do we, when we meet these extreme techno optimists, how do we make them curious again  
**[0:42:51-0:42:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:42:51):**  or think beyond?  
**[0:42:52-0:42:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:42:52):**  Is there something you do?  
**[0:42:53-0:42:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:42:53):**  It's a great question.  
**[0:42:54-0:42:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:42:54):**  Because you must meet them all the time.  
**[0:42:57-0:42:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:42:57):**  Yeah.  
**[0:42:58-0:43:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:42:58):**  I think just the acknowledgement that the earth has been around for 4.6 billion years  
**[0:43:05-0:43:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:43:05):**  and what it has learned and evolved to, I just can't comprehend that we think our 1  
**[0:43:13-0:43:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:43:13):**  million years on earth is superior to that.  
**[0:43:16-0:43:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:43:16):**  So I think that's at a high level.  
**[0:43:17-0:43:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:43:17):**  But you asked about books, like I think Arna Nass, The Ecology of Wisdom is one of the  
**[0:43:22-0:43:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:43:22):**  most beautiful books that I've ever read.  
**[0:43:26-0:43:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:43:26):**  And I think paints that picture beautifully and the humility that you pointed out that  
**[0:43:32-0:43:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:43:32):**  we are part of nature and that earth will be fine.  
**[0:43:37-0:43:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:43:37):**  We might just get wiped out or we might wipe ourselves out, but earth will be fine a million  
**[0:43:41-0:43:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:43:41):**  years from now.  
**[0:43:43-0:43:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:43:43):**  But why would we want that when we know that the solutions are right in front of us and  
**[0:43:48-0:43:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:43:48):**  that we have the power to actually fundamentally change things and that we probably don't need  
**[0:43:56-0:44:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:43:56):**  to sacrifice anything to do that, that we can actually create a richer, more livable  
**[0:44:03-0:44:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:44:03):**  lifestyle for all of us by doing these things?  
**[0:44:07-0:44:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:44:07):**  To me, it's so simple and clear and it's what I want to spend my life working on.  
**[0:44:14-0:44:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:44:14):**  My family is part of the journey and everyone we interact with, I think they're aligned.  
**[0:44:21-0:44:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:44:21):**  It's pretty simple to me.  
**[0:44:23-0:44:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:44:23):**  And if you had a magic wand and you could change one thing, like you say, we have the  
**[0:44:27-0:44:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:44:27):**  power to change.  
**[0:44:28-0:44:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:44:28):**  And let's say you have the magic power to change one thing overnight in food and egg,  
**[0:44:32-0:44:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:44:32):**  but could be apparel, could be global consciousness, could be abolishing chemical pesticides.  
**[0:44:38-0:44:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:44:38):**  I mean, it could be anything or making us all taste better food overnight and healing  
**[0:44:42-0:44:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:44:42):**  our taste buds.  
**[0:44:43-0:44:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:44:43):**  I mean, what would you do?  
**[0:44:45-0:44:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:44:45):**  That's a good question.  
**[0:44:48-0:44:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:44:48):**  I would just encourage people to go outside, go for a hike and come back and just acknowledge  
**[0:44:57-0:45:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:44:57):**  the feelings that you had being in the wild and all of the life that was around you and  
**[0:45:02-0:45:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:45:02):**  come back into human world and figure out like, is that worth sacrificing for that extra  
**[0:45:10-0:45:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:45:10):**  bedroom or faster petrol powered car?  
**[0:45:14-0:45:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:45:14):**  Like really?  
**[0:45:16-0:45:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:45:16):**  I think that's as simple as it is for me, like love nature and all of the creatures  
**[0:45:21-0:45:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:45:21):**  and do our best to support that and have fun doing it.  
**[0:45:26-0:45:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:45:26):**  So there is a bit of, I wouldn't say a sacrifice, but if I really want my faster petrol car,  
**[0:45:31-0:45:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:45:31):**  there's behavioral change necessary.  
**[0:45:32-0:45:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:45:32):**  It's not that we can just keep going because I might want an extra bedroom or think I want  
**[0:45:36-0:45:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:45:36):**  it or I need it.  
**[0:45:38-0:45:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:45:38):**  What do you see as the role of behavior change in this whole space?  
**[0:45:41-0:45:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:45:41):**  Because we might end up buying a different steak because it's mycelium based or different  
**[0:45:46-0:45:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:45:46):**  apparel because it's no longer leather, but equally or better.  
**[0:45:51-0:45:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:45:51):**  But there are choices we have to make or we should make and it seems like people are making  
**[0:45:56-0:45:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:45:56):**  that.  
**[0:45:57-0:45:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:45:57):**  That's what you refer to as consumer demand.  
**[0:45:58-0:46:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:45:58):**  Is it going to be tricky to get everybody on board with those choices or do we need  
**[0:46:04-0:46:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:46:04):**  a stubborn 20 or 15% to kick this off?  
**[0:46:07-0:46:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:46:07):**  How do you see that?  
**[0:46:08-0:46:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:46:08):**  And then it just becomes obvious.  
**[0:46:09-0:46:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:46:09):**  Like it seems to be a bit with electric cars at the moment, even though there's still a  
**[0:46:13-0:46:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:46:13):**  lot of denial and reports coming out that actually it's not as clean, obviously usually  
**[0:46:19-0:46:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:46:19):**  sponsored by the fossil fuel companies.  
**[0:46:20-0:46:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:46:20):**  Like there's still a lot of noise on the radar it seems, but do you see that happening as  
**[0:46:25-0:46:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:46:25):**  well in our space or are we still too early for that?  
**[0:46:28-0:46:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:46:28):**  Yeah, I just think products that are, we call it the Daft Punk thesis, better, faster, stronger,  
**[0:46:36-0:46:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:46:36):**  cheaper, cooler, whatever it might be.  
**[0:46:39-0:46:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:46:39):**  That's amazing.  
**[0:46:41-0:46:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:46:41):**  Like there's going to be demand for them and out of the gate they may be more expensive,  
**[0:46:47-0:46:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:46:47):**  but the cost curves are coming down so quickly that I don't think people are going to need  
**[0:46:52-0:46:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:46:52):**  to pay more for some of these things in the future if we incentivize things right.  
**[0:46:56-0:47:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:46:56):**  And your question will point around nutrient density before.  
**[0:47:00-0:47:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:47:00):**  If we know the true cost of things, I think we know the right choices to make and that  
**[0:47:05-0:47:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:47:05):**  they're just going to be better and make our lives better.  
**[0:47:08-0:47:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:47:08):**  And I don't think we're going to get there with the urgency we need to by sort of depending  
**[0:47:15-0:47:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:47:15):**  on altruistic motivations or human consciousness.  
**[0:47:19-0:47:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:47:19):**  Like as much as we do need to change that, it's probably not in our lifetime to do that.  
**[0:47:26-0:47:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:47:26):**  So I think for us it's...  
**[0:47:27-0:47:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:47:27):**  You can invest in a lot of meditation apps that might help actually.  
**[0:47:31-0:47:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:47:31):**  It might be unconsciousness level that might be the best investment you can make I sometimes  
**[0:47:35-0:47:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:47:35):**  think.  
**[0:47:36-0:47:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:47:36):**  Totally.  
**[0:47:37-0:47:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:47:37):**  Or in spaces and calm.  
**[0:47:38-0:47:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:47:38):**  Or raising children, you know, being a good parent.  
**[0:47:42-0:47:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:47:42):**  And so what if like overnight we took your magic wand away, unfortunately, but your fund  
**[0:47:48-0:47:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:47:48):**  did grow to $1 billion.  
**[0:47:50-0:47:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:47:50):**  And what would you focus on?  
**[0:47:52-0:47:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:47:52):**  I'm not asking specific dollar amounts, etc.  
**[0:47:55-0:47:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:47:55):**  But what would be instead of 50 million, you actually had a billion dollars to invest?  
**[0:47:59-0:48:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:47:59):**  Would you be exactly focusing on the same thing and just scale the team, basically 20x?  
**[0:48:05-0:48:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:48:05):**  Or would you do certain things differently?  
**[0:48:07-0:48:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:48:07):**  Would you do a farmland fund on the side to do a lot of things or a real wilding fund  
**[0:48:10-0:48:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:48:10):**  or a biodiversity fund?  
**[0:48:12-0:48:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:48:12):**  How would you approach it if you had significantly more resources on the financial side than  
**[0:48:17-0:48:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:48:17):**  you have now?  
**[0:48:18-0:48:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:48:18):**  Yeah, so our vision from the get go is to build a global platform, not only a single  
**[0:48:23-0:48:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:48:23):**  fund.  
**[0:48:24-0:48:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:48:24):**  And so that is our roadmap.  
**[0:48:26-0:48:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:48:26):**  Exactly what you said.  
**[0:48:27-0:48:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:48:27):**  And creating a regenerative capital stack across the entire lifecycle of a company from  
**[0:48:33-0:48:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:48:33):**  the first check in to IPO, and then on top of that infrastructure, you know, farmland,  
**[0:48:40-0:48:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:48:40):**  real assets, credit in time, and that those assets have the right capital base in order  
**[0:48:48-0:48:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:48:48):**  to achieve the outcomes and impacts that we need them to.  
**[0:48:52-0:48:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:48:52):**  That's our vision.  
**[0:48:53-0:48:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:48:53):**  And that's what I'd be doing with that.  
**[0:48:54-0:48:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:48:54):**  And I'm probably going to open a rabbit hole here.  
**[0:48:58-0:48:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:48:58):**  What about you mentioned IPO?  
**[0:48:59-0:49:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:48:59):**  What about ownership?  
**[0:49:00-0:49:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:49:00):**  What about long term ownership?  
**[0:49:02-0:49:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:49:02):**  Everybody knows the challenges and opportunities of the stock market.  
**[0:49:05-0:49:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:49:05):**  What do you feel there for these regenerative companies?  
**[0:49:08-0:49:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:49:08):**  Does there need to be a different regenerative ownership structure?  
**[0:49:12-0:49:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:49:12):**  But what are your thoughts?  
**[0:49:13-0:49:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:49:13):**  I mean, many of the companies you talk with are still a few years away, let's say from  
**[0:49:17-0:49:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:49:17):**  IPO.  
**[0:49:18-0:49:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:49:18):**  So you have the chance to figure that out.  
**[0:49:19-0:49:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:49:19):**  What does a regenerative ownership structure look like?  
**[0:49:22-0:49:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:49:22):**  Or should they all go to the general stock exchange?  
**[0:49:24-0:49:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:49:24):**  Yeah, I think there's more long term holding structures than there ever has been.  
**[0:49:31-0:49:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:49:31):**  Whether that's private markets model or a public markets model, I'm not tired either  
**[0:49:36-0:49:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:49:36):**  way.  
**[0:49:37-0:49:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:49:37):**  That's probably changed over the last 12 to 18 months.  
**[0:49:39-0:49:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:49:39):**  But fundamentally, you see companies like Rivian going public now.  
**[0:49:44-0:49:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:49:44):**  And Rose, who's one of our partners is a board member there.  
**[0:49:47-0:49:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:49:47):**  And they just made nature a shareholder.  
**[0:49:49-0:49:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:49:49):**  They gave 1% of the equity of the company to nature to conserve.  
**[0:49:53-0:49:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:49:53):**  Just for a background, Rose is the ex CEO of Patagonia, just to the people that don't  
**[0:49:57-0:49:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:49:57):**  know.  
**[0:49:58-0:50:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:49:58):**  And Rivian is an electric car company that makes very interesting, very big pickup trucks,  
**[0:50:03-0:50:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:50:03):**  basically, predominantly for the US market at the moment.  
**[0:50:06-0:50:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:50:06):**  But they look quite cool.  
**[0:50:07-0:50:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:50:07):**  I'll put a link in the description if that's your kind of thing.  
**[0:50:10-0:50:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:50:10):**  But they make nature, I didn't know that they made nature their shareholder.  
**[0:50:12-0:50:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:50:12):**  That's interesting.  
**[0:50:13-0:50:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:50:13):**  And how does she vote?  
**[0:50:15-0:50:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:50:15):**  Probably quite radical.  
**[0:50:16-0:50:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:50:16):**  Yeah, I'd say so.  
**[0:50:17-0:50:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:50:17):**  I guess, but that's an example, I think, of embedding these values, not only in private  
**[0:50:23-0:50:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:50:23):**  markets, but in public markets.  
**[0:50:25-0:50:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:50:25):**  And then you have things like the long term stock exchange, you know, now cropping up,  
**[0:50:29-0:50:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:50:29):**  where Asana and there's another company that have now listed their stock there.  
**[0:50:34-0:50:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:50:34):**  And then you have Carter, which is an amazing fund administrator and share registry platform,  
**[0:50:41-0:50:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:50:41):**  creating liquidity within companies on a thing called Carter X, you know, an internal exchange,  
**[0:50:47-0:50:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:50:47):**  where I'm a private company like Stripe, and I'm actually able to trade shares amongst  
**[0:50:51-0:50:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:50:51):**  my employees, my shareholders through this exchange.  
**[0:50:54-0:50:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:50:54):**  So like, I think there are...  
**[0:50:56-0:50:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:50:56):**  So it's private, but sort of public for a limited public.  
**[0:50:59-0:51:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:50:59):**  There's a lot of... and in a few years, when you have to deal with these things, probably  
**[0:51:03-0:51:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:51:03):**  the amount of options, the number of options will have exploded again, basically, because  
**[0:51:07-0:51:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:51:07):**  these two options weren't there two years ago.  
**[0:51:09-0:51:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:51:09):**  Yeah.  
**[0:51:10-0:51:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:51:10):**  And I think it's important that the day we're talking today, Sequoia just announced an Evergreen  
**[0:51:16-0:51:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:51:16):**  fund.  
**[0:51:17-0:51:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:51:17):**  Wow.  
**[0:51:18-0:51:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:51:18):**  Yeah.  
**[0:51:19-0:51:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:51:19):**  That's interesting.  
**[0:51:20-0:51:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:51:20):**  You know, they're innovating on the venture capital model.  
**[0:51:22-0:51:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:51:22):**  And was that your dream to do an Evergreen fund?  
**[0:51:25-0:51:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:51:25):**  It was.  
**[0:51:26-0:51:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:51:26):**  Another rabbit hole.  
**[0:51:27-0:51:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:51:27):**  Yeah.  
**[0:51:28-0:51:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:51:28):**  We need other episodes for this.  
**[0:51:31-0:51:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:51:31):**  That's interesting, because I've talked to many, and they say, okay, we could have done  
**[0:51:35-0:51:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:51:35):**  an Evergreen, probably raised less, probably spent a lot more time trying to convince people.  
**[0:51:41-0:51:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:51:41):**  And yeah, we're running out of time on the climate side and the diversity side.  
**[0:51:44-0:51:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:51:44):**  So it's a trade off to invest now and then figure out along the way what the next phase  
**[0:51:48-0:51:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:51:48):**  for these companies look like.  
**[0:51:50-0:51:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:51:50):**  And yeah, it's a shame that not more investors are ready.  
**[0:51:53-0:51:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:51:53):**  But the fact that Sequoia is doing an Evergreen probably makes the next one a bit easier if  
**[0:51:57-0:52:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:51:57):**  you also do an Evergreen in the future.  
**[0:52:00-0:52:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:52:00):**  Yeah.  
**[0:52:01-0:52:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:52:01):**  Look, they did it.  
**[0:52:02-0:52:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:52:02):**  You're not the only weirdo in the corner anymore.  
**[0:52:05-0:52:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:52:05):**  Yeah.  
**[0:52:06-0:52:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:52:06):**  Exactly.  
**[0:52:07-0:52:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:52:07):**  That's fascinating.  
**[0:52:08-0:52:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:52:08):**  And it doesn't work for everyone.  
**[0:52:09-0:52:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:52:09):**  But I think, you know...  
**[0:52:10-0:52:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:52:10):**  No, but there's more options on the table.  
**[0:52:13-0:52:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:52:13):**  Exactly.  
**[0:52:14-0:52:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:52:14):**  You know, the right option for the right company, the right form of capital, the right time.  
**[0:52:18-0:52:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:52:18):**  I think they're all there.  
**[0:52:20-0:52:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:52:20):**  Which is, I mean, sort of the core thesis.  
**[0:52:22-0:52:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:52:22):**  I mean, you need diversity in regeneration, which is a core theme within.  
**[0:52:26-0:52:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:52:26):**  You need diversity in terms of capital options.  
**[0:52:29-0:52:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:52:29):**  And so far, it has been either debt or equity and not so many flavors in between.  
**[0:52:34-0:52:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:52:34):**  And that's changing fast, it seems, which is good.  
**[0:52:39-0:52:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:52:39):**  I want to thank you so much.  
**[0:52:40-0:52:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:52:40):**  We have a lot more to discuss, but it's probably not the last time we chat.  
**[0:52:44-0:52:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:52:44):**  Thank you for sharing.  
**[0:52:45-0:52:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:52:45):**  I'm very curious to follow Regia Ventures over time to see what investments you make,  
**[0:52:50-0:52:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:52:50):**  to see what you learn about biodiversity and what you end up investing in, because it's  
**[0:52:53-0:52:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:52:53):**  always interesting.  
**[0:52:55-0:52:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:52:55):**  It's interesting to do the research and then how does it actually get practical?  
**[0:52:58-0:53:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:52:58):**  How and if and when you invest in cellular ag, obviously, and also seaweed and many other  
**[0:53:04-0:53:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:53:04):**  things.  
**[0:53:05-0:53:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:53:05):**  So thank you so much this evening for you, Dan, for sharing a bit with us on the podcast.  
**[0:53:10-0:53:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:53:10):**  Thank you so much for having me, Koen.  
**[0:53:11-0:53:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:53:11):**  And for all you've done over, I believe, five years now with the podcast, I think it's  
**[0:53:16-0:53:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:53:16):**  been a core part of the regenerative agriculture movement.  
**[0:53:20-0:53:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:53:20):**  And I've learned a lot from all your amazing guests.  
**[0:53:23-0:53:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:53:23):**  It's been awesome to be on.

**[0:55:45-0:55:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:55:45):**  different means.  
**[0:55:46-0:55:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:55:46):**  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you, and if you have the means to

**[0:56:02-0:56:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:56:02):**  so you don't have to write along.  
**[0:56:04-0:56:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:56:04):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:56:09-0:56:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:56:09):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:56:15-0:56:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:56:15):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find, or what kind of investors you could  
**[0:56:19-0:56:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:56:19):**  find if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:56:21-0:56:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:56:21):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:56:26-0:56:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:56:26):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:56:30-0:56:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:56:30):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design, and a lot more.  
**[0:56:34-0:56:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:56:34):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:56:35-0:56:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:56:35):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:56:37-0:56:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:56:37):**  Unfortunately, that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:56:40-0:56:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:56:40):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:56:43-0:56:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:56:43):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:56:45-0:56:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/dan-fitzgerald#t=0:56:45):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.

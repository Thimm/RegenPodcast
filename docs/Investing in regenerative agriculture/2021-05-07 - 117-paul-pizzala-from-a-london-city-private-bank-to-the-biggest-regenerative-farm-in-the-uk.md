**[0:00:12-0:00:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:00:13):**  How a London City private banker took a permaculture course and now applies his finance knowledge  
**[0:00:19-0:00:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:00:19):**  to build the biggest regenerative farm of the UK.  
**[0:00:23-0:00:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:00:23):**  Definitely stay until the end to hear from Mark Drouill, the Executive Chair, how investors  
**[0:00:27-0:00:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:00:27):**  are responding to the new equity offer compared to debt of new foundation farms.  
**[0:00:34-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:00:34):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture.  
**[0:00:38-0:00:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:00:38):**  Investing as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:40-0:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:00:40):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:44-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:00:44):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:00:49-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:00:49):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:00:54):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:56-0:01:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:00:56):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:00-0:01:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:01:00):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:02-0:01:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:01:02):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:07-0:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:01:07):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:01:11):**  In March last year, we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support

**[0:01:38-0:01:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:01:38):**  Welcome to another episode.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:01:39):**  This time where we peel new foundation farms even further.  
**[0:01:42-0:01:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:01:42):**  This time we have Paul Pizzala, the chief investment officer on why a good business  
**[0:01:46-0:01:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:01:46):**  model is key and carbon credits are a distraction.  
**[0:01:50-0:01:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:01:50):**  Welcome Paul.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:01:51):**  Hello Jun.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:01:52):**  So, to start with your personal story, how did you end up at new foundation farms and  
**[0:01:56-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:01:56):**  going so deep literally in soil business models and all of that?  
**[0:02:00-0:02:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:02:00):**  The short answer is the global financial crisis in 2008-2009 prompted a lot of questions about  
**[0:02:10-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:02:10):**  what is the purpose of finance.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:02:12):**  So I can give you the sort of the plain vanilla story about...  
**[0:02:16-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:02:16):**  Now we want a long one.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:02:17):**  Okay, how that took me to, you know, doing a lot of research into the whole area of climate  
**[0:02:23-0:02:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:02:23):**  change.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:02:24):**  But if I wind the clock back, you know, it was watching David Attenborough documentaries  
**[0:02:30-0:02:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:02:30):**  about the natural world.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:02:32):**  And then there's always that kind of bit at the end where the forests were getting, you  
**[0:02:39-0:02:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:02:39):**  know, sown down by the loggers and there was always a bit of a sting in the tail.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:02:43):**  And that was kind of, you know, we'd sit there in the TV room with mum and my grandfather  
**[0:02:50-0:02:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:02:50):**  at the time and my brother.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:02:52):**  And you know, my mother would always say, well, you know, she'd sort of gloss over that  
**[0:02:56-0:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:02:56):**  bit at the end and pretend it wasn't happening.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:02:58):**  So you just focus on all the nice bits, but somehow or the other, that was the bit that  
**[0:03:03-0:03:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:03:03):**  kind of stuck with me.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:03:06):**  And yeah, so, you know, I've always been into things like climbing, getting into the outdoors  
**[0:03:12-0:03:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:03:12):**  and it's been a real kind of, you know, being in nature has been a real source of joy and  
**[0:03:18-0:03:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:03:18):**  solace and connection in a very crazy, complicated, fast paced world.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:03:23):**  So I've always been very, had that sort of deep joy and wonder of nature.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:03:29):**  And what sort of happened during the global financial crisis, I asked myself, you know,  
**[0:03:33-0:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:03:33):**  what is finance doing to solve these issues that we're facing?  
**[0:03:39-0:03:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:03:39):**  And you know, on the back of that, I started doing some courses.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:03:42):**  I did a permaculture course back in, I think it was 2008, 2009.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:03:49):**  And it just completely opened up my, changed my perspective in terms of the direction of  
**[0:03:56-0:04:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:03:56):**  travel of an industrial society, particularly from this perspective of agricultural permaculture  
**[0:04:04-0:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:04:04):**  and systems change and sort of understanding how industrial agriculture got to the state  
**[0:04:10-0:04:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:04:10):**  of where it is today.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:04:11):**  In some ways it's a quirk of fate, you know, post the second world war and there was a  
**[0:04:16-0:04:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:04:16):**  lot of carbon nitrates and potassiums for munitions to be used.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:04:21):**  And you know, somebody had a great idea of using it as fertilizer and hey presto, nobody  
**[0:04:25-0:04:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:04:25):**  really knew that fertilizer was sort of destroying soil biology.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:04:28):**  That was one side of it.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:04:31):**  The other side of it was learning about soil.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:04:34):**  And we had this really cool guy called Rod Edward who was leading the course.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:04:39):**  And I would sort of describe him as the Doctor Who of permaculture, a real kind of cool,  
**[0:04:46-0:04:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:04:46):**  interesting character with his farm up in, I think it was Lancashire, up in the Dales.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:04:52):**  And he basically kind of demonstrated every aspect of permaculture on his farm, you know,  
**[0:04:58-0:05:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:04:58):**  from companion planting, how to use sort of passive heating through solar masses, you  
**[0:05:05-0:05:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:05:05):**  know, rainwater collection, kind of all these different sorts of technologies on his farm.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:05:10):**  So it's like a sense of alternative technology, but in real time.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:05:13):**  But the big thing that really sort of blew my mind with these concepts that if you do  
**[0:05:18-0:05:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:05:18):**  permaculture or horticulture the right way, that the yield is infinite.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:05:22):**  And it was just a real kind of concept that stuck in my mind, which seems to completely  
**[0:05:26-0:05:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:05:26):**  blow conventional logic out of the water.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:05:29):**  I know many people that did a permaculture course and then actually didn't, maybe they  
**[0:05:34-0:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:05:34):**  changed their garden or they, but let's say professionally, they haven't put that to work  
**[0:05:40-0:05:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:05:40):**  as much as you're doing now.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:05:41):**  So what happened after that?  
**[0:05:43-0:05:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:05:43):**  Like how did you, you could have come back to banking like after the week or two weeks  
**[0:05:46-0:05:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:05:46):**  or whatever the number was and you could have been back in the normal financial world, but  
**[0:05:53-0:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:05:53):**  you didn't.  
**[0:05:54-0:05:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:05:54):**  And you find yourself at a new foundation farms, which is really ambitious in terms  
**[0:05:58-0:06:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:05:58):**  of bringing permaculture and the whole principle of regenerative principles of regenerative  
**[0:06:02-0:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:06:02):**  agriculture to scale.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:06:03):**  So what happened in between that?  
**[0:06:05-0:06:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:06:05):**  Like what made that shift from this is great.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:06:07):**  I now see that infinite yields are potentially possible and everything I thought about ag  
**[0:06:11-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:06:11):**  is different, but then you actually start, okay, I need to work in this space.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:06:15):**  I mean, Monday to Friday or to Saturday, my block of time that I use, my financial brain  
**[0:06:21-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:06:21):**  and needs to be put to work in this space.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:06:23):**  So what was that journey like?  
**[0:06:25-0:06:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:06:25):**  Yeah, great question.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:06:26):**  And it wasn't a logical sequence of events at all.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:06:31):**  So I heard about a place called Schumacher college when I was on this permaculture course  
**[0:06:37-0:06:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:06:37):**  and it sounded like a very interesting place to learn about these alternative narratives  
**[0:06:44-0:06:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:06:44):**  and ecology.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:06:45):**  And I looked up, I was working in the city at the time and private banking and you know,  
**[0:06:51-0:06:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:06:51):**  I went back to private banking, but I, I did my research on Schumacher college and I had  
**[0:06:59-0:07:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:06:59):**  a chat with some folks about it and I said, Oh, Schumacher, he's the guy who wrote Small  
**[0:07:04-0:07:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:07:04):**  is Beautiful and looked at the curriculum, you know, complexity science, deep ecology,  
**[0:07:10-0:07:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:07:10):**  you know, all sorts of really interesting stuff, but also a completely different way  
**[0:07:13-0:07:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:07:13):**  of learning as well, much more embodied way of learning as well as an analytical way of  
**[0:07:18-0:07:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:07:18):**  learning.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:07:19):**  And that was when I jumped ship from the city in 2012 to take this deep dive into ecology.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:07:26):**  I mean, I've always been a bit of a risk taker, you know, coming from a financial background.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:07:30):**  So I was quite comfortable doing that and I'd always wanted to be an entrepreneur in  
**[0:07:35-0:07:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:07:35):**  some shape or form.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:07:36):**  So it felt like a, it felt like the right thing to do.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:07:40):**  And of course at Schumacher college, they have a horticulture program.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:07:44):**  They have the holistic science program, which is what I did.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:07:47):**  They have a, what they call regenerative economics program now, which is they're going to launch  
**[0:07:51-0:07:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:07:51):**  a regenerative agriculture program in September this year.  
**[0:07:56-0:07:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:07:56):**  So some really exciting and fantastic things happening there.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:07:59):**  And that's kind of really opened up a whole new level of understanding in terms of the  
**[0:08:05-0:08:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:08:05):**  challenges that we face.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:08:06):**  You know, what I found really interesting about Schumacher college is that the narrative  
**[0:08:10-0:08:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:08:10):**  was very much about a local economy transition based change to addressing climate change  
**[0:08:19-0:08:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:08:19):**  and the other, if you like planetary boundaries that are, whether it's deforestation, ocean  
**[0:08:25-0:08:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:08:25):**  acidification, so on and so forth, the solutions are very much presented through the lens of  
**[0:08:31-0:08:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:08:31):**  transition and local change.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:08:33):**  And I did follow that route for a while.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:08:35):**  Like I got involved in local renewable energy and raising finance for hydro and solar projects,  
**[0:08:42-0:08:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:08:42):**  but it sort of struck me that those projects was very useful and important at a local level  
**[0:08:49-0:08:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:08:49):**  weren't going to shift the needle at an industrial macro scale.  
**[0:08:54-0:08:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:08:54):**  So on the back of that, I went back to the city and I ended up getting a job with an  
**[0:08:59-0:09:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:08:59):**  impact fund manager in public equity markets who had their own theory of change and way  
**[0:09:06-0:09:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:09:06):**  of dividing up the market into positive impacts, let's say neutral and negative impact companies.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:09:14):**  And kind of what you end up with is quite a small bucket of investable companies that  
**[0:09:20-0:09:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:09:20):**  are doing something positive in the world.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:09:22):**  And it sort of struck me that that's brilliant, but there's this other 95% capital that needs  
**[0:09:29-0:09:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:09:29):**  to make the shift.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:09:31):**  And what really sparked my interest was to find the entrepreneurs that were the disruptive  
**[0:09:38-0:09:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:09:38):**  entrepreneurs that were putting these solutions into practice on the ground and on the back  
**[0:09:45-0:09:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:09:45):**  of that, that's really, I've known Mark for about four or five years and we talked about  
**[0:09:51-0:09:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:09:51):**  various different projects.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:09:52):**  We talked about launching a fund on the back of the office book, The Meaningful Economy.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:09:58):**  But that didn't really speak to me, but when he came to my office with Marcus and pitched  
**[0:10:03-0:10:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:10:03):**  the idea of new foundation farms, it was just so obvious to me that the soil is the core  
**[0:10:11-0:10:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:10:11):**  asset of humanity, not just agriculture.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:10:15):**  And so that's kind of when I literally sort of leapt out of my chair and said, yes, this  
**[0:10:18-0:10:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:10:18):**  is, this is for me.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:10:20):**  But they like pitched it to you to join or they pitched because they were looking for  
**[0:10:24-0:10:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:10:24):**  money?  
**[0:10:25-0:10:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:10:25):**  Yeah, they pitched to me cause they were looking for money.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:10:27):**  And I was super excited in the process of working with them and looking at strategy  
**[0:10:33-0:10:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:10:33):**  and going through pitch decks.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:10:35):**  We formed a very trusted, close relationship and eventually sort of six months ago joined  
**[0:10:41-0:10:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:10:41):**  as chief investment officer.  
**[0:10:43-0:10:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:10:43):**  And which is actually an excellent bridge to what we already discussed in the previous  
**[0:10:48-0:10:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:10:48):**  interviews, obviously the fundraising process and what has changed over the last weeks because  
**[0:10:54-0:10:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:10:54):**  you were, and obviously please walk me through the process.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:10:58):**  You are still really ambitious, but raising 20 million pounds sterling in depth and we  
**[0:11:03-0:11:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:11:03):**  uncovered that and we also discussed the differences or the unusual way of doing that or the fact  
**[0:11:08-0:11:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:11:08):**  that you raise such a large depth instead of equity or instead of a mix, et cetera.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:11:13):**  Obviously everything about new foundation farms is quite unusual, but you have made  
**[0:11:16-0:11:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:11:16):**  some changes in the last couple of weeks.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:11:18):**  Can you speak a bit about what you've learned and the why of these changes in the offering  
**[0:11:23-0:11:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:11:23):**  basically obviously very clearly this is not investment advice, but I'm very interested  
**[0:11:27-0:11:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:11:27):**  in how these mechanisms work and obviously learning or pitching to so many people and  
**[0:11:33-0:11:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:11:33):**  having so many conversations has changed something within the organization and you've now adjusted,  
**[0:11:40-0:11:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:11:40):**  let's say the offerings.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:11:41):**  I'm very curious about that process.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:11:42):**  Yeah, that's a great question.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:11:44):**  So the initial offer was to have a preference share, which is in effect a securitized investment  
**[0:11:55-0:12:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:11:55):**  that has the collateral of the company's assets as security.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:12:00):**  So it gives the investor a good feeling of comfort because there's a strong asset backing  
**[0:12:05-0:12:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:12:05):**  and that comes with a fixed return, say something like a 4% coupon, which in the world of government  
**[0:12:16-0:12:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:12:16):**  bonds and corporate bonds looks quite attractive.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:12:20):**  In the world of venture capital, impact investing and private equity, it's not going to really  
**[0:12:27-0:12:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:12:27):**  excite anybody.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:12:29):**  So there's the sort of the nature of ambition of financial capital seeking return.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:12:34):**  That's definitely one aspect that came back to us in terms of having a better balance  
**[0:12:40-0:12:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:12:40):**  of risk return and impact.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:12:43):**  The impact story has never been an issue.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:12:46):**  That's a real driver in terms of interest and that's the hook.  
**[0:12:52-0:13:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:12:52):**  What was causing some investors to fall off the hook was the financial return on offer.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:13:00):**  But it wasn't just that it's only 4%.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:13:03):**  It's well, hang on a second.  
**[0:13:05-0:13:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:13:05):**  We want to be in the journey with you, boots and all, and to be fully participating as  
**[0:13:11-0:13:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:13:11):**  a risk taker, that means we want the upside as well as the risk and as well as the impact.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:13:17):**  So that was really that side of the story.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:13:21):**  And then we took that feedback and we looked at it more closely ourselves in order for  
**[0:13:27-0:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:13:27):**  everybody to be aligned and motivated and sharing risk equally.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:13:32):**  When you sort of step back and take a look at it, it does make sense for investors and  
**[0:13:39-0:13:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:13:39):**  founders to be equally on the line in terms of risk and reward.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:13:45):**  So it's just a much better alignment of interests at the end of the day.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:13:50):**  And so can you walk us through what you're currently, so what has changed from that 20  
**[0:13:55-0:13:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:13:55):**  million of preferred shares with a 4% return?  
**[0:13:59-0:14:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:13:59):**  What are you currently looking for?  
**[0:14:00-0:14:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:14:00):**  What are you currently talking to, talking about to investors?  
**[0:14:04-0:14:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:14:04):**  Sure.  
**[0:14:05-0:14:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:14:05):**  Okay.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:14:06):**  So that's 20 million and broadly speaking, 16 million of that is in farmland acquisition,  
**[0:14:14-0:14:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:14:14):**  a thousand acre farm with some capital expenditure for retail and processing on the farm.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:14:22):**  And then roughly 4 million for what we would call enterprise development.  
**[0:14:27-0:14:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:14:27):**  So for the executive team, for the systems, consulting, so on and so forth, ready to develop  
**[0:14:35-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:14:35):**  the enterprise platform to be able to scale the business well above and beyond a thousand  
**[0:14:40-0:14:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:14:40):**  acres.  
**[0:14:41-0:14:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:14:41):**  So what's on offer for investors?  
**[0:14:44-0:14:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:14:44):**  Well, it's 25% of the profits of the company.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:14:49):**  So effectively what you would be getting is a 25% share of the profits of the company  
**[0:14:55-0:15:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:14:55):**  and you would be getting the security of the asset.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:15:00):**  So in a way what we've done is we've said, look, the mission, the impact, the business  
**[0:15:06-0:15:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:15:06):**  model, all of that stays exactly the same.  
**[0:15:08-0:15:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:15:08):**  There's no change there.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:15:10):**  What we're doing is recognizing that investors want, they want more upside that comes with  
**[0:15:16-0:15:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:15:16):**  the risk.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:15:17):**  And we're also saying, you know, to make this a really good deal for you, we're making sure  
**[0:15:26-0:15:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:15:26):**  that providers of capital are first in line in the capital structure.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:15:30):**  So the money is capitalized by the assets of the company, i.e. the farmlands, the capex,  
**[0:15:38-0:15:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:15:38):**  you know, cash on the balance sheet.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:15:39):**  So in those terms, I mean, if I was looking at it, I would be going, wow, that's a really  
**[0:15:44-0:15:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:15:44):**  good deal.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:15:45):**  Of course, with a different risk structure, because it could be less than 4%.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:15:49):**  What's the duration?  
**[0:15:50-0:15:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:15:50):**  Like, it's buying back equity with the profit, like a profit sharing.  
**[0:15:54-0:15:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:15:54):**  How long am I potentially as an investor, like how long am I part of the journey?  
**[0:15:58-0:16:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:15:58):**  In this case, where's the cap?  
**[0:16:00-0:16:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:16:00):**  So a good benchmark would be to think in terms of venture capital or private equity.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:16:06):**  In terms of risk, basically.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:16:07):**  Yeah, in terms of risk, but also in terms of how long do I need to think, what is my  
**[0:16:12-0:16:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:16:12):**  time horizon as an investor?  
**[0:16:14-0:16:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:16:14):**  So your time horizon has got to be really at least 10 years, you know.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:16:19):**  So it's going to take four years to get to a point where we're demonstrating profitability  
**[0:16:26-0:16:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:16:26):**  at that stage of the game.  
**[0:16:29-0:16:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:16:29):**  When we've proven out the business model, the ecology, the economics, the processing,  
**[0:16:33-0:16:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:16:33):**  the brand, the customer satisfaction, the ability to add complementary enterprises on  
**[0:16:40-0:16:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:16:40):**  the farm, it's at that stage then we can go out to the market and talk to other landholders  
**[0:16:48-0:16:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:16:48):**  or other farmers and start to plan for the next 2,000, 3,000 acres regionally.  
**[0:16:55-0:16:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:16:55):**  And that will take some time to do that.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:16:58):**  So realistically, in 10 years, could we be at 10,000 acres?  
**[0:17:02-0:17:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:17:02):**  Absolutely yes.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:17:03):**  That's the next milestone.  
**[0:17:06-0:17:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:17:06):**  In terms of our modeling, what does that look like to investors?  
**[0:17:09-0:17:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:17:09):**  That's something like a two to three times return, very conservatively, because we're  
**[0:17:15-0:17:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:17:15):**  not baking in any of the complementary activities.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:17:19):**  We're not baking in carbon offsets.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:17:22):**  The whole carbon offset-  
**[0:17:23-0:17:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:17:23):**  Nice bridge.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:17:24):**  Yeah, thank you.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:17:25):**  The whole carbon offset story, for us, that's dropped straight to the bottom line and that  
**[0:17:31-0:17:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:17:31):**  can really supercharge returns.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:17:33):**  The big story is when you get to 60,000 acres, you get a lot of leverage and economies of  
**[0:17:38-0:17:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:17:38):**  scale and a lot of learning of costs in the business.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:17:41):**  So we will learn a lot in terms of what we can do, what we can't do, how we can optimize  
**[0:17:48-0:17:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:17:48):**  the business, how we can optimize revenue streams, so on and so forth.  
**[0:17:53-0:17:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:17:53):**  You could be looking at 10, 20 times your money on a 60,000 acre scale.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:17:59):**  So that's where the patient money really gets its return, but also that's where it really  
**[0:18:04-0:18:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:18:04):**  gets its impact because at that sort of scale, then you've got a big voice in terms of being  
**[0:18:10-0:18:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:18:10):**  able to demonstrate that, yes, regenerative agriculture does exactly what it said we would  
**[0:18:16-0:18:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:18:16):**  do and it probably does a host of other things that we didn't even know it was capable of  
**[0:18:20-0:18:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:18:20):**  too.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:18:21):**  So that's why you need to have a long-term horizon.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:18:25):**  So does it mean, let's say I invest, does it mean that there's a fixed time or a fixed  
**[0:18:31-0:18:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:18:31):**  return in a sense?  
**[0:18:32-0:18:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:18:32):**  Is there 10 years and then whatever came back from the 25% profit, that's great.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:18:38):**  And then we close the deal and I'm no longer part of the company or is there like in some  
**[0:18:43-0:18:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:18:43):**  other, let's say revenue share, revenue based one, okay, until 3x and then we close the  
**[0:18:48-0:18:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:18:48):**  deal or is there no end to the deal, it just continues to flow also after 10 years, mostly  
**[0:18:54-0:18:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:18:54):**  structured?  
**[0:18:55-0:18:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:18:55):**  Yeah, no, absolutely.  
**[0:18:56-0:19:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:18:56):**  I mean, personally, I would love investors to stay for the whole journey.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:19:01):**  That could be 10 years, 20 years, 30 years, 50 years.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:19:04):**  I'm hoping that regenerative agriculture in the UK is going to be around for the next few  
**[0:19:11-0:19:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:19:11):**  hundred years.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:19:12):**  So you could imagine a scenario where as an investor, you hold onto this and you pass  
**[0:19:18-0:19:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:19:18):**  it on to the next generation.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:19:20):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:19:21):**  You could also imagine a scenario where an investor, they want to exit in 10 years time  
**[0:19:27-0:19:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:19:27):**  or 15 years time or wherever it happens to be and they can sell their shares.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:19:31):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:19:32):**  And we would help to facilitate that type of transaction.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:19:35):**  And I'm imagining there's some kind of, I wouldn't say lock up, but as there's a longer,  
**[0:19:39-0:19:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:19:39):**  I mean, you will have that discussion with every investor.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:19:41):**  Look, this is a long term thing.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:19:42):**  Don't come after two years and say, please find somewhere to sell my shares.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:19:47):**  Is there any commitment they have to commit to, like at least five years or at least seven  
**[0:19:51-0:19:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:19:51):**  years to be part of the journey?  
**[0:19:53-0:19:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:19:53):**  Or do you leave that to the investor to do that?  
**[0:19:55-0:20:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:19:55):**  Like, is there any signs like, OK, I know this is long term, so at least I'm on board  
**[0:20:00-0:20:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:20:00):**  for five years and then we'll see what have you done there?  
**[0:20:02-0:20:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:20:02):**  Yeah, I mean, I think that's it's more implicit than explicit.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:20:08):**  So if you look at the financial model and you look at the pitch, you know, the first  
**[0:20:13-0:20:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:20:13):**  thousand acres, which we get to profitability and say, four years, that's just the start  
**[0:20:19-0:20:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:20:19):**  of the journey.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:20:20):**  So really, as a bare minimum, you have to be thinking in terms of four to five years.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:20:26):**  You know, if you're a foundation and you're granting money, that's kind of the first big  
**[0:20:32-0:20:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:20:32):**  milestone that you want to see us achieve.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:20:35):**  And yet that's a different type of money, obviously.  
**[0:20:38-0:20:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:20:38):**  As an investor, you know, that's obviously the first milestone you want to see us achieve.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:20:43):**  Now you want to see us achieve the next milestone, which is 10000 acres.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:20:47):**  And is that five years, six years, seven years?  
**[0:20:50-0:20:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:20:50):**  It depends.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:20:51):**  Yeah, it depends how fast things move and how well we execute.  
**[0:20:56-0:21:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:20:56):**  So as an investor, you've got to have a 10 year time horizon if you want to maximize  
**[0:21:03-0:21:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:21:03):**  both your financial return and the impact of the business.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:21:08):**  And we've had some amazing introductions from doing these podcasts with you, Kyun.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:21:13):**  Shout out to the community.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:21:15):**  Thank you for responding.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:21:16):**  Yeah, big shout out to the community.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:21:19):**  And you know, when impact investors get this stuff, who come from a private equity or a  
**[0:21:25-0:21:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:21:25):**  venture capital background, their insightfulness and the quality of their questions into, you  
**[0:21:32-0:21:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:21:32):**  know, the business model and also the way that we're structuring the business is that  
**[0:21:38-0:21:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:21:38):**  is exactly the type of investor that we want on board.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:21:42):**  You're really super smart, commercially highly intelligent, highly creative, and actually  
**[0:21:50-0:21:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:21:50):**  really, really supportive.  
**[0:21:51-0:21:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:21:51):**  So you're not getting into an argument about does your business model work or does regenerative  
**[0:21:57-0:21:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:21:57):**  agriculture work?  
**[0:21:59-0:22:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:21:59):**  You're getting really smart, supportive questions to help you do a much better job.  
**[0:22:04-0:22:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:22:04):**  And let's kind of step back, look at the big picture here, right?  
**[0:22:08-0:22:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:22:08):**  Okay, so agriculture is a big contributor to climate change, deforestation, biodiversity  
**[0:22:17-0:22:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:22:17):**  loss, water runoff, eutrophication in oceans.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:22:21):**  So if you really get that stuff, you want to see us succeed big time so we can replicate  
**[0:22:28-0:22:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:22:28):**  this model 20 times in the UK, a thousand times in Europe, a thousand times in America,  
**[0:22:35-0:22:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:22:35):**  10,000 times in Asia.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:22:36):**  So that's the kind of level of commitment that personally I'm looking for from investors.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:22:42):**  You know, somebody, people that, yeah, let's make a whole load of money and create a whole  
**[0:22:46-0:22:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:22:46):**  load of wealth, but let's also completely change the whole story about ecological capital  
**[0:22:54-0:22:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:22:54):**  creation in the UK, Europe, US and Asia.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:22:58):**  Yeah, I think it's fascinating for anybody obviously interested to reach out, but I had  
**[0:23:02-0:23:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:23:02):**  the pleasure to go through the deal room or the data room and there's a lot of information  
**[0:23:07-0:23:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:23:07):**  in there if you're interested in the discussion animal versus non-animal and regenerative  
**[0:23:13-0:23:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:23:13):**  ag on Enough is Enough, which we obviously discussed with Marcus, like the commitment  
**[0:23:16-0:23:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:23:16):**  and the level of thought, not just on the ag piece, and we discussed it a lot with the  
**[0:23:21-0:23:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:23:21):**  interview with Marcus, but also on the enterprise piece, like how to structure this for the  
**[0:23:25-0:23:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:23:25):**  long run as well.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:23:27):**  And you automatically select the type of investors that are interested in that because if you  
**[0:23:31-0:23:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:23:31):**  go through all of that and if you're not interested as you would have stopped reading a long time  
**[0:23:35-0:23:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:23:35):**  ago or stopped listening to this interview as well.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:23:37):**  So it's interesting how that's a self selecting and how much thought and work you have put  
**[0:23:42-0:23:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:23:42):**  in this on the non-farming piece before.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:23:45):**  And I'm not even talking about the processing, I'm just talking about the enterprise structures.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:23:49):**  And we have discussed it obviously, how to keep the purpose of the company and the steering  
**[0:23:53-0:23:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:23:53):**  wheel focused on the long term, which is my follow up question.  
**[0:23:57-0:24:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:23:57):**  We've discussed it often with the guys and girls of Purpose Capital, Purpose Ventures  
**[0:24:01-0:24:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:24:01):**  and others like how to make sure that not a majority of the equity shareholders after  
**[0:24:07-0:24:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:24:07):**  six years because they changed their mind or they donated, they inherited the shares  
**[0:24:12-0:24:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:24:12):**  from whoever or got it and suddenly say, no, actually let's sell all this land and build  
**[0:24:16-0:24:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:24:16):**  a lot of villas because development is maybe easier.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:24:19):**  So as you have pivoted partly to more equity and profit share model, has that purpose piece  
**[0:24:26-0:24:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:24:26):**  changed and how is that, I'm imagining, not so implicit but more explicit, like making  
**[0:24:31-0:24:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:24:31):**  sure this is a 20, 30 plus year thing and not if you change your mind in six years or  
**[0:24:36-0:24:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:24:36):**  Mark changes his mind or some of the shareholders say, okay, let's build a really big amusement  
**[0:24:41-0:24:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:24:41):**  park and let's copy Disneyland in the UK.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:24:46):**  Has that changed or not with this new raising?  
**[0:24:49-0:24:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:24:49):**  Very good question.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:24:50):**  I think we've really sharpened up on the governance and how the different stakeholders in the  
**[0:24:57-0:25:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:24:57):**  business and the enterprise are represented.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:25:01):**  So effectively you've got investors, founders, employees, community.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:25:08):**  So we really think it's very important that the community of shoppers have a voice in  
**[0:25:14-0:25:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:25:14):**  the business, not just from the point of view of it's a good marketing tactic, but from  
**[0:25:20-0:25:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:25:20):**  the point of view of really helping to create a close connection to where does my food come  
**[0:25:26-0:25:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:25:26):**  from and how is it made and how is the land affected and just really helping to bring  
**[0:25:36-0:25:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:25:36):**  the shoppers into the whole equation of how do we grow food and what does it mean to run  
**[0:25:42-0:25:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:25:42):**  the business.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:25:43):**  And of course the employees is the other stakeholder.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:25:47):**  So the purpose lock of the business being a regenerative enterprise that grows nutrient  
**[0:25:52-0:25:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:25:52):**  dense food and fiber and regenerating soils that stays the same and that is enshrined  
**[0:25:58-0:26:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:25:58):**  in the articles of association.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:26:01):**  So you'd have to have nothing short of a revolution with pitchforks and guns to change the purpose  
**[0:26:09-0:26:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:26:09):**  of the organization.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:26:11):**  So that would be an extremely unlikely event that the purpose of the organization would  
**[0:26:16-0:26:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:26:16):**  change because A, it's the culture of the organization that is incredibly important.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:26:22):**  At the end of the day governance is incredibly important as a check and a balance in order  
**[0:26:26-0:26:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:26:26):**  to steer the ship.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:26:29):**  But in my view in the organizations that I've worked in it's the culture that you create  
**[0:26:36-0:26:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:26:36):**  that really means that the purpose lives and flourishes in the people in the company.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:26:43):**  And part of that is there's a reason why Kirstie, Wayne and myself alongside Marcus and Mark  
**[0:26:50-0:26:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:26:50):**  are together and that's because it's not a textbook exercise for us.  
**[0:26:55-0:27:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:26:55):**  It's a real embodiment of values and it's the embodiment of values that really gives  
**[0:27:01-0:27:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:27:01):**  the quality assurance to the business in terms of its purpose.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:27:06):**  So you can think of it as a calling and more than a vocation it's a calling.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:27:12):**  It's something that we feel very strongly about and that's what really guides the purpose  
**[0:27:18-0:27:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:27:18):**  of the organization as well as having the governance structures in place in the articles  
**[0:27:23-0:27:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:27:23):**  of association and in the structure of the business and in the way the different stakeholders  
**[0:27:28-0:27:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:27:28):**  get to vote to ensure that that purpose evolves and lives on over time.  
**[0:27:34-0:27:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:27:34):**  And just to push back a bit because the calling obviously is great and the culture is amazing  
**[0:27:39-0:27:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:27:39):**  but those things can change especially we're talking about a 10, 20, 30 year movement almost  
**[0:27:45-0:27:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:27:45):**  and we've seen that in the past like companies that started great and at some point things  
**[0:27:50-0:27:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:27:50):**  change especially when there's a lot of money at stake.  
**[0:27:53-0:27:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:27:53):**  So I think unless the documents of association cannot be changed to a non-regenerative or  
**[0:27:59-0:28:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:27:59):**  to a de-regenerative or extractive way unless there is a stop at the end like okay this  
**[0:28:04-0:28:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:28:04):**  is the bare minimum that this should do for 100 years at least.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:28:08):**  Things always change unfortunately or fortunately I mean things shift and this is long term  
**[0:28:12-0:28:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:28:12):**  stuff so unless there's a legal backstop I think that's what purpose has been pushing  
**[0:28:17-0:28:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:28:17):**  for like making sure that even if somebody comes and puts a billion on the table stuff  
**[0:28:22-0:28:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:28:22):**  is still didn't change because there is a golden chair or there is a vote that makes  
**[0:28:27-0:28:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:28:27):**  sure that okay we can never go to development of this 1000 acres like that's at least it  
**[0:28:33-0:28:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:28:33):**  should always be farmed regeneratively and these are the things that we consider regeneratively.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:28:37):**  Whatever you're also going to do things change maybe in 10 years we have a very different  
**[0:28:41-0:28:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:28:41):**  outlook on animals or very different outlook on processing or very different outlook on  
**[0:28:45-0:28:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:28:45):**  etc etc but that's the core needs to be preserved.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:28:49):**  But it's something we challenge with because of course we can say at the moment okay this  
**[0:28:52-0:28:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:28:52):**  are the equity shares this is the votes but also that changes over time and things shift  
**[0:28:56-0:29:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:28:56):**  and especially as we're looking long term and many have experienced that I think that  
**[0:29:01-0:29:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:29:01):**  the culture shifts and at some point suddenly you are against the 51 vote and things that  
**[0:29:05-0:29:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:29:05):**  never would be able to change are suddenly changed and that would be a shame.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:29:10):**  So just to push back a bit on that like it's we need to really think the long term here  
**[0:29:14-0:29:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:29:14):**  and make sure it's even goes beyond us like it goes beyond you guys the team it goes beyond  
**[0:29:19-0:29:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:29:19):**  like that not I don't know if you have children with your children at some point inherit the  
**[0:29:23-0:29:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:29:23):**  shares and say yeah we don't care but they probably do but we just want to develop it  
**[0:29:27-0:29:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:29:27):**  because somebody comes with a lot of money and it changes lives.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:29:32):**  So it's that making sure that even in the rarest cases of the opportunity of course  
**[0:29:36-0:29:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:29:36):**  pitchforks and guns that we cannot work on that but all the other legal loopholes should  
**[0:29:42-0:29:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:29:42):**  be at least closed.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:29:43):**  Yeah I mean as far as I know there is a purpose lock in the business which enshrines the purpose  
**[0:29:51-0:29:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:29:51):**  of the business as far as we possibly can in terms of what a legal document looks like.  
**[0:29:59-0:30:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:29:59):**  So you know you need to have a talk with the lawyers on this one in order to fully explore  
**[0:30:06-0:30:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:30:06):**  and investigate all the potential loopholes and mechanisms for applying pressure to change  
**[0:30:15-0:30:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:30:15):**  because you can never 100% guarantee something that's impossible.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:30:19):**  No no of course we just have to rule out all the known knowns that okay the rest we'll  
**[0:30:25-0:30:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:30:25):**  see.  
**[0:30:26-0:30:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:30:26):**  Yeah so I mean you know the you take your scenario of you know hang on a second we've  
**[0:30:31-0:30:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:30:31):**  got all this 60,000 acres of prime agricultural land which is suddenly there's an influx of  
**[0:30:40-0:30:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:30:40):**  10 million people projected to come to the UK because of climate chaos right and suddenly  
**[0:30:45-0:30:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:30:45):**  that regenerative land looks very exciting to build on in you know sort of 50 years time  
**[0:30:52-0:30:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:30:52):**  or something like that.  
**[0:30:54-0:30:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:30:54):**  You'd have to have a two-third majority of all stakeholders to change the purpose of  
**[0:30:59-0:31:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:30:59):**  the organization.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:31:01):**  So that's a very high bar to get over.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:31:05):**  Is there a reason why it's not a hundred or that just was impossible?  
**[0:31:09-0:31:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:31:09):**  Like a unanimous vote for change of the purpose.  
**[0:31:13-0:31:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:31:13):**  If you have to have a hundred percent vote for everything then you're never going to  
**[0:31:17-0:31:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:31:17):**  do anything.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:31:18):**  No no just for the core purpose like it can never be built on or something.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:31:21):**  I'm curious about it I mean it's a very geeky subject probably but very curious about that  
**[0:31:27-0:31:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:31:27):**  purpose lock and two-thirds is a lot but still sometimes possible.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:31:32):**  I mean you see it with our organization but let's be conscious of time as well and I want  
**[0:31:37-0:31:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:31:37):**  to ask some follow-up questions on the carbon piece actually that you would say a strong  
**[0:31:43-0:31:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:31:43):**  opinion but quite a strong opinion on.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:31:44):**  Like why do you say it's an interesting distraction but a good business model is key?  
**[0:31:49-0:31:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:31:49):**  Well I mean if you sort of take you know why is there a first question why is there a carbon  
**[0:31:55-0:31:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:31:55):**  price and what is the carbon price?  
**[0:31:58-0:32:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:31:58):**  So it's a subsidy so a carbon price is basically a subsidy to enable entrepreneurs to take  
**[0:32:10-0:32:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:32:10):**  risk or to force corporates to change the way they do business and offset their carbon  
**[0:32:17-0:32:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:32:17):**  taxes.  
**[0:32:18-0:32:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:32:18):**  So it's a quota subsidy tax incentive framework and mechanism so sort of at the margin it's  
**[0:32:28-0:32:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:32:28):**  intended to incentivize change but it's not a strategy.  
**[0:32:33-0:32:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:32:33):**  Carbon tax is not a strategy we're putting something like 50 billion tons of carbon dioxide  
**[0:32:40-0:32:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:32:40):**  into the atmosphere every year so a subsidy that might be one dollars five dollars ten dollars seventy dollars per ton of carbon dioxide isn't fundamentally going to change anything.  
**[0:32:54-0:33:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:32:54):**  You have to have an industrial strategy and businesses that are doing the work intrinsically  
**[0:33:05-0:33:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:33:05):**  that the ecological benefits or the creation of ecological capital is built into the business  
**[0:33:13-0:33:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:33:13):**  model without a reliance on subsidies.  
**[0:33:16-0:33:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:33:16):**  That is the driver of change so the subsidies are really nice things to have at the margin  
**[0:33:22-0:33:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:33:22):**  you know brilliant for our business but we never designed a business that needed to rely  
**[0:33:28-0:33:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:33:28):**  on subsidies in order to be effective economically and ecologically.  
**[0:33:34-0:33:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:33:34):**  But if you look at the renewable energy space until recently in some places and some places  
**[0:33:39-0:33:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:33:39):**  still were reliant on some kind of direct or indirect subsidies to get going and created  
**[0:33:44-0:33:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:33:44):**  this industry that now is competing head to head.  
**[0:33:48-0:33:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:33:48):**  Obviously there are a lot of subsidies for the fossil fuel industry and a lot of subsidies  
**[0:33:51-0:33:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:33:51):**  for the agriculture industry so maybe we should just take them away.  
**[0:33:53-0:33:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:33:53):**  I mean there could be an answer to my follow-up question but so there is in that transition  
**[0:33:58-0:34:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:33:58):**  phase as we get going and people start doing things at scale do you see a role for it or  
**[0:34:03-0:34:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:34:03):**  is it a I wouldn't say waste of time but I mean to build a market in that place to do  
**[0:34:09-0:34:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:34:09):**  the research to do the measurement it's a lot of folk I mean you it's a lot of distraction  
**[0:34:14-0:34:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:34:14):**  potentially as well like do you think it's a distraction even in a transition phase or  
**[0:34:17-0:34:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:34:17):**  is there a role for it to kick start a lot of hectares to get going or acres?  
**[0:34:21-0:34:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:34:21):**  Yeah well okay so from the point of view of New Foundation Farms you know Steve Jobs didn't  
**[0:34:28-0:34:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:34:28):**  invent the iPhone by thinking about Blackberry right so my belief is that we need to focus  
**[0:34:36-0:34:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:34:36):**  on what we're doing and not worry about policy carbon prices other business models you know  
**[0:34:44-0:34:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:34:44):**  that that's good stuff to know and it'll become more important in the future but right now  
**[0:34:49-0:34:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:34:49):**  our focus is on having a successful capital raise and executing on the first five years  
**[0:34:54-0:35:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:34:54):**  of our business plan regardless I'm not the best person to talk about carbon taxes and  
**[0:35:01-0:35:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:35:01):**  subsidies and things like that because you know I'm an economist I've got a masters in  
**[0:35:05-0:35:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:35:05):**  finance and investment I'm a holistic scientist and you know I started an NGO in the States  
**[0:35:10-0:35:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:35:10):**  called the Climate Map which kind of looks at a lot of these issues about how do you  
**[0:35:15-0:35:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:35:15):**  scale impactful projects that are you know going to draw down gigatons so you know we  
**[0:35:20-0:35:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:35:20):**  could do a whole new kind of community platform on that and suck up a lot of it I'm not looking  
**[0:35:26-0:35:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:35:26):**  it really is super important but it's got to be joined up it's got to be holistic there  
**[0:35:31-0:35:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:35:31):**  has to be an ecosystem there's got to be big corporates making the change you know like  
**[0:35:37-0:35:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:35:37):**  Microsoft Bill Gates's breakthrough ventures all the stuff that Jeremy Grantham is doing  
**[0:35:43-0:35:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:35:43):**  there's extraordinary activity at the venture capital level going on in the States at the  
**[0:35:49-0:35:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:35:49):**  moment you know there's Joe Biden's Green Deal there's a vast universe of things happening  
**[0:35:54-0:36:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:35:54):**  so really just to kind of like focus on the carbon price it's just a piece in the puzzle  
**[0:36:01-0:36:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:36:01):**  yeah it's a really important piece of the puzzle as a subsidy in order to incentivize  
**[0:36:05-0:36:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:36:05):**  capital to take risk and generate new business models for sure there's no doubt about that  
**[0:36:10-0:36:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:36:10):**  but in terms of new foundation farms the regenerative agriculture piece is so strong on its own in  
**[0:36:18-0:36:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:36:18):**  terms of its ability to regenerate soil and ecosystems and the business model that we've  
**[0:36:25-0:36:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:36:25):**  created in terms of cutting out all the middlemen and going direct to consumer that really bumps  
**[0:36:31-0:36:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:36:31):**  the margins of the business right up we don't need to think about do we draw down eight  
**[0:36:38-0:36:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:36:38):**  tons per acre at twenty dollars or is it three tons per acre at a hundred dollars we will  
**[0:36:44-0:36:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:36:44):**  do that piece of work in a year's time and we'll work with who we think are the best  
**[0:36:49-0:36:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:36:49):**  people to really push the whole agenda forward for sure absolutely that's really super exciting  
**[0:36:55-0:37:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:36:55):**  but it's not our focus right now and to be conscious of your time and end with a few  
**[0:37:01-0:37:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:37:01):**  questions I always like to ask I wouldn't say that I wouldn't call them fire questions  
**[0:37:04-0:37:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:37:04):**  but definitely sort of rapid what do you believe to be true about regenerative agriculture  
**[0:37:10-0:37:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:37:10):**  that others don't where are you contrarian definitely inspired by John Kempf that usually  
**[0:37:14-0:37:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:37:14):**  asked this question in a slightly different form yeah I would say my belief is that you  
**[0:37:21-0:37:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:37:21):**  can produce a much higher yield than conventional agriculture and when you say yield is that  
**[0:37:27-0:37:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:37:27):**  like weight or are you looking at calories and nutrients how do you define yield the  
**[0:37:33-0:37:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:37:33):**  whole bushel so nutrient density vitamins weights protein whatever it is that you need  
**[0:37:43-0:37:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:37:43):**  to kind of feed the world my belief is that regenerative agriculture is superior across  
**[0:37:49-0:37:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:37:49):**  all dimensions dimensions compared to conventional agriculture and if you could change one thing  
**[0:37:55-0:38:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:37:55):**  so you have a magic wand you can change one thing in agriculture in the food industry  
**[0:38:01-0:38:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:38:01):**  as well I mean you can choose what would that be it would be mindset mindset is the biggest  
**[0:38:06-0:38:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:38:06):**  barrier to change absolutely so if I could wave the magic wand and I could get people  
**[0:38:12-0:38:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:38:12):**  to think ecologically as well as economically that is the change that I would make the real  
**[0:38:18-0:38:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:38:18):**  estate between our ears yes exactly absolutely 100% there's you know once you once you've  
**[0:38:25-0:38:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:38:25):**  got undergone once you've had a mindset shift and you have that ecological lens you realize  
**[0:38:32-0:38:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:38:32):**  that is absolutely the highest order which you can operate you know at least as we know  
**[0:38:38-0:38:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:38:38):**  as far as we know as humans I mean I'm sure there are levels of being able to operate  
**[0:38:43-0:38:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:38:43):**  but I mean effectively what it does is the question you've always got to ask yourself  
**[0:38:48-0:38:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:38:48):**  is am I generating ecological capital or am I destroying ecological capital and like when  
**[0:38:55-0:38:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:38:55):**  we had a population of one or two billion on the earth destroying ecological capital  
**[0:38:59-0:39:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:38:59):**  wasn't such a big deal because there was plenty of spare capacity for our ecological systems  
**[0:39:04-0:39:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:39:04):**  to restore themselves so we could get away with it it's fine with seven billion people  
**[0:39:09-0:39:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:39:09):**  on the planet and everybody wanting to have the a meat-rich diet two cars foreign holidays  
**[0:39:17-0:39:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:39:17):**  you can't not think in those times anymore because the consequences are too dire and  
**[0:39:25-0:39:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:39:25):**  a final question I always say final but it never is if tomorrow you'll be or actually  
**[0:39:29-0:39:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:39:29):**  this morning as well in charge of a one billion dollar or one billion pounds sterling I don't  
**[0:39:33-0:39:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:39:33):**  care about the currency investment funds you have a long-term view you could have you could  
**[0:39:37-0:39:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:39:37):**  be super short as well if you want to but it is an investment fund meaning we're looking  
**[0:39:42-0:39:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:39:42):**  not to grant but to invest could be zero percent return I mean you're free to choose what would  
**[0:39:47-0:39:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:39:47):**  you focus on what would be your priorities to where and how to put the money to work  
**[0:39:52-0:40:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:39:52):**  yeah I knew this question was coming and my first answer is like a billion pounds isn't  
**[0:40:00-0:40:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:40:00):**  that much these days can we sort of can we look at I asked this question because I'm  
**[0:40:04-0:40:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:40:04):**  interested in priorities like what would you focus on so let's I mean we've seen the inflation  
**[0:40:08-0:40:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:40:08):**  over the lifetime of this podcast so this apparently a billion is that not that much  
**[0:40:13-0:40:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:40:13):**  anymore so let's go for a hundred a hundred billion what would you do okay so like if  
**[0:40:17-0:40:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:40:17):**  I had a hundred billion I mean I would do something like a breakthrough ventures which  
**[0:40:24-0:40:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:40:24):**  is Bill Gates's kind of answer to scaling technologies that are going to deal with drawing  
**[0:40:31-0:40:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:40:31):**  down carbon dioxide and I would focus on regenerative entrepreneurs so I would have a you know a  
**[0:40:38-0:40:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:40:38):**  hundred billion pound fund that is finding the regenerative entrepreneurs that are applying  
**[0:40:44-0:40:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:40:44):**  systems thinking to solving ecological value creation and human wealth creation and I would  
**[0:40:51-0:40:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:40:51):**  throw a lot of money at that yeah I think a perfect answer I love the breakthrough ventures  
**[0:40:55-0:41:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:40:55):**  I would definitely link it below what I always miss is I mean for an engineer and technologists  
**[0:41:02-0:41:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:41:02):**  it's like the place of man in nature like our role in and the nature based solutions  
**[0:41:07-0:41:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:41:07):**  for which is a horrible name but if you see what they fund and if you see how Gates talks  
**[0:41:12-0:41:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:41:12):**  about agriculture I think there's a lot to learn I would love to discuss with him here  
**[0:41:17-0:41:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:41:17):**  in the podcast if anybody has an intro definitely let me know but if you I think there is that  
**[0:41:21-0:41:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:41:21):**  kind of brainpower we need in regenerative agriculture and it seems like he's still very  
**[0:41:27-0:41:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:41:27):**  far or at least the foundation and everything they do and the breakthrough ventures etc  
**[0:41:32-0:41:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:41:32):**  is very far from that but that's from the outside I've never had obviously that discussion  
**[0:41:36-0:41:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:41:36):**  with him I'm looking forward to like the potential he did tweet something a year ago I think  
**[0:41:41-0:41:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:41:41):**  on soil etc so there's some interest but then the approach is always not very holistic I  
**[0:41:47-0:41:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:41:47):**  think to say the least yeah I mean I haven't dived really deeply into that side of Bill  
**[0:41:57-0:42:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:41:57):**  Gates's life so I haven't really got a strong answer you know I I mean whenever you talk  
**[0:42:05-0:42:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:42:05):**  about billionaires and their agendas it always becomes a very contentious issue I think the  
**[0:42:10-0:42:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:42:10):**  direction of travel is good the more people are talking about these conversations and  
**[0:42:16-0:42:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:42:16):**  diving deeper into what regenerative agriculture actually means and how you can pursue scaling  
**[0:42:24-0:42:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:42:24):**  strategies that are good for communities good for human health good for gut health good  
**[0:42:30-0:42:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:42:30):**  for soil health good for biodiversity good for equality of ownership the better yeah  
**[0:42:36-0:42:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:42:36):**  I'm looking forward to discussion at some point we'll have that here I want to thank  
**[0:42:40-0:42:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:42:40):**  you so much for now Paul we'll have Mark on in a second to dive a bit deeper into the  
**[0:42:45-0:42:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:42:45):**  investor reactions to let's say the broadening of focus or I wouldn't call it a pivot because  
**[0:42:50-0:42:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:42:50):**  it's way too hard but to talk about the funding piece but for now when I thank you for your  
**[0:42:55-0:43:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:42:55):**  time your sharing of your journey and your discussion until here brilliant real pleasure  
**[0:43:00-0:43:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:43:00):**  thanks so much for the airtime really appreciate it so we have Mark Drouot back on the show  
**[0:43:06-0:43:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:43:06):**  together with Paul obviously to just reflect a bit on the reaction of investors to this  
**[0:43:12-0:43:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:43:12):**  shift in fundraising to more equity piece more risk-taking and profit sharing so Mark  
**[0:43:17-0:43:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:43:17):**  welcome back and let's dive straight into that what was the reaction on the floor on  
**[0:43:22-0:43:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:43:22):**  the fundraising road show that you've been doing obviously from your home mostly but  
**[0:43:26-0:43:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:43:26):**  what has been the reaction on zoom basically hello again yeah the reaction has been really  
**[0:43:31-0:43:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:43:31):**  interesting because what we've realized is fundamentally people who are investing for  
**[0:43:36-0:43:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:43:36):**  impact or using their money to create change in the world are hardwired for risk so going  
**[0:43:43-0:43:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:43:43):**  from a preference share with a fixed return to an ordinary share with no guaranteed return  
**[0:43:50-0:43:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:43:50):**  but all of the excitement of a journey and the upside that's possible it just lands much  
**[0:43:55-0:44:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:43:55):**  more easily so it's much easier we're finding for people to say yes and has the conversation  
**[0:44:02-0:44:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:44:02):**  then shift like the energy of people being interested because of course an impact piece  
**[0:44:06-0:44:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:44:06):**  and the company piece nothing changed and people are either excited or not and I'm imagining  
**[0:44:11-0:44:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:44:11):**  if they're excited they will continue talking but but actually question to both of you Paul  
**[0:44:14-0:44:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:44:14):**  and Mark has that have you seen like the last few weeks since you've been changing this  
**[0:44:19-0:44:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:44:19):**  and putting this into place like a different kind of engagement or different kind of leaning  
**[0:44:24-0:44:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:44:24):**  in I'm actually doing that now nobody can see it but leaning in of investors or just  
**[0:44:29-0:44:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:44:29):**  like people self-select and the ones that are super excited about this are still the  
**[0:44:32-0:44:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:44:32):**  ones you talk to and or have there been some people that are interested in the preferred  
**[0:44:37-0:44:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:44:37):**  shares and are now no longer interested what has been the feeling around in terms of leaning  
**[0:44:41-0:44:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:44:41):**  in getting to let's say the next phase of potentially commitments and obviously investments  
**[0:44:45-0:44:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:44:45):**  as well I'd say first of all what's fascinating is that there hasn't been a single person  
**[0:44:49-0:44:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:44:49):**  who was interested in the fixed return preference shares who said thanks but now you want to  
**[0:44:55-0:45:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:44:55):**  give me a general share in the ordinary shares in the company and a full share of the upside  
**[0:45:00-0:45:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:45:00):**  there's been nobody who said no that's not interesting so it hasn't turned anyone off  
**[0:45:05-0:45:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:45:05):**  on the turning people on side from the beginning of our journey sort of eight ten weeks ago  
**[0:45:11-0:45:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:45:11):**  we had a number of people who said just look I love what you're doing but what I need you  
**[0:45:14-0:45:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:45:14):**  to do is if you want my money you're going to have to give me a share of the upside because  
**[0:45:20-0:45:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:45:20):**  that's what I do that's how I invest so what's happened is this open the door to a whole  
**[0:45:24-0:45:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:45:24):**  raft of people who had previously said I love it but you know you don't fit my investment  
**[0:45:28-0:45:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:45:28):**  profile yeah and absolutely and I also think not only has it released that extra amount  
**[0:45:36-0:45:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:45:36):**  of energy with investors it's also galvanized the team at new foundation farms too so in  
**[0:45:42-0:45:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:45:42):**  that sense it's definitely a win-win so there's more energy for the reins on all sides and  
**[0:45:49-0:45:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:45:49):**  in terms of timeline what has changed or has that changed at all so the timeline up until  
**[0:45:55-0:46:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:45:55):**  now we have been talking to people on the basis of saying this is the offer and we're  
**[0:46:01-0:46:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:46:01):**  talking to a wide range of different kinds of investor with a view to understanding what  
**[0:46:05-0:46:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:46:05):**  makes sense the result of that that cycle is now ending and so our expectation is that  
**[0:46:12-0:46:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:46:12):**  within two weeks from now the offer will change from draft to a document that says the offer  
**[0:46:19-0:46:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:46:19):**  opens on date X which should be around the middle of May and closes on date Y which will  
**[0:46:25-0:46:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:46:25):**  have an initial close at the end of June so we're shifting from conversations about decision  
**[0:46:33-0:46:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:46:33):**  to invest do you like what we're saying to right this is now the journey are you in or  
**[0:46:37-0:46:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:46:37):**  out and we are now filling the book and the ambition is that that will allow us to acquiring  
**[0:46:44-0:46:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:46:44):**  land and be on the first thousand acres by the end of the summer very very interesting  
**[0:46:49-0:46:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:46:49):**  and just to wrap up we discussed in the interview if you're still here with us you for sure  
**[0:46:54-0:46:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:46:54):**  heard it a lot on governance structure and I was pushing a bit on the purpose sled and  
**[0:46:59-0:47:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:46:59):**  how to make sure there's a purpose locker we just we discussed it quite extensively  
**[0:47:04-0:47:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:47:04):**  but I'm very interested in I didn't dive deeper into it so I can ask now again on the two  
**[0:47:08-0:47:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:47:08):**  thirds so Paul mentioned there has to be a two-third vote majority vote of all stakeholders  
**[0:47:14-0:47:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:47:14):**  individually so all the pieces and I would love to know a bit more on that to change  
**[0:47:17-0:47:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:47:17):**  the purpose of the company but Mark you are deep into that as well what does that two  
**[0:47:21-0:47:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:47:21):**  third mean and why is that two third two thirds is really important if you look at the the  
**[0:47:27-0:47:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:47:27):**  constitutions of most countries around the world most written constitutions they basically  
**[0:47:31-0:47:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:47:31):**  say for for general decision-making 50% vote of whoever's got to make the decision is fine  
**[0:47:37-0:47:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:47:37):**  but if it's something big and fundamental it requires a two-thirds majority of everybody  
**[0:47:43-0:47:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:47:43):**  so in this case the way we structured it basically says you need a two-thirds vote of the employees  
**[0:47:49-0:47:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:47:49):**  and to change any article in the company's articles two-thirds vote the employees and  
**[0:47:53-0:47:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:47:53):**  a two-thirds vote of the investors or the funders and a two-thirds vote of society and  
**[0:47:58-0:48:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:47:58):**  for as long as the founders are around a two-thirds vote of the founders and a two-thirds vote  
**[0:48:03-0:48:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:48:03):**  of the board now that's a very very high bar but it does mean that if in two generations  
**[0:48:08-0:48:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:48:08):**  time people wake up and say actually this particular article or this statement of purpose  
**[0:48:13-0:48:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:48:13):**  isn't right and we need to move it on then you can and so you don't hold society you  
**[0:48:19-0:48:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:48:19):**  don't two generations time to an absolute specific that we thought was really clever  
**[0:48:24-0:48:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:48:24):**  right now yeah it gives you the chances thank you so much for elaborating on that and thank  
**[0:48:29-0:48:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:48:29):**  you both for coming on for allowing us to follow this journey and be sort of flying  
**[0:48:34-0:48:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:48:34):**  the war on some of these things and looking forward to continue doing that obviously and  
**[0:48:39-0:48:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:48:39):**  wishing you a great day today and looking forward to the next one and have a regenerative

**[0:51:57-0:52:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:51:57):**  We're gonna look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:52:02-0:52:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/paul-pizzala#t=0:52:02):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to

## 179 Mariko Thorbecke - Let's focus on making agriculture fossil fuel free  
**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?

**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:00:14):**  If you care about the climate you stop eating beef.  
**[0:00:17-0:00:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:00:17):**  For sure you've seen these kind of headlines and as a listener of this podcast you know  
**[0:00:20-0:00:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:00:20):**  the reality is much more nuanced and way more complex.  
**[0:00:24-0:00:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:00:24):**  Today we dive deep into the research side of regenerative agriculture and I feel confident  
**[0:00:29-0:00:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:00:29):**  to say that most of the research, if not all, you've seen about the climate impact of agriculture  
**[0:00:34-0:00:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:00:34):**  is completely wrong.  
**[0:00:35-0:00:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:00:35):**  For instance, did you know that most life cycle assessments, or LCAs, that's our current  
**[0:00:39-0:00:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:00:39):**  standard to compare the environmental impact of products to each other, never took into  
**[0:00:43-0:00:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:00:43):**  consideration the soil carbon sequestration potential of agriculture, so it only looked  
**[0:00:48-0:00:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:00:48):**  at the emission side of things.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:00:50):**  And as we'll discover today that is extremely, extremely simplified.  
**[0:00:53-0:00:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:00:53):**  Or the amazing topic of CO2 equivalent, which tries to boil everything down to one number  
**[0:00:57-0:01:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:00:57):**  and doesn't look at the differences between methane, CO2, fossil carbon, etc.  
**[0:01:02-0:01:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:01:02):**  And you might have seen these titles of a few articles a few years ago about claiming  
**[0:01:05-0:01:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:01:05):**  that beef and other animal protein can be farmed carbon positively or negatively depending  
**[0:01:10-0:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:01:10):**  on your point of view.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:01:11):**  Where did this research come from and how is it done and most importantly what are the  
**[0:01:15-0:01:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:01:15):**  challenges, what are the pieces still missing in this life cycle assessment world and how  
**[0:01:20-0:01:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:01:20):**  can we make this type of research more robust.  
**[0:01:23-0:01:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:01:23):**  Enjoy!  
**[0:01:24-0:01:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:01:24):**  This is the Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food podcast, Investing as if the Planet  
**[0:01:31-0:01:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:01:31):**  Mattered, where we talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:01:35-0:01:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:01:35):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:01:41-0:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:01:41):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:01:45):**  Why my focus on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:48-0:01:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:01:48):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:52-0:01:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:01:52):**  our land and our sea, grow our food, what we eat, wear and consume.  
**[0:01:56-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:01:56):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:02:00-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:02:00):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.

**[0:02:24-0:02:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:02:24):**  Welcome to another interview today with Mariko Torbeck, independent consultant bridging between  
**[0:02:32-0:02:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:02:32):**  corporate climate and net zero commitments and regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:02:35):**  Welcome Mariko.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:02:36):**  Thanks, Colin.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:02:37):**  Thanks for having me.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:02:38):**  And maybe some people won't recognize your name, but I've definitely seen your work on  
**[0:02:44-0:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:02:44):**  the lifecycle assessment pieces and especially looking for the first time in the world to  
**[0:02:49-0:02:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:02:49):**  do soil carbon into multi-stack species operations, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:02:55-0:03:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:02:55):**  But to start with a personal question, when did your fascination for soil or how did you  
**[0:03:01-0:03:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:03:01):**  roll into the lifecycle assessment space focused on regenerative agriculture?  
**[0:03:05-0:03:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:03:05):**  What was that?  
**[0:03:06-0:03:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:03:06):**  Do you remember how you got into this space?  
**[0:03:08-0:03:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:03:08):**  Because you can do life cycle assessments and this kind of research anywhere or in many,  
**[0:03:13-0:03:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:03:13):**  many other places and ag is definitely not the first place people think about.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:03:16):**  And somehow you ended up working mostly on this.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:03:20):**  How did that happen?  
**[0:03:21-0:03:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:03:21):**  Yeah, I mean, for me personally, I would say it's really been for the love of food.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:03:27):**  My husband and I have a two acre micro farm where we have dairy goats and chickens and  
**[0:03:34-0:03:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:03:34):**  ducks and a really big garden.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:03:37):**  I think at this point, many people know that food and health are intricately connected.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:03:42):**  I think working in nature and with nature and mental health are intricately connected.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:03:51):**  And I think that a big part of what I enjoy is kind of bridging between the sort of small  
**[0:03:59-0:04:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:03:59):**  scale, having a little agricultural sandbox area in my own home and figuring out how does  
**[0:04:05-0:04:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:04:05):**  that then scale globally and within the context of what a lot of the global food and ag companies  
**[0:04:13-0:04:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:04:13):**  are looking at, which is typically using LCA or life cycle assessment as a tool to better  
**[0:04:19-0:04:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:04:19):**  understand where the impacts and opportunities lie within agriculture.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:04:26):**  And farming yourself as well on a small scale, but nonetheless farming, what's been the biggest  
**[0:04:32-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:04:32):**  surprise or the biggest lessons learned doing this yourself and not just, quote unquote,  
**[0:04:39-0:04:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:04:39):**  obviously researching this from a distance with your academic hat on?  
**[0:04:44-0:04:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:04:44):**  Yeah, I mean, maybe it's no surprise, but I think one thing we've definitely discovered  
**[0:04:50-0:04:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:04:50):**  in the last three years is that the best laid plans almost never come to fruition.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:04:57):**  But there are always important lessons to be learned along the way.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:05:05):**  I mean, a few examples this year has been absolute insanity with the highly pathogenic  
**[0:05:12-0:05:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:05:12):**  avian influenza that's been going around the US.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:05:16):**  So I had my entire rotational grazing plan in place for the goats, the ducks, and the  
**[0:05:28-0:05:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:05:28):**  chickens.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:05:29):**  And then all of a sudden we were basically told that we need to quarantine all of our  
**[0:05:32-0:05:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:05:32):**  birds and keep them confined inside.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:05:35):**  So that's an example of where things didn't go to plan.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:05:40):**  But I think that soil health and really understanding the interactions between the livestock, the  
**[0:05:50-0:05:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:05:50):**  plants, the soil, and as well, just there's so many things to learn about even like parasite  
**[0:05:56-0:06:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:05:56):**  management and livestock management that we've definitely learned a lot in the last three  
**[0:06:02-0:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:06:02):**  years.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:06:03):**  Made several mistakes, but every year we see some really good improvements to what we're  
**[0:06:07-0:06:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:06:07):**  doing.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:06:09):**  And just to look at that, I think many people in this space saw some of your coming out  
**[0:06:17-0:06:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:06:17):**  and now I think two or three years ago on white oak pastures.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:06:21):**  And I think the first LCA is honestly looking at a larger regenerative system and got very  
**[0:06:27-0:06:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:06:27):**  excited when they saw the infographics that you could store this amount of carbon.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:06:30):**  And this was done when you were working at QANTIS and I think paid for by General Mills.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:06:36):**  Can you summarize?  
**[0:06:37-0:06:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:06:37):**  I mean, I will link below obviously the papers, which I recommend everybody to read and go  
**[0:06:41-0:06:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:06:41):**  deeper into this just to understand the dynamics and limitations and the opportunities, et  
**[0:06:46-0:06:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:06:46):**  cetera.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:06:47):**  But can you summarize it in a few sentences?  
**[0:06:48-0:06:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:06:48):**  What was the body of work?  
**[0:06:50-0:06:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:06:50):**  Why is it so unique?  
**[0:06:51-0:06:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:06:51):**  And then we'll go to the outcomes as well and what it tells us and what it doesn't tell  
**[0:06:55-0:06:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:06:55):**  us.  
**[0:06:56-0:06:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:06:56):**  Yeah.  
**[0:06:57-0:07:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:06:57):**  And summarizing all of it in a few sentences might be a bit challenging.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:07:00):**  A few more is fine.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:07:01):**  We have time.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:07:02):**  Yeah.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:07:03):**  I mean, this work, the bulk of it was done back in 2018.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:07:08):**  So that's I guess around four years ago now.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:07:12):**  And basically at that point in time, most companies were leveraging life cycle assessment  
**[0:07:19-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:07:19):**  to better understand the sort of impacts and opportunities within agriculture.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:07:26):**  However, one of the challenges with life cycle assessment at the time was that it was basically  
**[0:07:32-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:07:32):**  a tool that was quantifying or estimating emissions associated with agriculture and  
**[0:07:40-0:07:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:07:40):**  not looking at, you know, carbon's part of a cycle.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:07:43):**  So there's emissions of carbon, but then there's also carbon sequestration and carbon sinks  
**[0:07:49-0:07:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:07:49):**  such as in soil and biomass.  
**[0:07:50-0:08:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:07:50):**  So basically LCA was looking at one half of the equation, which makes agriculture look  
**[0:08:00-0:08:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:08:00):**  insanely bad and wasn't looking at the sequestration potential.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:08:04):**  Now anecdotally at the time there had been a lot of articles and sort of examples of  
**[0:08:14-0:08:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:08:14):**  farms that were using regenerative grazing practices, things like rotational grazing  
**[0:08:22-0:08:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:08:22):**  using multi-species.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:08:23):**  And anecdotally we're seeing improvements to the health of their soil, to the increase  
**[0:08:30-0:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:08:30):**  in their topsoil and the health of the land.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:08:34):**  And what we wanted to do was to try and see could we capture some of these benefits in  
**[0:08:40-0:08:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:08:40):**  an LCA and how might that change the narrative around what agriculture could look like beyond  
**[0:08:50-0:08:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:08:50):**  just looking at how do we produce food in a way that's as carbon efficient as possible  
**[0:08:56-0:09:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:08:56):**  from an emissions standpoint to looking at if we start to look at the sequestration,  
**[0:09:01-0:09:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:09:01):**  do some of these systems that a lot of people would consider to be inefficient, either inefficient  
**[0:09:08-0:09:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:09:08):**  uses of land or inefficient uses of carbon, would they actually fare better if we started  
**[0:09:14-0:09:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:09:14):**  to quantify the soil carbon sequestration?  
**[0:09:18-0:09:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:09:18):**  So through this work was funded by General Mills.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:09:22):**  At the time they had just acquired the Epic brand which makes like animal protein like  
**[0:09:28-0:09:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:09:28):**  beef jerky type bars.  
**[0:09:32-0:09:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:09:32):**  And they had one farm in their supply chain in particular called White Oak Pastures who  
**[0:09:37-0:09:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:09:37):**  had been basically practicing this regenerative grazing holistic land management for at the  
**[0:09:44-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:09:44):**  time around 20 years.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:09:46):**  And so it kind of provided the perfect opportunity to combine General Mills' desire to better  
**[0:09:54-0:10:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:09:54):**  understand regenerative agriculture, to better quantify their company and their subsidiaries'  
**[0:10:02-0:10:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:10:02):**  carbon emissions in a more holistic way.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:10:05):**  And yeah, that led to this body of work.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:10:10):**  And what shocks me is that on the LCA side or on all of this research is that the potential  
**[0:10:16-0:10:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:10:16):**  or the drawdown potential wasn't really looked at until now.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:10:20):**  Mostly the pollution side of things or the emission equivalent, which is always a tricky  
**[0:10:25-0:10:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:10:25):**  one because we put everything under one number at the end, but we'll talk about that as well.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:10:31):**  So this was and is revolutionary work.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:10:34):**  Has been seen since then because you mentioned this is work you did four years ago or the  
**[0:10:39-0:10:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:10:39):**  research side was four years ago, then of course written, peer reviewed and published,  
**[0:10:44-0:10:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:10:44):**  which means we're four years further down the line.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:10:46):**  But have you seen others like taking that challenge of even I mean, the first challenge  
**[0:10:52-0:10:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:10:52):**  of like trying to quantify the potential of drawdown in soil and biomass or unfortunately  
**[0:10:59-0:11:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:10:59):**  it has been a very, very empty field until now?  
**[0:11:02-0:11:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:11:02):**  Yeah, no, I think at the time, if one was to do a literature review on soil carbon sequestration  
**[0:11:10-0:11:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:11:10):**  in LCA, there was almost nothing that was popping up.  
**[0:11:14-0:11:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:11:14):**  Now we know others were working on this simultaneously, but due to the nature of research and publishing,  
**[0:11:23-0:11:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:11:23):**  we didn't actually see those papers coming out until several years later.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:11:27):**  So I would say since then, a lot of kind of papers and articles have been focused on how  
**[0:11:35-0:11:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:11:35):**  do we start to quantify the drawdown, the soil carbon sequestration.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:11:40):**  And in particular, it's been a pretty hot topic amongst the kind of corporate climate  
**[0:11:48-0:11:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:11:48):**  commitment space.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:11:50):**  The Science Based Targets Initiative back in February just published their draft Forest,  
**[0:11:56-0:12:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:11:56):**  Land and Agriculture Guidance for how companies can set targets related to land and agricultural  
**[0:12:04-0:12:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:12:04):**  based emissions.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:12:05):**  And it now looks like they're moving from a previous state, which was not allowing companies  
**[0:12:11-0:12:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:12:11):**  to account for soil carbon sequestration or for any sort of sequestration towards their  
**[0:12:16-0:12:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:12:16):**  targets to now allowing them to do so.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:12:20):**  And that's really, I think, going to change the way that companies think about the potential  
**[0:12:25-0:12:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:12:25):**  of agriculture exactly to meet their climate targets.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:12:30):**  And so that's on the carbon potential.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:12:34):**  And so just to what were some of the conclusions or what were some of the outcomes you saw  
**[0:12:40-0:12:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:12:40):**  out of that study and body of work?  
**[0:12:41-0:12:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:12:41):**  Because what you did, I think, is look at, of course, a 20 year land, like the pieces  
**[0:12:46-0:12:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:12:46):**  of land and the fields that they've been working on for 20 years.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:12:49):**  And I encourage anybody to go deeper into the work of wider pastures, because it's very,  
**[0:12:54-0:12:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:12:54):**  very interesting, to say the least.  
**[0:12:55-0:13:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:12:55):**  But you also looked at some newly acquired land, degraded land that they bought recently,  
**[0:13:00-0:13:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:13:00):**  maybe five years ago, probably, and what how quickly that started to change.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:13:04):**  And what did you see there in quite an advanced and complex regenerative or farm using regenerative  
**[0:13:12-0:13:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:13:12):**  practices?  
**[0:13:13-0:13:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:13:13):**  How fast were changes that you saw?  
**[0:13:15-0:13:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:13:15):**  And how instrumental was that compared to the total emissions of the farm?  
**[0:13:18-0:13:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:13:18):**  Because obviously, that's what Epic and General Mills wanted to know.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:13:21):**  Like does it stack up?  
**[0:13:22-0:13:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:13:22):**  Is it is it relevant in our in what we emit?  
**[0:13:26-0:13:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:13:26):**  And what is the potential of the sequestration basically?  
**[0:13:30-0:13:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:13:30):**  Yeah, no, that's a great question.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:13:33):**  And maybe that's a good time for me to just kind of explain how the soil sampling worked.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:13:40):**  I'm not a soil scientist, we partnered with a soil scientist to handle all of the the  
**[0:13:46-0:13:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:13:46):**  sampling work.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:13:48):**  So that was one thing that was unique about this study is other in other cases where people  
**[0:13:54-0:13:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:13:54):**  are trying to quantify the soil carbon.  
**[0:13:56-0:14:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:13:56):**  A lot of times they're relying on models where they're collecting data inputs, they're plugging  
**[0:14:01-0:14:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:14:01):**  those inputs into some sort of model.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:14:04):**  That's then, you know, giving an estimate of what the soil carbon potential might be.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:14:10):**  For this study, we really wanted to the results to be as robust as possible.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:14:16):**  So we did opt to take soil samples directly from the farm.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:14:21):**  That comes with its own, you know, set of limitations and uncertainties that are different  
**[0:14:25-0:14:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:14:25):**  from modeling.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:14:26):**  But it does give us a little bit more confidence in the results that we were seeing.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:14:32):**  So there's two main approaches to kind of sampling soil carbon over time and understanding  
**[0:14:40-0:14:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:14:40):**  those changes.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:14:42):**  One is to basically take a sample in one year.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:14:45):**  Wait a few years, take another sample, wait a few years, take another sample.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:14:50):**  Same spot, same depth, same time of year, same day.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:14:54):**  Same everything.  
**[0:14:55-0:14:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:14:55):**  Exactly.  
**[0:14:56-0:14:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:14:56):**  Exactly.  
**[0:14:57-0:14:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:14:57):**  To the extent that that can be controlled.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:14:58):**  If we had wanted to do that with white oak pastures, we would have had to have started  
**[0:15:03-0:15:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:15:03):**  this work 20 years ago.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:15:04):**  So that was not a good option for this study.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:15:07):**  Are there farms that have done that?  
**[0:15:10-0:15:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:15:10):**  Are there farms that have been doing, because that would be an amazing body of data basically.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:15:18):**  Has somebody done that retrospective?  
**[0:15:20-0:15:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:15:20):**  Just making sure we take, as we take a picture every year in some places just to follow or  
**[0:15:25-0:15:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:15:25):**  a shot actually for a video or documentary, like the biggest little farm I think they  
**[0:15:29-0:15:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:15:29):**  did for seven years in certain spots every year, the same shot at the same time, et cetera.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:15:33):**  Have we taken any of those for the soil carbon site or that's been wishful thinking?  
**[0:15:38-0:15:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:15:38):**  Or maybe 20 years ago we weren't so much looking at that.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:15:41):**  I'm pretty sure there are scientists who have looked at that.  
**[0:15:48-0:15:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:15:48):**  But again, soil is so specific to the region, to the thing that scientists are trying to  
**[0:15:53-0:15:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:15:53):**  study, whether it's an ecosystem, whether it's agriculture.  
**[0:15:57-0:16:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:15:57):**  I don't know for sure, but I've definitely seen soil health lectures where they'll show  
**[0:16:05-0:16:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:16:05):**  Gabe Brown's soil carbon data.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:16:09):**  He's one of the kind of US pioneers of Regen AG.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:16:13):**  But I've definitely seen graphs that talk about his soil carbon data all the way back  
**[0:16:19-0:16:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:16:19):**  to 1993.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:16:20):**  I think in Rothamsted actually, yeah, I've seen that as well.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:16:21):**  And I think in Rothamsted in the UK, because for sure we'll get emails now, they have the  
**[0:16:26-0:16:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:16:26):**  largest soil sample library and history book basically where I've been in that library  
**[0:16:33-0:16:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:16:33):**  actually and it's absolutely stacked with soil samples going back, I think 160 years  
**[0:16:39-0:16:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:16:39):**  or something on their research farm.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:16:42):**  So there is something, and then of course you could now take some sampling and run it  
**[0:16:46-0:16:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:16:46):**  through the new sensors and labs we have.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:16:49):**  So there's for sure ways to do it, but I don't think on these active farms, most people didn't  
**[0:16:53-0:16:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:16:53):**  have the time nor the budgets and the research to do that on every field or every piece.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:16:58):**  Okay, so that's one approach which you couldn't do because you couldn't travel back 20 years.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:17:03):**  So what's the other approach that you opted for?  
**[0:17:06-0:17:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:17:06):**  Yeah, so the other approach is called a chronosequence approach.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:17:10):**  And in essence, it's substituting space for time.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:17:16):**  And so the reason that this site was so well suited to a chronosequence approach was because  
**[0:17:23-0:17:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:17:23):**  it had sort of its, when we were doing this study, the total farm acreage was I believe  
**[0:17:29-0:17:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:17:29):**  around 3000 acres.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:17:31):**  However, it had kind of started with a smaller amount of land and almost every year in the  
**[0:17:39-0:17:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:17:39):**  last 20 years had acquired new land.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:17:43):**  So basically what that meant is we had some portions of the farm that had been under that  
**[0:17:49-0:17:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:17:49):**  management practice for 20 years, and we had other portions of the farm that had just gotten  
**[0:17:58-0:17:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:17:58):**  started.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:17:59):**  And so basically, I don't remember the exact years, but we were able to identify using  
**[0:18:07-0:18:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:18:07):**  the kind of soil, there was like a soil database because we wanted to make sure when we were  
**[0:18:12-0:18:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:18:12):**  sampling fields, we were sampling fields that had as similar soil profiles as possible.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:18:19):**  And we were basically able to identify, I think there was a year zero field that they  
**[0:18:23-0:18:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:18:23):**  had just purchased, had not been under any sort of animal influence.  
**[0:18:30-0:18:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:18:30):**  And then I think there was like a three, five, seven, and then like all the way up to 20  
**[0:18:36-0:18:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:18:36):**  year plots.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:18:37):**  Exactly.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:18:38):**  And so using the chronosequence is basically saying, let's pretend like this year zero  
**[0:18:45-0:18:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:18:45):**  field is what the year 20 field started out as.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:18:50):**  And basically then you can see that the year 20 field was storing a lot more carbon than  
**[0:18:57-0:19:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:18:57):**  the year zero field.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:19:00):**  And that sort of assumes, and I know that's not true, that the exact management practices  
**[0:19:05-0:19:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:19:05):**  stay the same.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:19:07):**  How do you work with that as they learned, I think a lot into that past 20 years and  
**[0:19:12-0:19:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:19:12):**  have been adjusting their approach?  
**[0:19:15-0:19:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:19:15):**  How do you adjust in the research basically that it's not every field has had the same  
**[0:19:20-0:19:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:19:20):**  treatment for 20 years or 15 or five or 10?  
**[0:19:23-0:19:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:19:23):**  Yeah.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:19:24):**  And I mean, that's where our goal as kind of the LCA practitioners was to really understand  
**[0:19:32-0:19:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:19:32):**  directionally what is happening and get as close to a magnitude as possible.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:19:41):**  But yeah, if we had been doing this to advance soil science, we might have been a lot more  
**[0:19:47-0:19:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:19:47):**  careful to say, okay, what was the exact management practice on the 20 year field?  
**[0:19:52-0:19:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:19:52):**  How did that differ from the seven year field?  
**[0:19:56-0:19:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:19:56):**  What's different?  
**[0:19:58-0:20:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:19:58):**  But overall, the things we were pretty confident in were that the original land use before  
**[0:20:06-0:20:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:20:06):**  being converted to perennial pasture was pretty consistent.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:20:09):**  So in that region of Georgia, I think it was predominantly being the crop rotation was  
**[0:20:18-0:20:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:20:18):**  something like wheat, peanut, corn and soy that were basically being grown in very chemical  
**[0:20:24-0:20:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:20:24):**  intensive systems.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:20:26):**  A lot of erosion had occurred.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:20:29):**  So you had very, very degraded land that they were starting with.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:20:34):**  And then, yeah, we did see like there was quite a bit of variation in the soil carbon  
**[0:20:43-0:20:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:20:43):**  that was stored in each of the different fields.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:20:46):**  And that's probably reflective of the fact that the management wasn't identical over  
**[0:20:50-0:20:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:20:50):**  the last 20 years.  
**[0:20:53-0:21:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:20:53):**  But what we did see was a very strong directional trend line of the carbon sequestration.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:21:01):**  And basically, that trend line was around five to six times higher than what would be  
**[0:21:07-0:21:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:21:07):**  considered normal for grazing systems in that region of the US.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:21:12):**  Okay, so five to six times higher.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:21:16):**  What does that mean in terms of potential of soil carbon sequestration?  
**[0:21:22-0:21:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:21:22):**  In terms of what's the 5x or 6x here?  
**[0:21:25-0:21:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:21:25):**  Yeah, so they were essentially drying down carbon five to six times faster using their  
**[0:21:31-0:21:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:21:31):**  multi species, you know, rotational.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:21:34):**  Compared to what we know now or compared to what is the standard of perennial grazing  
**[0:21:39-0:21:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:21:39):**  there and that's what we've been using in models as well.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:21:42):**  So there were, does it suggest we're way off in terms of what we expect, what we calculated  
**[0:21:47-0:21:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:21:47):**  until now?  
**[0:21:48-0:21:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:21:48):**  No, so that was compared to what the literature said was likely the potential rate of sequestration.  
**[0:21:55-0:22:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:21:55):**  Of perennial pasture in that region of the US.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:22:01):**  That was likely not integrating multi species and not doing the same adaptive grazing.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:22:10):**  That's a massive difference, like five to six times.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:22:13):**  I mean, it depends what the starting point is, obviously.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:22:17):**  But it's a very big difference.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:22:20):**  And then how did that lead into, because I saw the headlines and infographics of basically  
**[0:22:26-0:22:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:22:26):**  claiming carbon negative beef.  
**[0:22:28-0:22:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:22:28):**  And of course, they compared it to some plant based or let's say non beef burger once, which  
**[0:22:33-0:22:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:22:33):**  did it very well, did very well on the infographics.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:22:36):**  But what was the quote unquote conclusion, because you can never conclude these things,  
**[0:22:40-0:22:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:22:40):**  because then we're going to talk about the limitations and or let's say the possibilities  
**[0:22:44-0:22:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:22:44):**  of further research.  
**[0:22:46-0:22:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:22:46):**  What did that lead to compared to the emission side?  
**[0:22:49-0:22:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:22:49):**  Because of course, that was what you mentioned.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:22:50):**  We want to bring in the potential of sequestration into the normal work of LC-ASIS, which is  
**[0:22:55-0:22:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:22:55):**  looking at the emission side of things.  
**[0:22:57-0:23:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:22:57):**  How did those two stack up, basically?  
**[0:23:00-0:23:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:23:00):**  Yeah, so there were two parts to the study.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:23:05):**  One was that we did look at the entire farm when we were trying to capture the emissions.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:23:12):**  And then because General Mills through Epic was sourcing beef from the farm, they wanted  
**[0:23:17-0:23:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:23:17):**  to understand specifically the footprint of that beef.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:23:20):**  So we looked at the whole farm and then we looked at the beef footprint.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:23:24):**  This is where some of the LCA jargon comes into play.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:23:29):**  But essentially, the way that you understand the beef emissions in the context of an entire  
**[0:23:35-0:23:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:23:35):**  farm.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:23:36):**  And I don't think I mentioned, but at the time, the farm had, they had beef, they had  
**[0:23:43-0:23:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:23:43):**  chicken for meat, they had egg layers.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:23:47):**  They had pork, sheep, goat, duck, guinea fowl.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:23:52):**  So they had quite a few species.  
**[0:23:55-0:24:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:23:55):**  So part of the challenge is untangling from a complex multi-species operation.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:24:04):**  How do we understand what the beef footprint is in the context of that?  
**[0:24:08-0:24:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:24:08):**  And in some ways, that's a bit of an arbitrary exercise.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:24:12):**  We used the best practice in LCA, which is essentially economic allocation.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:24:18):**  And so all of the animals were contributing to the soil carbon sequestration that was  
**[0:24:23-0:24:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:24:23):**  occurring on the farm and to the...  
**[0:24:26-0:24:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:24:26):**  But which one did what is obviously tricky.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:24:29):**  Exactly.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:24:30):**  Which one did what is a tricky question.  
**[0:24:34-0:24:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:24:34):**  So essentially what we did was from the entire farm, we were able to pretty cleanly separate  
**[0:24:41-0:24:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:24:41):**  the beef only emissions because in our models, we were looking at things like, yeah, how  
**[0:24:49-0:24:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:24:49):**  many head of cattle did they have?  
**[0:24:51-0:24:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:24:51):**  What were their age ranges?  
**[0:24:53-0:24:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:24:53):**  What were, how much manure were they producing?  
**[0:24:55-0:24:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:24:55):**  And what did the models say the emissions from that were?  
**[0:24:59-0:25:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:24:59):**  How much feed were they digesting?  
**[0:25:00-0:25:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:25:00):**  And what did the models say were the emissions from that?  
**[0:25:04-0:25:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:25:04):**  These are the same models that predicted the soil carbon potential where we're five to  
**[0:25:09-0:25:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:25:09):**  six times off.  
**[0:25:10-0:25:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:25:10):**  So how do we know, let's say, do we need a lot more research also on that side of things?  
**[0:25:16-0:25:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:25:16):**  Because I think a lot of this data comes from, not from these kinds of systems.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:25:20):**  So how do we...  
**[0:25:21-0:25:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:25:21):**  Let's unpack that later.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:25:23):**  So you were taking this into account now because I'm really wondering and I've seen more and  
**[0:25:29-0:25:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:25:29):**  more, I wouldn't say suggestions, but a lot of this data on the methane side or the emissions  
**[0:25:34-0:25:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:25:34):**  side comes from a CAFA operation.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:25:36):**  So the factory farm side of things, which is a very different kind of approach, let's  
**[0:25:41-0:25:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:25:41):**  say the least if you have been in one compared to something like this.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:25:44):**  And so we might be off by a factor X when we look at emissions and emission equivalent,  
**[0:25:50-0:25:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:25:50):**  which probably makes all these infographics look really odd or weird if you had to go  
**[0:25:55-0:25:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:25:55):**  deeper into that.  
**[0:25:56-0:25:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:25:56):**  So that's a side note.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:25:58):**  But so you looked at all of that and then separate out the beef side because that went  
**[0:26:03-0:26:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:26:03):**  to Epic and that was of course what General Mills was interested in.  
**[0:26:06-0:26:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:26:06):**  And then what was there basically a bit tricky, but still doable conclusion coming out of  
**[0:26:14-0:26:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:26:14):**  that?  
**[0:26:15-0:26:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:26:15):**  Yep.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:26:16):**  So then for the sequestration, we basically had the total sequestration, well, the rate  
**[0:26:21-0:26:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:26:21):**  of sequestration, the annual rate of sequestration for the farm because an LCA typically looks  
**[0:26:27-0:26:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:26:27):**  at a single operating year.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:26:29):**  We then looked at the total sequestration that occurred in that operating year that  
**[0:26:34-0:26:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:26:34):**  we were looking at.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:26:36):**  And then through LCA best practice, we did economic allocation.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:26:40):**  So basically that set that looks at all of the revenue that's being generated on the  
**[0:26:46-0:26:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:26:46):**  farm.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:26:47):**  And then basically, if beef is say generating 50 percent of the revenue, it says 50 percent  
**[0:26:54-0:26:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:26:54):**  of the sequestration can be allocated to beef.  
**[0:26:57-0:27:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:26:57):**  So this isn't a perfect scientific way of doing it.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:27:02):**  But it is the industry best practice for when allocation needs to happen.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:27:08):**  So basically the conclusion was that within our estimates, we do think that the net total  
**[0:27:16-0:27:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:27:16):**  emissions for beef is likely negative.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:27:19):**  We'll probably touch on some of these uncertainties and error bars and things like that.  
**[0:27:23-0:27:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:27:23):**  Yeah, because I saw a huge bar on methane and a very conservative number even on that,  
**[0:27:28-0:27:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:27:28):**  which is very interesting.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:27:30):**  But let's say that if you look at the beef alone within the system, it seems like a carbon  
**[0:27:36-0:27:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:27:36):**  negative, which is a positive thing.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:27:38):**  Let's just be very clear here.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:27:39):**  A carbon negative footprint.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:27:42):**  And then looking at the farm as a whole, it was a different outcome.  
**[0:27:46-0:27:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:27:46):**  It was significantly less carbon, but not a carbon negative conclusion.  
**[0:27:51-0:27:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:27:51):**  Right.  
**[0:27:52-0:27:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:27:52):**  Yeah.  
**[0:27:53-0:27:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:27:53):**  So looking at the whole farm and I had to pull up the PowerPoint to remember this number,  
**[0:27:59-0:28:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:27:59):**  it looked like the soil carbon sequestration in that operating year was offsetting around  
**[0:28:05-0:28:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:28:05):**  85 percent of the total farms emissions for that year.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:28:10):**  Which is massive.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:28:11):**  Just even now we go into the uncertainties there.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:28:14):**  So what would be I think that's a massive conclusion, a massive potential.  
**[0:28:19-0:28:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:28:19):**  Was that a surprise to you?  
**[0:28:21-0:28:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:28:21):**  Did you know some of these?  
**[0:28:23-0:28:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:28:23):**  What was when you first saw these results or when you were making these PowerPoints  
**[0:28:29-0:28:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:28:29):**  to present this as well?  
**[0:28:30-0:28:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:28:30):**  What was the biggest surprise you found in doing this research?  
**[0:28:34-0:28:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:28:34):**  Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't say the results were surprising, but I think what was most exciting  
**[0:28:40-0:28:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:28:40):**  is I was on the farm when the soil samples were being taken.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:28:45):**  And so we're going field to field.  
**[0:28:47-0:28:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:28:47):**  We start with the kind of year zero, you know, the lower year fields and basically the soil  
**[0:28:55-0:28:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:28:55):**  is it's bright red clay down there.  
**[0:28:58-0:29:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:28:58):**  And the year zero field had basically no dark topsoil on it.  
**[0:29:03-0:29:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:29:03):**  It was just basically an all red clay core.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:29:07):**  And we did meter deep cores.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:29:09):**  So this was like a truck going down a whole meter so you could see the, you know, the  
**[0:29:15-0:29:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:29:15):**  different horizons, which was very cool.  
**[0:29:17-0:29:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:29:17):**  By the time we got to the fields that had been under management for several years, all  
**[0:29:22-0:29:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:29:22):**  of a sudden you could visibly see the topsoil layer, the dark, rich, you know, organic matter  
**[0:29:30-0:29:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:29:30):**  topsoil layer on top visibly growing.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:29:34):**  And so, you know, by year 20 you had just a core with a significant, you could visibly  
**[0:29:41-0:29:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:29:41):**  tell with your eyes that the topsoil on this farm was increasing.  
**[0:29:47-0:29:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:29:47):**  And we had somebody, we had Nicole Masters actually, that said you could smell it as  
**[0:29:51-0:29:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:29:51):**  well.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:29:52):**  Like you can, even if we're not trained, like if you're not a farmer, et cetera, you can  
**[0:29:54-0:29:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:29:54):**  smell the difference if your eyes closed between healthy soil and non-healthy soil.  
**[0:29:59-0:30:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:29:59):**  But of course we can see it as well and you saw it.  
**[0:30:03-0:30:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:30:03):**  I believe it.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:30:04):**  And that's the amazing thing about animals on pasture is you can go and enjoy the farm  
**[0:30:08-0:30:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:30:08):**  and not be overwhelmed by the aromas that a lot of people consider to be not very pleasant.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:30:16):**  Our nose is a very strong sensor.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:30:19):**  Yeah.  
**[0:30:20-0:30:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:30:20):**  And good compost, good stuff doesn't smell.  
**[0:30:22-0:30:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:30:22):**  It smells earthy and very, there's something, that's a whole different discussion, but there's  
**[0:30:28-0:30:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:30:28):**  something I think deep in there that suggests something that we generally like this earthy  
**[0:30:32-0:30:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:30:32):**  smell and don't like the smell smell, let's say.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:30:37):**  Exactly.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:30:38):**  But yeah, so what was, there was kind of the waiting period between when we sent the samples  
**[0:30:45-0:30:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:30:45):**  off to the lab and we're kind of waiting to get the, you know, the quantification of carbon  
**[0:30:52-0:30:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:30:52):**  for each sample back.  
**[0:30:54-0:31:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:30:54):**  So it was very, very exciting to see those soil cores and what you could visibly see  
**[0:31:00-0:31:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:31:00):**  as, you know, soil health improving throughout the 20 year chronosequence to finally translate  
**[0:31:08-0:31:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:31:08):**  that into, you know, what we thought was the sequestration rate at the farm and then to  
**[0:31:16-0:31:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:31:16):**  visibly see how that stacked up to what a typical LCA would consider to be the emissions  
**[0:31:23-0:31:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:31:23):**  side of the equation.  
**[0:31:25-0:31:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:31:25):**  So that was very exciting.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:31:28):**  I don't know that I was surprised by the result.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:31:32):**  I guess I was, you know, I think in many of these cases you're sort of fearing the worst.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:31:36):**  You're fearing that you're going to be working on a study.  
**[0:31:41-0:31:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:31:41):**  Beef is already so controversial.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:31:43):**  So you have all of these emissions and you're worried that the sequestration is going to  
**[0:31:46-0:31:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:31:46):**  be meaningless.  
**[0:31:47-0:31:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:31:47):**  And if that's the case, you know, it's really becomes even more difficult to make the case  
**[0:31:53-0:31:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:31:53):**  for regenerative agriculture, for livestock integration, for kind of rebuilding our ecosystems  
**[0:31:59-0:32:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:31:59):**  and reintegrating animals to the land.  
**[0:32:02-0:32:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:32:02):**  But when we see these results, I think it does show some really good promise for what  
**[0:32:10-0:32:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:32:10):**  the potential of using animals to restore degraded land could be from a carbon perspective.  
**[0:32:18-0:32:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:32:18):**  And to unpack another piece of that puzzle before we go to what can be improved or how  
**[0:32:23-0:32:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:32:23):**  can we make these results much more robust, which sounds like we need to revisit the models  
**[0:32:29-0:32:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:32:29):**  on the emission side as well.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:32:30):**  But there's in the paper, the final paper, there is this mention of it.  
**[0:32:35-0:32:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:32:35):**  It all sounds super amazing and very interesting.  
**[0:32:38-0:32:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:32:38):**  Significantly lower emissions are significantly lower total emissions when you count the sequestration,  
**[0:32:45-0:32:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:32:45):**  but it does require twice and a half times the land.  
**[0:32:49-0:32:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:32:49):**  Can we unpack that a bit?  
**[0:32:50-0:32:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:32:50):**  Like what leads to that?  
**[0:32:52-0:32:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:32:52):**  Because it's such a low input way.  
**[0:32:55-0:32:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:32:55):**  It's intensive and extensive at the same time.  
**[0:32:57-0:33:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:32:57):**  How can that lead to two and a half times more land?  
**[0:33:00-0:33:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:33:00):**  Or how is that land calculated, let's say in other systems, which require an enormous  
**[0:33:04-0:33:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:33:04):**  amount of land beyond that to mine the fertilizer, etc.  
**[0:33:08-0:33:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:33:08):**  How does that stack up if we look at the two and a half times?  
**[0:33:11-0:33:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:33:11):**  Should we be really worried?  
**[0:33:12-0:33:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:33:12):**  Can we still feed the world with these things?  
**[0:33:14-0:33:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:33:14):**  I mean, I think many people when they saw it was like, oh, OK, this is going to be an  
**[0:33:17-0:33:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:33:17):**  argument that's going to be used against, let's say, region ag quite strongly.  
**[0:33:23-0:33:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:33:23):**  What is your response to when somebody said, yes, but it uses two and a half times more  
**[0:33:28-0:33:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:33:28):**  land and we can't have that because we have to feed the world?  
**[0:33:31-0:33:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:33:31):**  Yeah.  
**[0:33:32-0:33:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:33:32):**  And I mean, there could be a whole podcast episode on this question itself.  
**[0:33:38-0:33:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:33:38):**  But I think a few thoughts are that, you know, a, this type of system has the opportunity  
**[0:33:44-0:33:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:33:44):**  to use marginal land that would otherwise not be croppable.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:33:50):**  And if you're not able to grow crops on a certain piece of land, that land wouldn't  
**[0:33:55-0:34:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:33:55):**  be able to support, you know, growing animal feed, for example, for confined animals.  
**[0:34:03-0:34:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:34:03):**  In the US, I think the majority of our land is actually kind of pasture and rangeland,  
**[0:34:10-0:34:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:34:10):**  most of which is unsuitable for growing crops.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:34:15):**  So there is there is an opportunity to add a little bit more nuance to the discussion  
**[0:34:20-0:34:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:34:20):**  about where is this appropriate from a land use perspective, where is this maybe not appropriate  
**[0:34:26-0:34:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:34:26):**  from a land use perspective?  
**[0:34:28-0:34:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:34:28):**  But I think that the other sort of thing to unpack is that, I mean, I focus mostly on  
**[0:34:34-0:34:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:34:34):**  the US context, but we have we have quite a bit of cropland that is not actually growing  
**[0:34:43-0:34:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:34:43):**  food for people to eat, to consume directly.  
**[0:34:47-0:34:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:34:47):**  And so, you know, somehow we've gotten to a point where we have somewhere between, you  
**[0:34:52-0:35:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:34:52):**  know, 300 to 400 million acres of cropland in the US and, you know, for scale, a country  
**[0:35:01-0:35:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:35:01):**  like Switzerland is 10 million acres.  
**[0:35:03-0:35:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:35:03):**  So we're we're talking about quite a bit of quite a bit of cropland in the US.  
**[0:35:07-0:35:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:35:07):**  And, you know, somehow 70 percent of that land is basically growing just two crops.  
**[0:35:13-0:35:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:35:13):**  Seven zero, just for this is seven zero, not one seven.  
**[0:35:16-0:35:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:35:16):**  It's massive.  
**[0:35:17-0:35:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:35:17):**  It's seven zero, 70 percent of our US cropland is pretty much growing just two crops.  
**[0:35:26-0:35:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:35:26):**  And a large majority of those two crops are going into livestock feed now because of the  
**[0:35:34-0:35:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:35:34):**  efficiencies that have come with, you know, things like synthetic fertilizer.  
**[0:35:41-0:35:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:35:41):**  We have been able to increase yields of those crops to the point and that along with the,  
**[0:35:49-0:35:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:35:49):**  you know, the animal genetics where now we have animals that, you know, I think a Cornish  
**[0:35:55-0:36:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:35:55):**  cross chicken grows to market weight in six weeks or something like that.  
**[0:36:01-0:36:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:36:01):**  So we have incredibly efficient animal genetics, incredibly efficient, you know, corn and soy  
**[0:36:07-0:36:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:36:07):**  farming that basically combined, you know, when you when you confine all the animals  
**[0:36:14-0:36:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:36:14):**  to a small space gives a very, very small land footprint.  
**[0:36:19-0:36:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:36:19):**  However, that small land footprint is not without consequence.  
**[0:36:24-0:36:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:36:24):**  So for example, we have nitrate pollution pretty much everywhere in the US in the groundwater.  
**[0:36:33-0:36:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:36:33):**  Part of that is from the fertilizer runoff for growing the feed so intensively.  
**[0:36:38-0:36:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:36:38):**  Part of that is from manure runoff from the the livestock, the confined livestock operations.  
**[0:36:46-0:36:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:36:46):**  There are air pollution concerns as well with with confined animals kind of going back to  
**[0:36:52-0:36:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:36:52):**  the aroma that apparently can be smelled for for miles away.  
**[0:36:58-0:37:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:36:58):**  So it's you know, it's one of those things where I think land is worth a much more nuanced  
**[0:37:04-0:37:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:37:04):**  conversation about, you know, what how should we be using our land?  
**[0:37:10-0:37:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:37:10):**  What should we be growing out of our cropland acres in the US?  
**[0:37:14-0:37:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:37:14):**  I think less than one percent is growing, you know, fruits and vegetables and nuts and  
**[0:37:20-0:37:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:37:20):**  things like that.  
**[0:37:22-0:37:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:37:22):**  A lot of it is really going towards growing the animal feed.  
**[0:37:28-0:37:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:37:28):**  So yeah, I think there's more to unpack there than just it uses two and a half times more  
**[0:37:33-0:37:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:37:33):**  land.  
**[0:37:34-0:37:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:37:34):**  Yeah, I think it's there's there's the question which you raised at the beginning.  
**[0:37:37-0:37:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:37:37):**  What kind of what kind of land?  
**[0:37:39-0:37:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:37:39):**  Second, if we take an old land into consideration, plastics and alloties.  
**[0:37:43-0:37:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:37:43):**  OK, that's a whole different discussion.  
**[0:37:45-0:37:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:37:45):**  And also, like, is that land of all the feed and ethanol, which is another huge issue that  
**[0:37:54-0:37:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:37:54):**  the land is there, let's say.  
**[0:37:56-0:37:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:37:56):**  It's just not used to grow food in many cases.  
**[0:37:58-0:38:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:37:58):**  It's used to grow feed or fuel.  
**[0:38:01-0:38:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:38:01):**  And both of that should stop immediately.  
**[0:38:03-0:38:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:38:03):**  And this does seem to suggest that there is especially the multi species and holistic  
**[0:38:09-0:38:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:38:09):**  grazing or adaptive grazing, whatever we want to call it, for sure getting emails about this  
**[0:38:14-0:38:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:38:14):**  as well, but is a very intensive way of producing quite a lot of calories.  
**[0:38:19-0:38:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:38:19):**  Like, did you compare that as well?  
**[0:38:21-0:38:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:38:21):**  Like what this size farm almost per hectare per acre produces compared to the neighbors  
**[0:38:26-0:38:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:38:26):**  in Georgia that are producing maybe the wheat corn rotation that you were mentioning before?  
**[0:38:31-0:38:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:38:31):**  Like compared to the neighbors, the amount of calories that people actually eat and why  
**[0:38:36-0:38:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:38:36):**  to pass is is producing must be completely off the chart compared to neighbors and not  
**[0:38:40-0:38:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:38:40):**  taking in a lot of inputs because they are very input low.  
**[0:38:44-0:38:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:38:44):**  Do they import a lot?  
**[0:38:45-0:38:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:38:45):**  Like, does the system as a farm there for at a farm level need a lot of things coming  
**[0:38:49-0:38:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:38:49):**  into the farm or is it mostly quote unquote self-sufficient?  
**[0:38:53-0:38:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:38:53):**  Like what inputs do they do they bring onto the farm?  
**[0:38:56-0:39:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:38:56):**  What if you which you obviously counted as well into the RCA?  
**[0:39:00-0:39:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:39:00):**  Yeah, so the answer to your first question is we didn't look at like a calorie per calorie  
**[0:39:05-0:39:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:39:05):**  basis.  
**[0:39:06-0:39:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:39:06):**  I think that's also a very nuanced conversation.  
**[0:39:09-0:39:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:39:09):**  And we need to look at the nutrients in the calories.  
**[0:39:13-0:39:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:39:13):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:39:14-0:39:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:39:14):**  But in terms of the inputs for the farm, the the beef, sheep and goats were almost self-sufficient,  
**[0:39:23-0:39:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:39:23):**  like 100 percent grass fed.  
**[0:39:25-0:39:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:39:25):**  They were bringing in some minerals.  
**[0:39:28-0:39:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:39:28):**  So ruminants typically need they had a mobile mineral bar and then, you know, the cows and  
**[0:39:36-0:39:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:39:36):**  the animals know exactly what their body needs.  
**[0:39:38-0:39:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:39:38):**  And so that's a very, very small input.  
**[0:39:41-0:39:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:39:41):**  But otherwise, for the hogs and the poultry, those are monogastrics.  
**[0:39:48-0:39:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:39:48):**  So they can't at least the species that we've bred right now, they can't survive on just  
**[0:39:55-0:39:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:39:55):**  the grass alone.  
**[0:39:57-0:40:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:39:57):**  So they were bringing in feed for those animals.  
**[0:40:02-0:40:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:40:02):**  So grains.  
**[0:40:05-0:40:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:40:05):**  But otherwise, I think those were the major inputs.  
**[0:40:10-0:40:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:40:10):**  You know, there's a little bit of fuel for them running their own for running their their  
**[0:40:17-0:40:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:40:17):**  trucks and being able to get around the 3000 acres.  
**[0:40:21-0:40:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:40:21):**  I have it right here.  
**[0:40:25-0:40:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:40:25):**  Poultry and pig feed, the mineral bar.  
**[0:40:28-0:40:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:40:28):**  Oh, the year kind of zero and one fields.  
**[0:40:32-0:40:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:40:32):**  They were seeding those fields with with grass seed or the mix of their grass seed in the  
**[0:40:40-0:40:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:40:40):**  first few years.  
**[0:40:42-0:40:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:40:42):**  And then once it was seeded, they weren't doing any more of that.  
**[0:40:46-0:40:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:40:46):**  And then it was fuel, electricity and water.  
**[0:40:49-0:40:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:40:49):**  So pretty.  
**[0:40:52-0:40:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:40:52):**  Yeah, the poultry and the pigs are hard because they do they do require the external feed.  
**[0:40:59-0:41:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:40:59):**  But the ruminants were almost self-sufficient.  
**[0:41:03-0:41:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:41:03):**  So would that then suggest if the non-ruminants are first of all needing inputs and maybe  
**[0:41:10-0:41:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:41:10):**  because of that, and we'll get into the models later, but are not the biggest contributor,  
**[0:41:15-0:41:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:41:15):**  let's say to the soil carbon side or to the they are a big contributor to the emission  
**[0:41:20-0:41:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:41:20):**  side, would you then suggest obviously not making farm suggestions to to get rid of that  
**[0:41:25-0:41:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:41:25):**  part of the system and keep the ruminants that clearly can survive on grass itself after  
**[0:41:32-0:41:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:41:32):**  the seeding, obviously, and after transition period?  
**[0:41:34-0:41:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:41:34):**  Or is that just a very simplistic reductionist way of looking at some of this data?  
**[0:41:40-0:41:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:41:40):**  Yeah, no, this is that's an excellent question.  
**[0:41:45-0:41:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:41:45):**  And I think that the important thing to remember is that the LCA is an oversimplified model  
**[0:41:52-0:41:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:41:52):**  of what is happening on the farm.  
**[0:41:55-0:41:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:41:55):**  And in our case, we were looking at a single component, which was the the carbon and the  
**[0:41:59-0:42:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:41:59):**  greenhouse gas emissions coming from the farm.  
**[0:42:04-0:42:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:42:04):**  Whereas when you when you visit the farm, when you hear Will Harris talk about the systems  
**[0:42:12-0:42:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:42:12):**  and the cycles that he's recreating, it becomes very apparent that having the multi species  
**[0:42:17-0:42:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:42:17):**  is a really important part of the operation.  
**[0:42:20-0:42:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:42:20):**  There are still things we're learning about how to best manage for livestock parasites,  
**[0:42:26-0:42:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:42:26):**  which can live in the soil for years and years and years, and actually having multiple species  
**[0:42:34-0:42:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:42:34):**  and especially the chickens help to kind of scratch the chickens, follow the cows, they  
**[0:42:40-0:42:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:42:40):**  kind of help to scratch and incorporate some of the manure.  
**[0:42:43-0:42:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:42:43):**  They eat the fly larvae that is growing in the manure.  
**[0:42:48-0:42:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:42:48):**  So they decrease the fly population, which can be quite a nuisance when you have livestock.  
**[0:42:54-0:42:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:42:54):**  They're getting some additional feed and protein from eating that larvae.  
**[0:42:59-0:43:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:42:59):**  And there's some evidence that having the multi species can help to reduce the parasite  
**[0:43:03-0:43:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:43:03):**  loads as well within the pastures.  
**[0:43:06-0:43:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:43:06):**  So we do know anecdotally and depending on what the field of study is, that there are  
**[0:43:14-0:43:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:43:14):**  innumerable benefits to having multiple species.  
**[0:43:17-0:43:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:43:17):**  That's the other thing is different species eat different grasses that are growing on  
**[0:43:22-0:43:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:43:22):**  the pasture.  
**[0:43:23-0:43:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:43:23):**  So the cows are going to have the things they like.  
**[0:43:25-0:43:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:43:25):**  The goats are going to have the things they like.  
**[0:43:27-0:43:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:43:27):**  The chickens are going to have the things they like.  
**[0:43:30-0:43:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:43:30):**  So you kind of have a more balanced, healthier, more biodiverse pasture as well if you have  
**[0:43:35-0:43:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:43:35):**  the multi species.  
**[0:43:39-0:43:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:43:39):**  The question on feed is that kind of goes down an interesting rabbit hole because what  
**[0:43:44-0:43:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:43:44):**  you're optimizing for determines kind of the approach to the solutions.  
**[0:43:51-0:44:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:43:51):**  So for example, if we're optimizing for the most efficient CO2 equivalent animal protein,  
**[0:44:01-0:44:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:44:01):**  pork and chicken typically end up being much more CO2 equivalent efficient compared to  
**[0:44:10-0:44:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:44:10):**  beef because of the methane emissions.  
**[0:44:13-0:44:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:44:13):**  However, if you were trying to optimize for something like farming that's free of fossil  
**[0:44:18-0:44:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:44:18):**  fuels, all of a sudden the ruminants are probably going to have the biggest potential to achieve  
**[0:44:24-0:44:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:44:24):**  that.  
**[0:44:25-0:44:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:44:25):**  And that's where I think as we're sort of moving towards better understanding the role  
**[0:44:29-0:44:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:44:29):**  that agriculture plays in both climate change but also in the potential to help producers  
**[0:44:35-0:44:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:44:35):**  adapt and potentially mitigate climate change, the conversation is going to evolve as to  
**[0:44:42-0:44:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:44:42):**  how we want to prioritize our different land use, animal protein, what we grow for annual  
**[0:44:50-0:44:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:44:50):**  crops, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:44:52-0:44:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:44:52):**  Yeah, I think that's an excellent point that many people forget.  
**[0:44:58-0:45:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:44:58):**  And so what needs to happen, let's say on the other side of the equation, you mostly  
**[0:45:03-0:45:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:45:03):**  look now at the potential and the sequestration side of the LCA that has been missing until  
**[0:45:09-0:45:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:45:09):**  now and luckily other people are working on that as well.  
**[0:45:11-0:45:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:45:11):**  How do we bring the positive potential to an LCA and to this kind of research?  
**[0:45:17-0:45:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:45:17):**  But then looking at the other side, what we've been mentioning as well is that a lot of these  
**[0:45:21-0:45:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:45:21):**  models on methane, a lot of these models on emissions are models and don't reflect what  
**[0:45:28-0:45:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:45:28):**  has been happening on these kind of pioneering farms.  
**[0:45:31-0:45:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:45:31):**  So do you see that work is needed to make these LCA is more robust also on the, let's  
**[0:45:37-0:45:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:45:37):**  say the emission side?  
**[0:45:38-0:45:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:45:38):**  And if so, what needs to happen there, what would be interesting research projects to  
**[0:45:44-0:45:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:45:44):**  make the emission side more robust as well and not based on potentially outdated, maybe  
**[0:45:48-0:45:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:45:48):**  not, but potentially outdated models?  
**[0:45:50-0:45:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:45:50):**  Yeah, no, this is something I think about a lot in my line of work where there's a saying,  
**[0:45:59-0:46:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:45:59):**  I think it's something like all models are wrong, most are useless.  
**[0:46:04-0:46:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:46:04):**  And I think that applies very much to LCA as well, where the original goal of LCA was  
**[0:46:12-0:46:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:46:12):**  to pretty much help companies understand where the emissions hotspots were over an entire  
**[0:46:19-0:46:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:46:19):**  life cycle.  
**[0:46:22-0:46:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:46:22):**  So the goal was to take a holistic approach to look at all elements of production from,  
**[0:46:28-0:46:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:46:28):**  if we take agriculture as an example, the upstream production of fertilizers, all of  
**[0:46:34-0:46:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:46:34):**  the transportation of those fertilizers to the farm.  
**[0:46:38-0:46:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:46:38):**  When you get to on farm, you're looking at the application of those fertilizers, emissions  
**[0:46:43-0:46:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:46:43):**  associated with that, emissions associated with-  
**[0:46:46-0:46:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:46:46):**  Which are massive on methane and nitrogen and all kinds of other emissions.  
**[0:46:52-0:46:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:46:52):**  Exactly.  
**[0:46:53-0:46:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:46:53):**  It's a hot bat.  
**[0:46:55-0:47:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:46:55):**  Exactly, and then after the farm gate, looking at what's needed to convert, say, wheat into  
**[0:47:01-0:47:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:47:01):**  wheat flour, how much fuel and energy and then how much energy does it take to transport  
**[0:47:07-0:47:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:47:07):**  all that flour to General Mills or whichever company is using it.  
**[0:47:12-0:47:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:47:12):**  So the original goal was to understand the hotspots that were occurring across an entire  
**[0:47:20-0:47:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:47:20):**  sort of life cycle approach.  
**[0:47:23-0:47:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:47:23):**  The challenge is that we're now moving from a point in time in which companies wanted  
**[0:47:28-0:47:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:47:28):**  to understand the hotspots and the areas of opportunity to companies wanting or, I guess,  
**[0:47:34-0:47:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:47:34):**  needing to quantify their emissions in a much more accurate way.  
**[0:47:41-0:47:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:47:41):**  And that's been a really kind of difficult thing because pretty much all of the databases  
**[0:47:48-0:47:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:47:48):**  that we rely on to do our LCA assessments, they're based on generic data.  
**[0:47:54-0:47:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:47:54):**  And a lot of times it's looking at data at, say, the country level.  
**[0:47:59-0:48:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:47:59):**  So for example, it might have a data set that's wheat grown in the US, but there's not a data  
**[0:48:05-0:48:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:48:05):**  set that's wheat grown using regenerative practices or wheat grown using irrigation  
**[0:48:11-0:48:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:48:11):**  or wheat grown in Georgia versus Kansas.  
**[0:48:14-0:48:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:48:14):**  So the LCA's that we have been relying on, they give us essentially an estimate, but  
**[0:48:23-0:48:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:48:23):**  not a very accurate picture of what would actually be reflected on a specific farm or  
**[0:48:31-0:48:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:48:31):**  a specific operation.  
**[0:48:33-0:48:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:48:33):**  And I think this is where a lot of the tension is, is that because of that, we have a lot  
**[0:48:39-0:48:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:48:39):**  of groups that are focused right now on improving the accounting and improving the methodology  
**[0:48:45-0:48:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:48:45):**  development, basically to try and make the numbers more accurate to kind of reduce the  
**[0:48:52-0:48:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:48:52):**  uncertainty and the error bars that are associated with those LCA's.  
**[0:48:58-0:49:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:48:58):**  But I think what's interesting here is that we're sort of at a stage where because we've  
**[0:49:04-0:49:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:49:04):**  had so much LCA work done on different food and ag products in different countries, we're  
**[0:49:11-0:49:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:49:11):**  at a stage where we really know what drives farm level emissions.  
**[0:49:17-0:49:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:49:17):**  And from a soil health perspective, we're learning new things every day, but we also  
**[0:49:22-0:49:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:49:22):**  have a general idea of what practices are going to lead to improved soil health.  
**[0:49:28-0:49:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:49:28):**  But the challenge that I see in my industry is I think we're getting very caught up in  
**[0:49:32-0:49:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:49:32):**  trying to figure out how to quantify those emissions better, as opposed to focusing on  
**[0:49:38-0:49:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:49:38):**  how do we make the changes that we know that we need to see.  
**[0:49:43-0:49:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:49:43):**  So an example is that our nitrogen cycle right now is completely out of whack.  
**[0:49:49-0:49:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:49:49):**  And ideally, we would focus on figuring out how do we get those nutrient management plans  
**[0:49:54-0:50:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:49:54):**  in place so that we don't have nitrates building up in our groundwater and in our surface water.  
**[0:50:01-0:50:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:50:01):**  We also know from a climate change perspective that we need to figure out how to eliminate  
**[0:50:06-0:50:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:50:06):**  the fossil carbon from agriculture.  
**[0:50:09-0:50:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:50:09):**  That's both for the on-farm fuel in tractors and equipment, but also for the production  
**[0:50:16-0:50:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:50:16):**  of say synthetic nitrogen fertilizer.  
**[0:50:19-0:50:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:50:19):**  So there are things that we know we could focus on that would help agriculture align  
**[0:50:25-0:50:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:50:25):**  to what is needed to be aligned with the 1.5 degree future, and yet there's a lot of time  
**[0:50:33-0:50:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:50:33):**  and energy going into arguing about methodological improvements and especially things like the  
**[0:50:41-0:50:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:50:41):**  permanence of soil carbon, which is a pretty interesting topic.  
**[0:50:48-0:50:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:50:48):**  So what would you tell, let's say we're in a theater, I always like to use this example  
**[0:50:53-0:50:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:50:53):**  because I hope we imagine listening to this wherever you are listening, could be on a  
**[0:50:58-0:51:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:50:58):**  tractor, on a horse, on the land, it could be somewhere in a commute, et cetera.  
**[0:51:02-0:51:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:51:02):**  But imagine we're in a nice old theater and we're on stage and we're doing this in person  
**[0:51:07-0:51:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:51:07):**  and the room is full of investors or people working in finance.  
**[0:51:12-0:51:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:51:12):**  What would you tell them, obviously without giving investment advice, but to focus on  
**[0:51:17-0:51:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:51:17):**  in this field of work when they walk out of that theater in the evening and say, okay,  
**[0:51:23-0:51:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:51:23):**  tomorrow morning I'm going to dig deeper into XYZ.  
**[0:51:27-0:51:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:51:27):**  What would you tell them?  
**[0:51:28-0:51:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:51:28):**  What are interesting places to start digging deeper and to understand more of this potential,  
**[0:51:35-0:51:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:51:35):**  but also the challenges and opportunities of let's say the LCA work or the measurement  
**[0:51:40-0:51:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:51:40):**  and trying to quantify these things?  
**[0:51:43-0:51:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:51:43):**  Which direction would you give them?  
**[0:51:44-0:51:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:51:44):**  Oh, I have so many thoughts.  
**[0:51:48-0:51:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:51:48):**  But maybe I'll start with what I think investors really should be or anyone working in the  
**[0:51:53-0:51:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:51:53):**  space should really be cautious about.  
**[0:51:56-0:52:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:51:56):**  And I think that's being really cautious about carbon as a topic and in particular soil carbon  
**[0:52:05-0:52:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:52:05):**  sequestration.  
**[0:52:07-0:52:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:52:07):**  I think in many ways what's happening with soil carbon sequestration and the associated  
**[0:52:13-0:52:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:52:13):**  work to develop carbon models and accounting is really taking a reductionist view of something  
**[0:52:21-0:52:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:52:21):**  that is actually part of a much more complex carbon cycle.  
**[0:52:26-0:52:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:52:26):**  For example, there's the temporal element.  
**[0:52:29-0:52:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:52:29):**  In order to be able to account for soil carbon sequestration, we have to pick an arbitrary  
**[0:52:34-0:52:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:52:34):**  point in time as a baseline state.  
**[0:52:38-0:52:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:52:38):**  Now that baseline state is usually representing a very recent state rather than a historic  
**[0:52:45-0:52:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:52:45):**  state.  
**[0:52:46-0:52:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:52:46):**  So basically when we restore soil health and sequester carbon, a lot of times it's happening  
**[0:52:51-0:52:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:52:51):**  on degraded lands, at least in the US.  
**[0:52:54-0:53:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:52:54):**  So essentially what we're doing is we're putting the carbon back that was lost from that land  
**[0:53:00-0:53:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:53:00):**  over the last several decades of soil degrading agricultural practices.  
**[0:53:06-0:53:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:53:06):**  So setting a baseline of degraded lands where you then have a huge potential to put back  
**[0:53:11-0:53:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:53:11):**  the soil carbon and then trying to sell that carbon as, say, offsets for companies to continue  
**[0:53:19-0:53:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:53:19):**  emitting I would say is it's a little bit questionable and it's definitely not aligned  
**[0:53:25-0:53:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:53:25):**  with what's needed to achieve a 1.5C future.  
**[0:53:29-0:53:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:53:29):**  And I think the other really interesting element is that when we try and account for soil carbon  
**[0:53:35-0:53:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:53:35):**  sequestration, we're basically limiting soil carbon sequestration to a mere subtraction  
**[0:53:40-0:53:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:53:40):**  of carbon from the atmosphere.  
**[0:53:43-0:53:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:53:43):**  And we're kind of ignoring the whole complex carbon cycle that's associated with that.  
**[0:53:48-0:53:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:53:48):**  So in a healthy carbon cycle, the goal is not to lock up that carbon permanently and  
**[0:53:54-0:53:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:53:54):**  store it in the ground, which I think has largely been the focus of, say, soil carbon  
**[0:53:59-0:54:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:53:59):**  markets.  
**[0:54:00-0:54:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:54:00):**  But it's really to put that carbon to work as the lifeblood of our ecosystems.  
**[0:54:06-0:54:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:54:06):**  And so I think ruminants are a really good example where you have grass that's pulling  
**[0:54:10-0:54:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:54:10):**  carbon down from the atmosphere as it grows.  
**[0:54:13-0:54:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:54:13):**  Ruminants can consume this grass.  
**[0:54:16-0:54:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:54:16):**  In turn, that tells the grass to keep growing, keep sending those sugars down to their roots.  
**[0:54:24-0:54:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:54:24):**  And in the process, the animals depositing manure, which is helping to feed the soil  
**[0:54:28-0:54:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:54:28):**  microbes, it's helping to put carbon in the soil as well.  
**[0:54:33-0:54:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:54:33):**  And humans can't digest that grass.  
**[0:54:37-0:54:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:54:37):**  Ruminants can because they have those special microbes in their rumen.  
**[0:54:42-0:54:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:54:42):**  And there is an associated release of methane from that.  
**[0:54:46-0:54:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:54:46):**  But methane is a short-lived climate pollutant.  
**[0:54:50-0:54:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:54:50):**  So basically it stays in the atmosphere for around 12 years before it then breaks down  
**[0:54:56-0:55:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:54:56):**  back into CO2 and H2O, which again are the building blocks for more grass.  
**[0:55:02-0:55:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:55:02):**  And so the cycle then begins again.  
**[0:55:05-0:55:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:55:05):**  And I think there's really a danger in separating all of those pieces out because then you get  
**[0:55:12-0:55:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:55:12):**  the kind of conventional thinking of methane is bad, soil carbon is good, which leads to  
**[0:55:19-0:55:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:55:19):**  people trying to figure out ways of minimizing methane and maximizing soil carbon sequestration.  
**[0:55:25-0:55:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:55:25):**  But oftentimes with solutions that continue to perpetuate distancing animals from the  
**[0:55:32-0:55:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:55:32):**  land.  
**[0:55:33-0:55:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:55:33):**  And so I think really smart investors and people working in this space should realize  
**[0:55:40-0:55:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:55:40):**  that our goal should be to better understand what is a healthy carbon cycle, where are  
**[0:55:47-0:55:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:55:47):**  our carbon cycles currently broken, and how can we restore the balance of carbon going  
**[0:55:53-0:56:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:55:53):**  into the atmosphere and carbon coming back out in a way where it's constantly flowing  
**[0:56:01-0:56:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:56:01):**  through the food system.  
**[0:56:03-0:56:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:56:03):**  So that's kind of the way that I like to think about this space is how do we really move  
**[0:56:08-0:56:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:56:08):**  from soil carbon sequestration being just a single piece of the puzzle, one half of  
**[0:56:14-0:56:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:56:14):**  the equation, to how do we invest in restoring and rebalancing broken cycles, which are going  
**[0:56:23-0:56:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:56:23):**  to be much more long term, deeply rooted solutions to I think many of our agricultural problems  
**[0:56:29-0:56:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:56:29):**  right now.  
**[0:56:30-0:56:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:56:30):**  So what would you do if you would be in charge of a large investment fund or a large investment  
**[0:56:36-0:56:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:56:36):**  portfolio, let's say a billion dollars?  
**[0:56:40-0:56:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:56:40):**  What would you focus on in terms of investments?  
**[0:56:44-0:56:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:56:44):**  How would you put, how and where would you put money to work if tomorrow morning you  
**[0:56:48-0:56:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:56:48):**  would be in charge of a considerable sum of money with complete freedom of how to put  
**[0:56:53-0:56:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:56:53):**  that to work?  
**[0:56:55-0:57:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:56:55):**  Obviously as in that or not obviously as investments, but the time horizon could be 20, 30, 50 or  
**[0:57:00-0:57:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:57:00):**  200 years.  
**[0:57:01-0:57:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:57:01):**  What would you focus on?  
**[0:57:04-0:57:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:57:04):**  Where would you where would you start?  
**[0:57:05-0:57:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:57:05):**  What would you prioritize if you had, I wouldn't say unlimited, but almost unlimited resources?  
**[0:57:10-0:57:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:57:10):**  Yeah, I mean, for me personally, as someone who works at the intersection of kind of climate  
**[0:57:17-0:57:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:57:17):**  change and agriculture, what I would invest in is really fossil free farming, investing  
**[0:57:23-0:57:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:57:23):**  in ideas and creative solutions that basically get the fossil fuels that are embedded in  
**[0:57:31-0:57:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:57:31):**  our conventional agricultural system completely phased out ideally by 2050 at the latest,  
**[0:57:39-0:57:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:57:39):**  ideally sooner.  
**[0:57:41-0:57:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:57:41):**  But ultimately, for agriculture to be aligned with the 1.5C future, we basically have to  
**[0:57:49-0:57:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:57:49):**  find ways to phase out all of the embedded fossil fuels.  
**[0:57:52-0:57:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:57:52):**  I think I mentioned a lot of this is in the synthetic fertilizer production.  
**[0:57:57-0:58:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:57:57):**  A lot of this is in the on farm tractor fuel and energy.  
**[0:58:02-0:58:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:58:02):**  There's quite a bit in transport as well.  
**[0:58:06-0:58:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:58:06):**  And most people don't realize that the carbon footprint of row crops, at least in the US,  
**[0:58:11-0:58:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:58:11):**  is typically more than 50 percent from fossil fuels.  
**[0:58:17-0:58:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:58:17):**  And so that comes mostly.  
**[0:58:19-0:58:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:58:19):**  I mean, is that then is there an 80 20 there as well as like is it the mostly fertilizer  
**[0:58:23-0:58:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:58:23):**  or mostly tractors?  
**[0:58:24-0:58:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:58:24):**  It's pretty much 50 50.  
**[0:58:27-0:58:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:58:27):**  Wow.  
**[0:58:28-0:58:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:58:28):**  Fifty fifty.  
**[0:58:29-0:58:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:58:29):**  Electric tractors make sense and focusing on all the bio fertilizers, stimulants and  
**[0:58:35-0:58:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:58:35):**  everything and how to produce massive amounts of high quality compost, et cetera, should  
**[0:58:39-0:58:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:58:39):**  get equal attention in your in your fund.  
**[0:58:43-0:58:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:58:43):**  Exactly, exactly.  
**[0:58:45-0:58:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:58:45):**  And I think what's happening right now is, you know, soil carbon, soil carbon sequestration.  
**[0:58:50-0:58:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:58:50):**  It's having its day in the sun right now.  
**[0:58:53-0:59:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:58:53):**  But when we think about specifically the climate ROI, finding ways to invest in phasing out  
**[0:59:00-0:59:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:59:00):**  the fossil carbon of agriculture is going to have a much higher climate return on investment  
**[0:59:06-0:59:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:59:06):**  than storing carbon in the soil.  
**[0:59:09-0:59:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:59:09):**  There are definitely benefits to increasing soil carbon stocks.  
**[0:59:13-0:59:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:59:13):**  We absolutely should be doing that.  
**[0:59:16-0:59:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:59:16):**  But really, when we're thinking about this, you know, Paris Agreement, this global goal  
**[0:59:20-0:59:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:59:20):**  of trying to limit warming to one point five C, then we need fossil fuels to be phased  
**[0:59:25-0:59:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:59:25):**  out and soil carbon to be sequestered.  
**[0:59:28-0:59:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:59:28):**  But they're not interchangeable.  
**[0:59:30-0:59:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:59:30):**  So we can't just use soil carbon to offset our agricultural fossil carbon emissions.  
**[0:59:38-0:59:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:59:38):**  And I think that's where that's where I see a big opportunity, because right now, the  
**[0:59:44-0:59:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:59:44):**  way that LCA is are presented, they combine all of the different agricultural greenhouse  
**[0:59:50-0:59:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:59:50):**  gases into that single metric of CO2 equivalents.  
**[0:59:54-0:59:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:59:54):**  But if we start dividing out the sources,  
**[0:59:57-1:00:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=0:59:57):**  Now we get to a whole different podcast, but yeah, I'm absolutely listening because this  
**[1:00:00-1:00:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:00:00):**  is fascinating.  
**[1:00:01-1:00:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:00:01):**  No, no, it's I think it's one of those huge issues.  
**[1:00:04-1:00:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:00:04):**  We put everything on their equivalent and they're not equivalent.  
**[1:00:07-1:00:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:00:07):**  Like methane is 12 years and is a building block for other stuff.  
**[1:00:10-1:00:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:00:10):**  Exactly.  
**[1:00:11-1:00:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:00:11):**  So when we start splitting that, like what would it look like?  
**[1:00:15-1:00:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:00:15):**  And what would you focus on then?  
**[1:00:17-1:00:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:00:17):**  Yeah, so when we start splitting it, that's when we realize just how significant the fossil  
**[1:00:22-1:00:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:00:22):**  carbon portion of the emissions are to agriculture.  
**[1:00:28-1:00:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:00:28):**  But also, you know, one of the really key elements is that, you know, methane and nitrous  
**[1:00:35-1:00:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:00:35):**  oxide, they are biogenic emissions.  
**[1:00:39-1:00:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:00:39):**  They're emissions that are an inherent part of our ecosystems.  
**[1:00:43-1:00:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:00:43):**  You know, even if we didn't have any humans living on Earth, we would still have methane  
**[1:00:47-1:00:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:00:47):**  emissions.  
**[1:00:48-1:00:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:00:48):**  We would still have N2O emissions.  
**[1:00:51-1:00:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:00:51):**  Whereas, so there's the biogenic carbon cycle, there's the fossil carbon cycle, and they  
**[1:00:56-1:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:00:56):**  need to be treated differently.  
**[1:00:58-1:01:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:00:58):**  And that's because, you know, as we think about what's needed to achieve a 1.5 degree  
**[1:01:04-1:01:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:01:04):**  future, we still need deep reductions in methane and N2O.  
**[1:01:10-1:01:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:01:10):**  But the goal is not to fully eliminate methane and N2O.  
**[1:01:14-1:01:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:01:14):**  The goal is to make sure that...  
**[1:01:16-1:01:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:01:16):**  Stop burning dinosaur bones.  
**[1:01:17-1:01:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:01:17):**  Yeah, that's the...  
**[1:01:19-1:01:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:01:19):**  Exactly.  
**[1:01:20-1:01:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:01:20):**  Exactly.  
**[1:01:21-1:01:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:01:21):**  So that's why it's really important that they're treated differently.  
**[1:01:24-1:01:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:01:24):**  And you know, why there's sort of a danger to the oversimplification of LCA's in the  
**[1:01:31-1:01:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:01:31):**  agricultural space using CO2 equivalent.  
**[1:01:35-1:01:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:01:35):**  And the analogy that I like to use is, you know, if you went to your doctor and you said,  
**[1:01:40-1:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:01:40):**  I need help making sure that I have a healthy balanced diet.  
**[1:01:45-1:01:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:01:45):**  If your doctor basically told you just count the number of calories that you're eating,  
**[1:01:49-1:01:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:01:49):**  you would probably be a little bit skeptical because you'd probably dive deeper and say,  
**[1:01:53-1:01:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:01:53):**  well, how much protein should I be eating?  
**[1:01:55-1:01:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:01:55):**  How much fat should I be eating?  
**[1:01:57-1:01:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:01:57):**  How much carbohydrate should I be eating?  
**[1:01:59-1:02:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:01:59):**  And if all they say is calories, then you would probably try and find another doctor.  
**[1:02:05-1:02:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:02:05):**  And I think it's similar for LCA and agriculture and climate change where the predominant way  
**[1:02:11-1:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:02:11):**  we've been thinking about things is sort of CO2 equivalent as basically the calorie metric,  
**[1:02:17-1:02:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:02:17):**  where it combines everything into one metric that looks clean, I guess, on a nutrition  
**[1:02:23-1:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:02:23):**  label.  
**[1:02:25-1:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:02:25):**  But if you dig a little bit deeper, you realize that we have different targets for methane.  
**[1:02:30-1:02:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:02:30):**  We have different targets for nitrous oxide, and we have different targets for fossil carbon.  
**[1:02:35-1:02:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:02:35):**  And if we want a healthy balanced carbon cycle, a healthy balanced nitrogen cycle, and ultimately,  
**[1:02:42-1:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:02:42):**  you know, a climate that's not unsafe for a lot of our populations, we need to start  
**[1:02:50-1:02:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:02:50):**  digging deeper and tracking progress towards those individual targets and start to move  
**[1:02:54-1:03:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:02:54):**  away from the oversimplified CO2 equivalent metric.  
**[1:03:01-1:03:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:03:01):**  And would that be, this is a perfect bridge to the magic wand question I like to ask,  
**[1:03:05-1:03:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:03:05):**  if you can change one thing in agriculture and food or in LCA in general or in the sustainability  
**[1:03:10-1:03:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:03:10):**  space or regenerative space, so you're no longer in charge of your fund, but if you  
**[1:03:16-1:03:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:03:16):**  would be able to change one thing overnight, what would that be?  
**[1:03:20-1:03:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:03:20):**  Yeah, I thought a lot about this question because there are quite a few areas that would  
**[1:03:26-1:03:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:03:26):**  be interesting to see change in.  
**[1:03:28-1:03:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:03:28):**  But I think what I came up with is that if I could change just one thing, it would be  
**[1:03:34-1:03:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:03:34):**  a collective societal agreement that we will no longer tolerate agricultural pollution.  
**[1:03:40-1:03:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:03:40):**  So at least, you know, in the US context, all across the US, we have groundwater that's  
**[1:03:46-1:03:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:03:46):**  polluted with nitrates.  
**[1:03:48-1:03:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:03:48):**  That's not only a health hazard for people, but it's also quite costly.  
**[1:03:53-1:03:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:03:53):**  The water treatment plants to remove these nitrates could run a small rural town of 700  
**[1:03:59-1:04:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:03:59):**  people, something like $2.4 million to install.  
**[1:04:05-1:04:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:04:05):**  And we have dead zones.  
**[1:04:06-1:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:04:06):**  Let's say it's cheaper to pay farmers to change practices, I think.  
**[1:04:10-1:04:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:04:10):**  It would be much cheaper to do some preventative.  
**[1:04:15-1:04:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:04:15):**  Like usually, also in health care, that's the same.  
**[1:04:17-1:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:04:17):**  It's funny how that works.  
**[1:04:18-1:04:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:04:18):**  It's funny how that works.  
**[1:04:19-1:04:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:04:19):**  Yeah, I read an article recently that said, you know, even if every farmer in the US stopped  
**[1:04:24-1:04:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:04:24):**  fertilizing tomorrow, it could take decades for the nitrates that are already in our US  
**[1:04:30-1:04:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:04:30):**  groundwater to actually dissipate.  
**[1:04:32-1:04:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:04:32):**  So that's groundwater.  
**[1:04:34-1:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:04:34):**  We have dead zones in the Gulf of Mexico, in the Chesapeake Bay.  
**[1:04:39-1:04:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:04:39):**  It's really wreaking havoc on our ecosystems.  
**[1:04:41-1:04:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:04:41):**  And it's very disappointing when water is unsafe to swim or to fish from due to agricultural  
**[1:04:49-1:04:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:04:49):**  pollution.  
**[1:04:50-1:04:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:04:50):**  So I think we're kind of at a stage where, in many cases, the pollution that is directly  
**[1:04:57-1:05:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:04:57):**  tied to agriculture is it's incompatible with having life and thriving ecosystems and thriving  
**[1:05:08-1:05:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:05:08):**  communities.  
**[1:05:10-1:05:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:05:10):**  And I think if we were at a point where if we could collectively agree as a society that  
**[1:05:15-1:05:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:05:15):**  we were no longer willing to tolerate those nitrates in our groundwater, to tolerate having  
**[1:05:20-1:05:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:05:20):**  dead zones, unsafe drinking water, unsafe fishing and recreational water, I think that  
**[1:05:25-1:05:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:05:25):**  would go a long way towards changing the agricultural landscape, how we manage our land, what we  
**[1:05:32-1:05:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:05:32):**  grow, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[1:05:36-1:05:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:05:36):**  And as a final question, I mean, you mentioned a few things, but maybe there's something  
**[1:05:41-1:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:05:41):**  that really stands out.  
**[1:05:43-1:05:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:05:43):**  What do you believe to be true about regenerative agriculture that others don't?  
**[1:05:47-1:05:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:05:47):**  This is definitely inspired by a question that Jon Kempf always asks or usually asks.  
**[1:05:50-1:05:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:05:50):**  I listened recently to see if he still asks this.  
**[1:05:53-1:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:05:53):**  But what do you believe to be true?  
**[1:05:54-1:05:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:05:54):**  Where are you contrarian?  
**[1:05:55-1:06:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:05:55):**  Yeah, I mean, it's always hard to know who's thinking what in this space because it's so  
**[1:06:04-1:06:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:06:04):**  big.  
**[1:06:05-1:06:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:06:05):**  In my opinion, I think we're really only scratching the surface of what regenerative agriculture  
**[1:06:11-1:06:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:06:11):**  could be.  
**[1:06:12-1:06:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:06:12):**  Now, this is speaking from someone who's coming at this from the corporate regenerative agriculture  
**[1:06:17-1:06:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:06:17):**  side of things.  
**[1:06:18-1:06:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:06:18):**  And I think a big part of this is to do with potentially confusing what is a basic best  
**[1:06:24-1:06:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:06:24):**  practice for managing soil health and agricultural pollution, such as erosion and runoff, with  
**[1:06:31-1:06:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:06:31):**  regenerative practices.  
**[1:06:33-1:06:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:06:33):**  So, I've seen proposals for regenerative agriculture pilot projects, corporate funded pilot projects  
**[1:06:42-1:06:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:06:42):**  that focus solely on, say, a single practice like cover cropping, and that's called regenerative  
**[1:06:47-1:06:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:06:47):**  agriculture.  
**[1:06:48-1:06:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:06:48):**  Now, I'm pretty sure the NRCS in the US has been trying to promote cover cropping for  
**[1:06:53-1:07:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:06:53):**  the last 50 years as just a basic best practice for soil health.  
**[1:07:00-1:07:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:07:00):**  Another example is that livestock integration gets talked about a lot as a basic principle  
**[1:07:06-1:07:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:07:06):**  of regenerative agriculture.  
**[1:07:09-1:07:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:07:09):**  And yet, most of the corporate pilots related to regenerative agriculture are focused on  
**[1:07:16-1:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:07:16):**  growing feed regeneratively while still keeping those animals distanced from the land.  
**[1:07:21-1:07:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:07:21):**  Which I think that's a really-  
**[1:07:23-1:07:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:07:23):**  Sort of cutting your off from all the potential that we just discussed for the last hour plus.  
**[1:07:28-1:07:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:07:28):**  Yeah.  
**[1:07:29-1:07:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:07:29):**  Exactly.  
**[1:07:30-1:07:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:07:30):**  And that begs quite an interesting question that I think is being danced around right  
**[1:07:34-1:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:07:34):**  now in the RegenAg space, which is around what is the role of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer  
**[1:07:40-1:07:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:07:40):**  in regenerative agriculture?  
**[1:07:43-1:07:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:07:43):**  Because RegenAg, most people are talking about it in terms of farming in harmony with nature.  
**[1:07:49-1:07:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:07:49):**  We do have several early adopter pioneer examples.  
**[1:07:53-1:07:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:07:53):**  I think Gabe Brown said he hasn't been using synthetic nitrogen fertilizer for almost two  
**[1:07:57-1:08:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:07:57):**  decades now.  
**[1:08:00-1:08:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:08:00):**  And that's through animal integration and very careful rebalancing of the carbon and  
**[1:08:06-1:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:08:06):**  nitrogen cycles and the soil biology within his operations.  
**[1:08:11-1:08:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:08:11):**  But I have yet to see a corporate funded regenerative agriculture pilot with a stated goal of either  
**[1:08:17-1:08:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:08:17):**  deeply reducing or eliminating synthetic nitrogen fertilizer.  
**[1:08:23-1:08:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:08:23):**  And then I think one last thought I had on this question is that our food system as a  
**[1:08:29-1:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:08:29):**  whole really has quite a few large cracks.  
**[1:08:34-1:08:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:08:34):**  So for example, when you go to, at least in the US, if you go to the supermarket in the  
**[1:08:38-1:08:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:08:38):**  middle of winter and pick up one pound of tomatoes, you can think about the fact that  
**[1:08:45-1:08:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:08:45):**  the farm worker was likely paid on the order of a single penny to pick that pound of tomatoes.  
**[1:08:54-1:08:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:08:54):**  And I think regenerative agriculture could give us an opportunity to start to address  
**[1:08:59-1:09:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:08:59):**  some of these cracks.  
**[1:09:00-1:09:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:09:00):**  But in order to do that, we have to really acknowledge that they're there.  
**[1:09:04-1:09:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:09:04):**  And I think the current RegenAg landscape is sort of dancing around the cracks or the  
**[1:09:09-1:09:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:09:09):**  fissures in our food system and just trying to come up with solutions that take our existing  
**[1:09:15-1:09:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:09:15):**  system and turn it regenerative.  
**[1:09:19-1:09:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:09:19):**  But I think what's cool is in Japan, they have a term called kintsugi, which is basically  
**[1:09:26-1:09:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:09:26):**  where they repair cracked pottery with gold.  
**[1:09:29-1:09:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:09:29):**  And then I think that piece becomes even more valuable.  
**[1:09:32-1:09:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:09:32):**  The cracked piece becomes even more valuable.  
**[1:09:35-1:09:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:09:35):**  And I see an opportunity to do that here with regenerative agriculture where we can start  
**[1:09:41-1:09:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:09:41):**  a somewhat uncomfortable dialogue that acknowledges where some of these, and brings to light where  
**[1:09:47-1:09:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:09:47):**  some of these cracks are so that we can find collaborative ways of sealing them back up  
**[1:09:55-1:10:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:09:55):**  in a way that really brings kind of long-term deep-rooted solutions as opposed to potentially  
**[1:10:04-1:10:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:10:04):**  more shallow-rooted, not holistic solutions to a lot of the problems that we face in our  
**[1:10:13-1:10:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:10:13):**  agriculture and food systems.  
**[1:10:16-1:10:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:10:16):**  I think it's a perfect end and a perfect metaphor.  
**[1:10:18-1:10:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:10:18):**  I mean, there are very uncomfortable cracks in this agriculture system and we need to  
**[1:10:23-1:10:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:10:23):**  have a deep look at how we got to such an extractive system in many places, not just  
**[1:10:28-1:10:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:10:28):**  a few decades, but a few millennia.  
**[1:10:30-1:10:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:10:30):**  And I just finished a book.  
**[1:10:32-1:10:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:10:32):**  It should be on the podcast soon, hopefully, Healing Grounds of Liz Carlyle, her latest  
**[1:10:37-1:10:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:10:37):**  book, which I'll put in links below as well in the show notes.  
**[1:10:40-1:10:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:10:40):**  And we really have to face the social side, but also the land ownership side, the non-diversity  
**[1:10:45-1:10:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:10:45):**  side, globally, the indigenous side, the access to food side.  
**[1:10:49-1:10:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:10:49):**  I mean, there are many uncomfortable, but I think absolutely essential cracks to talk  
**[1:10:56-1:11:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:10:56):**  about because otherwise, as I think it was Lauren Tucker saying of Renourish Studio,  
**[1:11:02-1:11:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:11:02):**  if we keep talking about soil health and focus everything on soil health, that's what we're  
**[1:11:06-1:11:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:11:06):**  going to get, healthier soil and not fix any of the other things that we very uncomfortably  
**[1:11:11-1:11:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:11:11):**  got ourselves into.  
**[1:11:12-1:11:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:11:12):**  I'm not blaming anybody.  
**[1:11:13-1:11:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:11:13):**  We all did this.  
**[1:11:14-1:11:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:11:14):**  We're part of this.  
**[1:11:16-1:11:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:11:16):**  But it is definitely a system that needs a bit more than a few cover crops here and there  
**[1:11:20-1:11:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:11:20):**  and a few extra animals on the land and a bit of compost, and then we'll all be fine.  
**[1:11:25-1:11:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:11:25):**  This is a much deeper and it does a much longer transition that we need to be ready to get  
**[1:11:31-1:11:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:11:31):**  uncomfortable.  
**[1:11:32-1:11:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:11:32):**  I agree.  
**[1:11:33-1:11:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:11:33):**  I agree.  
**[1:11:34-1:11:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:11:34):**  And so I want to thank you for that.  
**[1:11:36-1:11:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:11:36):**  We can go in 10 other directions for another hour, but I want to be conscious of your time  
**[1:11:40-1:11:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:11:40):**  and of the listeners.  
**[1:11:41-1:11:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:11:41):**  But this means we need to have you back at some point.  
**[1:11:44-1:11:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:11:44):**  And thank you so much for the work you do for explaining the magical, interesting, challenging

**[1:12:32-1:12:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:12:32):**  Dear friends of the podcast, I'm super excited to share with you the online video course  
**[1:12:47-1:12:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:12:47):**  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[1:12:52-1:12:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:12:52):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  
**[1:12:56-1:12:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:12:56):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[1:12:57-1:13:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:12:57):**  After 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question how to put money  
**[1:13:02-1:13:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:13:02):**  to work in regenerating soils and have been following this space since 2011 and recording  
**[1:13:06-1:13:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:13:06):**  this podcast since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  
**[1:13:11-1:13:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:13:11):**  What have we seen in this space over the last years?  
**[1:13:13-1:13:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:13:13):**  How have we built our decision making framework?  
**[1:13:16-1:13:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:13:16):**  What to focus on with the podcast?  
**[1:13:18-1:13:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:13:18):**  How have we picked interviewees?  
**[1:13:21-1:13:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:13:21):**  What questions should you ask?  
**[1:13:22-1:13:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:13:22):**  What is happening in this space?

**[1:14:06-1:14:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:14:06):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.

**[1:14:28-1:14:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:14:28):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  
**[1:14:34-1:14:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:14:34):**  so you don't have to ride along.  
**[1:14:36-1:14:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:14:36):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[1:14:41-1:14:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:14:41):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[1:14:47-1:14:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:14:47):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[1:14:51-1:14:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:14:51):**  if you're a soil builder.  
**[1:14:53-1:14:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:14:53):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[1:14:58-1:15:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:14:58):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[1:15:02-1:15:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:15:02):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[1:15:06-1:15:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:15:06):**  So what is it not?  
**[1:15:07-1:15:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:15:07):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[1:15:09-1:15:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:15:09):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[1:15:12-1:15:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:15:12):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[1:15:15-1:15:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:15:15):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[1:15:17-1:15:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:15:17):**  Before making any investment please find professional investment advice.  
**[1:15:23-1:15:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/mariko-thorbecke#t=1:15:23):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking, click on

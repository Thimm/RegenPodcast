**[0:00:18-0:00:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:00:18):**  agroforestry system?  
**[0:00:20-0:00:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:00:20):**  Diversified farms are amazing, but how do we sell all of that if you're not going to  
**[0:00:24-0:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:00:24):**  a small local farmers market?

**[0:00:37-0:00:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:00:37):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture.  
**[0:00:41-0:00:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:00:41):**  Investing as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:43-0:00:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:00:43):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:47-0:00:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:00:47):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:00:52-0:00:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:00:52):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:57-0:00:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:00:57):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:59-0:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:00:59):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:03-0:01:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:01:03):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:01:05):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:10-0:01:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:01:10):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:01:14):**  In March last year, we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support

**[0:01:40-0:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:01:40):**  So welcome to another episode today with the co-founder of Crowd Container.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:01:45):**  Welcome Tobias.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:01:46):**  Hi Koen.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:01:47):**  Thank you so much for having me.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:01:48):**  Great to be here.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:01:49):**  To start with the personal question I always love to ask, how did you end up working on  
**[0:01:54-0:01:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:01:54):**  soil?  
**[0:01:55-0:01:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:01:55):**  Because if I'm not mistaken, you weren't born on a farm.  
**[0:01:58-0:01:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:01:58):**  Yeah, that's right.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:01:59):**  I was born in a small farmer village at the time.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:02:02):**  It was still pretty much a farmer village.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:02:04):**  Now it's changing.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:02:06):**  I've always been interested in food, but I really started thinking more about soil when  
**[0:02:13-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:02:13):**  I like at the beginning of the last decade, when I was working in wholesale trade, selling  
**[0:02:19-0:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:02:19):**  a lot of certified product or organic certified, fair trade certified, all kinds of certification.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:02:26):**  And I realized that people who are really working with the soil, who are on their farms,  
**[0:02:32-0:02:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:02:32):**  having very diversified production system that care for the soil, they have a huge structural  
**[0:02:38-0:02:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:02:38):**  disadvantage in selling their produce.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:02:41):**  And when I realized that, I thought that's really something, something is going wrong  
**[0:02:45-0:02:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:02:45):**  there and I started also thinking what can be done about it.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:02:51):**  What is that structural disadvantage?  
**[0:02:53-0:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:02:53):**  I mean, I can come up with a few, like you're probably producing different kinds of products  
**[0:02:58-0:03:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:02:58):**  and the quantities are smaller or you put in a lot of effort and maybe extra costs.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:03:03):**  What is the main structural disadvantage that puts you against the system as we now know  
**[0:03:08-0:03:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:03:08):**  it, the anonymized commodity system we've built over the last year?  
**[0:03:12-0:03:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:03:12):**  Yeah, sure.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:03:13):**  So basically what happens is that you have this retail system with big supermarket retailers,  
**[0:03:20-0:03:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:03:20):**  where we, most of us buy our food.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:03:23):**  And what you find on the supermarket shelf, as you said, is anonymized commodities, basically  
**[0:03:29-0:03:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:03:29):**  food that has a certain shape, a very clearly predefined shape, and that the supermarket  
**[0:03:38-0:03:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:03:38):**  makes sure that he has never an empty shelf space because he can source that same type  
**[0:03:44-0:03:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:03:44):**  of food from many different places.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:03:47):**  Now what happens if you diversify your production system and you start growing different varieties,  
**[0:03:54-0:03:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:03:54):**  different kinds of crops, you get, as you said, smaller quantities, but you also get  
**[0:03:59-0:04:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:03:59):**  a different kind of food with different qualities that is often higher quality food, but you  
**[0:04:05-0:04:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:04:05):**  don't fit that small shelf space anymore.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:04:09):**  So that's the biggest problem that I experienced in many different ways with many different  
**[0:04:14-0:04:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:04:14):**  products by trying to sell to supermarkets that in the end, it would not exactly match  
**[0:04:20-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:04:20):**  that specification of the commodity.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:04:23):**  So let's say it seems to be that the supermarket or the supermarket shelf is the issue, then  
**[0:04:30-0:04:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:04:30):**  what is the solution or what is a solution that you've of course been working on and  
**[0:04:34-0:04:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:04:34):**  experimenting with because you've done a lot of pilots?  
**[0:04:37-0:04:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:04:37):**  What was the first solution you tried that maybe didn't work or did work?  
**[0:04:40-0:04:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:04:40):**  I don't know what was the first pilot like, but what was the first version or the first  
**[0:04:44-0:04:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:04:44):**  attempt of CrowdContainer?  
**[0:04:46-0:04:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:04:46):**  Well when I was still working in wholesale straight, of course, I did also many trials  
**[0:04:51-0:04:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:04:51):**  and trying to work in very close partnership with supermarkets, trying to find my own shelf  
**[0:04:57-0:05:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:04:57):**  space, nothing really worked out.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:05:00):**  And so I thought in the end I have to get direct access to the end consumer because  
**[0:05:06-0:05:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:05:06):**  just looking at myself, I formed this hypothesis that really tasty pepper for instance that  
**[0:05:15-0:05:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:05:15):**  doesn't have really the right size to enter the supermarket shelf, that that could be  
**[0:05:20-0:05:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:05:20):**  something that could also be interesting for other end consumers and that they also might  
**[0:05:25-0:05:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:05:25):**  appreciate the whole story of how this pepper is grown, why the variety is different, why  
**[0:05:31-0:05:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:05:31):**  it tastes different, why it looks different, that that might be something that is attractive  
**[0:05:36-0:05:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:05:36):**  for the end consumer but not really attractive for a supermarket buying commodities.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:05:42):**  And that's where actually the idea of CrowdContainer was born, that's also where the name is coming  
**[0:05:47-0:05:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:05:47):**  from, that the first pilot we did was just to put online a box full of spices and cashew  
**[0:05:57-0:06:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:05:57):**  nuts and coconut from some mixed crop agroforestry farms in the south of India in Kerala and  
**[0:06:07-0:06:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:06:07):**  we were proposing this to people via a crowdfunding platform here in Switzerland and just seeing  
**[0:06:12-0:06:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:06:12):**  whether there is a demand for it.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:06:14):**  And you picked very deliberately a mixed forest or mixed agroforestry systems or different  
**[0:06:19-0:06:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:06:19):**  products, you weren't selling just the coconut oil or just the coconut or just the spices  
**[0:06:24-0:06:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:06:24):**  and were you already explaining that story like look if you want more trees to be in  
**[0:06:30-0:06:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:06:30):**  agriculture systems, it's called agroforestry and that means they're going to be different  
**[0:06:34-0:06:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:06:34):**  trees together because we don't want a monoculture there which means we need different spices  
**[0:06:38-0:06:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:06:38):**  etc or we're just selling like these are very high-end, very tasty spices and some other  
**[0:06:43-0:06:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:06:43):**  things together like this is a nice box to have or what was the storytelling there when  
**[0:06:48-0:06:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:06:48):**  you did the crowdfunding?  
**[0:06:49-0:06:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:06:49):**  Yeah of course we deliberately picked really that whole, the big variety that you have  
**[0:06:54-0:06:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:06:54):**  on that field, we cannot do everything because some produce is being consumed locally which  
**[0:06:59-0:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:06:59):**  is also very nice but everything that can basically be exported non-perishables, we  
**[0:07:05-0:07:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:07:05):**  put it in that box and we really positioned it in a way to say this is what that forest  
**[0:07:12-0:07:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:07:12):**  can give you instead of just cashew nuts.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:07:15):**  And how was the response?  
**[0:07:16-0:07:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:07:16):**  How did people respond to cashew plus a lot more?  
**[0:07:20-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:07:20):**  Yeah we were quite surprised like in the beginning it was a bit like the beginning of the crowdfunding  
**[0:07:26-0:07:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:07:26):**  was according to our expectations, we were on track, everything fine but not really you  
**[0:07:33-0:07:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:07:33):**  know nothing crazy and then there was some sort of a turning point where the media came  
**[0:07:39-0:07:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:07:39):**  in where some people like influencers picked up that story and said oh but that's amazing,  
**[0:07:45-0:07:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:07:45):**  that is really true that is coming from one hectare of land all these different products  
**[0:07:49-0:07:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:07:49):**  so amazing and then the media came in and bigger media came in and we were completely  
**[0:07:55-0:08:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:07:55):**  like overrun by these orders or actually crowdfunding contributions which we had to compensate with  
**[0:08:03-0:08:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:08:03):**  this mixed box full of stuff.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:08:05):**  How many boxes did you pre-sell basically?  
**[0:08:09-0:08:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:08:09):**  Yeah it was at that time it was something more than 500 but it was big boxes, it was  
**[0:08:15-0:08:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:08:15):**  each box 150 euro.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:08:20):**  And so you felt there was something, something was there, people didn't only want a box for  
**[0:08:25-0:08:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:08:25):**  a good value but they were also interested in that one hectare or one piece of an agroforestry  
**[0:08:30-0:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:08:30):**  system can get all of this like something was clicking there with the media and influencers  
**[0:08:34-0:08:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:08:34):**  etc.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:08:35):**  So what was, apart from shipping all these boxes, what was the next step?  
**[0:08:38-0:08:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:08:38):**  Yeah I mean the first thing as you said, shipping the boxes for me was a big thing because I  
**[0:08:43-0:08:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:08:43):**  always I just traded big like standard containers filled with one product and so when it turned  
**[0:08:52-0:08:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:08:52):**  you know from kind of asking people to support your crowdfunding to you know so the demand  
**[0:08:59-0:09:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:08:59):**  is just coming in and the crowdfunding is ending and people are still asking whether  
**[0:09:03-0:09:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:09:03):**  they can still get one of these boxes and we had to say no now it's closed and you know  
**[0:09:09-0:09:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:09:09):**  we were like who now we have to bring that stuff to Switzerland and will it pass customs,  
**[0:09:17-0:09:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:09:17):**  will it comply with all the regulations, all that stuff because it's not the standardized  
**[0:09:23-0:09:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:09:23):**  food that you usually find and import.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:09:27):**  So the first or the next step was really to make sure that everything is in line with  
**[0:09:34-0:09:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:09:34):**  regulation that customs are sorted out and actually it was easier than I expected.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:09:40):**  I thought that now you know probably the big problems start but then I realized again that  
**[0:09:48-0:09:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:09:48):**  a lot of you know the requirements that I had with buyers this 12 page specification  
**[0:09:55-0:10:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:09:55):**  sheet a lot of that was actually you know the I don't know the packaging size or a machine  
**[0:10:01-0:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:10:01):**  of the supermarket that needed that specification and not really legal requirements.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:10:07):**  So we imported that container, we made a big party when it arrived and had the four or  
**[0:10:12-0:10:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:10:12):**  five hundred people come there and pick up their boxes.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:10:16):**  Yeah has been quite amazing.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:10:18):**  And the boxes were already packed in with the farmer co-op in India or you were packing  
**[0:10:23-0:10:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:10:23):**  it when the container opened in Zurich?  
**[0:10:27-0:10:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:10:27):**  No at the time it was packed at origin at source.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:10:31):**  Which saved a lot of time probably on your end.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:10:33):**  Yeah which otherwise this arrival party wouldn't have been possible.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:10:37):**  Would have been a packing party.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:10:38):**  Yeah I mean today we don't have to do arrival parties anymore and many people ask for it  
**[0:10:44-0:10:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:10:44):**  because it's still in their mind as this crowd container experience and it's for that reason  
**[0:10:51-0:10:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:10:51):**  we can't do it we have to do picking here in Switzerland.  
**[0:10:54-0:10:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:10:54):**  And so then five hundred people and more because maybe many took it together with friends etc.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:10:59):**  were super happy and you could go back to your normal day job but you didn't.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:11:04):**  What was the next step?  
**[0:11:05-0:11:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:11:05):**  Yeah many people challenged me then I said look this can work and people said no come  
**[0:11:10-0:11:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:11:10):**  on Tobias this is only because you have been there in India and you know these guys and  
**[0:11:15-0:11:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:11:15):**  it's your relation to them and it's that's a really special case I don't think that exists  
**[0:11:20-0:11:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:11:20):**  anywhere else and that somehow for me it really motivated me to figure out whether this is  
**[0:11:27-0:11:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:11:27):**  now really a special story with this agroforestry in Kerala and my relation to that or whether  
**[0:11:34-0:11:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:11:34):**  it is something that really yeah whether it's really that structural as I imagined it to  
**[0:11:40-0:11:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:11:40):**  be.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:11:41):**  So we did another four crowd fundings with different origins different countries we imported  
**[0:11:47-0:11:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:11:47):**  coffee from agroforestry coffee from Peru we imported some stuff from Italy we started  
**[0:11:53-0:12:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:11:53):**  working with some Swiss farmers and each time that proved true that basically yeah people  
**[0:12:00-0:12:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:12:00):**  are interested in that type of product and that we can also deliver it.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:12:05):**  And so there was really one off like you were selling a box of coffee plus other things  
**[0:12:10-0:12:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:12:10):**  I'm imagining and turning that from a let's say a crowdfunding machine or a crowdfunding  
**[0:12:16-0:12:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:12:16):**  campaign machine into a company I can imagine is quite a step what was the turning point  
**[0:12:21-0:12:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:12:21):**  there is that after four because you could have gone on not do number five and six and  
**[0:12:25-0:12:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:12:25):**  seven and what was the moment you said okay we need to turn this into something more than  
**[0:12:29-0:12:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:12:29):**  just opening parties for containers and into something more structured.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:12:33):**  Yeah there were several constraints in that model no one very you know from the customer  
**[0:12:40-0:12:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:12:40):**  side it was clear that once you have one of those boxes with all that stuff inside that  
**[0:12:46-0:12:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:12:46):**  you soon might need more pepper but not more cloth for instance and that you don't want  
**[0:12:53-0:12:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:12:53):**  to order another box but on a crowdfunding page you cannot really implement the real  
**[0:12:58-0:13:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:12:58):**  web shop where you can choose what you want to have and that made that it was hard you  
**[0:13:05-0:13:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:13:05):**  know it was easy to convince new people but it was hard for the really convinced customers  
**[0:13:10-0:13:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:13:10):**  to reorder which of course was something we had to fix also because we always wanted to  
**[0:13:17-0:13:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:13:17):**  work in very close partnerships with the farmers and not kind of jump from one sourcing partner  
**[0:13:24-0:13:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:13:24):**  to the next one because that wouldn't help them in the way they produce.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:13:28):**  Then also we had a little bit of legal constraints in terms of we started this with an association  
**[0:13:34-0:13:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:13:34):**  and the association made quite a big turnover with its crowdfunding so of course authorities  
**[0:13:41-0:13:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:13:41):**  started also asking some questions what it really is so we...  
**[0:13:45-0:13:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:13:45):**  What are you actually importing?  
**[0:13:46-0:13:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:13:46):**  Yeah what we do as an association here how commercial it is also in terms of you have  
**[0:13:53-0:13:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:13:53):**  to register with food authorities and all that stuff so it became pretty clear that  
**[0:13:58-0:14:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:13:58):**  we have to incorporate by 2017 second half of 2017 it became very clear that we have  
**[0:14:07-0:14:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:14:07):**  to incorporate and for me it was clear at that point that we want to do the two steps  
**[0:14:13-0:14:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:14:13):**  together we want to incorporate and then build our own platform to run this properly and  
**[0:14:19-0:14:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:14:19):**  also in a way that people can really become regular customers.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:14:23):**  And there I wouldn't say you become an online supermarket but you're going in the direction  
**[0:14:27-0:14:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:14:27):**  of unbundling again the bundle you've built for that one piece of forest or one piece  
**[0:14:34-0:14:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:14:34):**  of the farm.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:14:35):**  So what was the first products you put on or how did that transition from the campaigning  
**[0:14:41-0:14:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:14:41):**  every couple of months in another box to you can actually order individual things or you  
**[0:14:45-0:14:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:14:45):**  can how did you unbundle that how did people respond because they were used to this campaigning  
**[0:14:49-0:14:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:14:49):**  piece as well I'm imagining.  
**[0:14:51-0:14:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:14:51):**  Yeah so I always had this idea in my mind and it's still somehow there when I developed  
**[0:14:57-0:15:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:14:57):**  this idea of crowd containers when I was still working with wholesale straight that somehow  
**[0:15:02-0:15:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:15:02):**  you know this once you accelerate this campaigning and then accelerated more and more it's somehow  
**[0:15:09-0:15:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:15:09):**  slowly the difference between normal shopping and campaign shopping kind of or pre-ordering  
**[0:15:16-0:15:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:15:16):**  will get blurred more and more and it can become more and more convenient for end consumers  
**[0:15:22-0:15:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:15:22):**  to take part in campaigns or sales campaigns without even feeling that it is really a sales  
**[0:15:27-0:15:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:15:27):**  campaign because it starts overlapping and you have a bigger number of people so you  
**[0:15:32-0:15:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:15:32):**  have a bigger spread of you know what kind of products are ordered and so we did just  
**[0:15:39-0:15:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:15:39):**  the first step in that direction by first of all as you said unbundling the box and  
**[0:15:46-0:15:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:15:46):**  just offering the same products separately and see what the demand for the individual  
**[0:15:52-0:15:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:15:52):**  products was but still of course by putting it online in one shop from one region all  
**[0:15:59-0:16:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:15:59):**  these products giving that context that they grow all together and asking people to buy  
**[0:16:05-0:16:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:16:05):**  a box which is customized for their needs still we sold a lot of each product.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:16:12):**  And so what is now we're in 2021 what has crowd container morphed into what is it currently  
**[0:16:19-0:16:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:16:19):**  if I would go to the website I definitely put the link below it is in German so you  
**[0:16:23-0:16:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:16:23):**  will need Google translate if you don't speak German but you get you will get a good idea  
**[0:16:27-0:16:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:16:27):**  what is it currently offering and then we'll get to talk about the future obviously.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:16:31):**  So currently you find offerings from five different origins one is Switzerland we work  
**[0:16:38-0:16:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:16:38):**  with around 20 farms here in Switzerland then Sicily where we work with two pharma cooperatives  
**[0:16:46-0:16:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:16:46):**  there is this product from India we were talking about there is still the coffee from Peru  
**[0:16:53-0:17:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:16:53):**  and there is a newly also some products from Spain and you would have regular crowd ordering  
**[0:17:00-0:17:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:17:00):**  so it's still based on this idea that we collect orders it's pre-sold basically and we import  
**[0:17:07-0:17:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:17:07):**  and send you whatever has been ordered what you find on the website for each product is  
**[0:17:14-0:17:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:17:14):**  a very big amount of transparency information including cost transparency because you pre-order  
**[0:17:20-0:17:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:17:20):**  it you get really that right to a full transparency because no one is speculating with that food  
**[0:17:26-0:17:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:17:26):**  in between the producers and us so you get the price plate who gets what for each product.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:17:33):**  And then it arrives on my doorstep or there's still some kind of party when I can go and  
**[0:17:37-0:17:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:17:37):**  pick it up or both because it's mostly Zurich it's a number of cities in Switzerland let's  
**[0:17:42-0:17:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:17:42):**  just be very clear and how does it work to end up being on my plate.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:17:47):**  So we operate in the whole of Switzerland you can order food from anywhere the non-perishable  
**[0:17:55-0:18:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:17:55):**  products are delivered in a box from the Swiss Postal Service they have a very nice yellow  
**[0:18:01-0:18:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:18:01):**  box which they take back which is circular system and we choose that because it's the  
**[0:18:06-0:18:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:18:06):**  most sustainable delivery option at the moment and you can do this from anywhere in Switzerland  
**[0:18:12-0:18:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:18:12):**  the fresh products they have currently a separate logistics and you have to pick it up we partner  
**[0:18:19-0:18:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:18:19):**  with another shop and they have shops in each like bigger cities there are no real big cities  
**[0:18:26-0:18:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:18:26):**  here in Switzerland but in each bigger city you have a pickup point where you can pick  
**[0:18:31-0:18:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:18:31):**  up for instance fresh mangoes from Spain.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:18:33):**  Wow yeah so it's a mix of fruit that mangoes and of course the coffee and I'm imagining  
**[0:18:38-0:18:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:18:38):**  all the tomato like products and the nuts etc from Sicily the whole cashew nut and all  
**[0:18:45-0:18:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:18:45):**  the spices from India so you get pretty far I mean not all your daily stuff but quite  
**[0:18:49-0:18:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:18:49):**  a nice variety of things you would anyway buy in the supermarket without any price transparency  
**[0:18:54-0:18:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:18:54):**  and obviously completely different quality and in terms of prices both for the customers  
**[0:18:59-0:19:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:18:59):**  for the end consumers and for the farmers what are the big differences there compared  
**[0:19:04-0:19:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:19:04):**  to buying in the supermarket like am I spending twice as much or compared to organic where  
**[0:19:09-0:19:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:19:09):**  am I more or less depends obviously on the product in terms of pricing and then what  
**[0:19:14-0:19:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:19:14):**  does it mean for the farmers to sell with you?  
**[0:19:16-0:19:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:19:16):**  Yeah on the farmer side we have tried to calculate it to compare it to commodity prices which  
**[0:19:21-0:19:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:19:21):**  is of course you know comparing Apple and Pears but still we did it and on an average  
**[0:19:28-0:19:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:19:28):**  we pay 2.7 times the commodity price to farmers.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:19:32):**  For the consumer this means it can vary quite a lot depending on the product it's very hard  
**[0:19:40-0:19:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:19:40):**  to compare to what you get in the supermarket but if you get similar products at some small  
**[0:19:47-0:19:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:19:47):**  shops that is possible no or also on a farmers market you can find sometimes similar products  
**[0:19:54-0:19:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:19:54):**  in the small shop they cost you more than if you buy it from us.  
**[0:19:57-0:20:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:19:57):**  So if you go for the higher end fair trade specialist small shops in the larger cities  
**[0:20:04-0:20:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:20:04):**  you would pay more.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:20:05):**  Or like gourmet shop whatever yeah.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:20:07):**  And in this case it even gets even on your doorstep which helps obviously.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:20:11):**  So that's currently you have how many customers or regular customers do you have interacting  
**[0:20:17-0:20:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:20:17):**  with the platform of course some order large quantities some order maybe less but as it  
**[0:20:21-0:20:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:20:21):**  is a crowd place I mean it gets bundled but just to give a sense of scale how many people  
**[0:20:26-0:20:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:20:26):**  are interacting on the Swiss side of things as a customer.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:20:29):**  Yeah currently we are at almost 10,000 paying customers.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:20:34):**  Which is a lot.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:20:35):**  And of course there is a lot of variation in that group like you know you have maybe  
**[0:20:43-0:20:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:20:43):**  20% of them really regular customers ordering every month or even several times per month  
**[0:20:50-0:20:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:20:50):**  and then you have people who are one offs and you have also a lot of people because  
**[0:20:56-0:21:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:20:56):**  fortunately I can tell that we are growing quite fast at the moment so that also gives  
**[0:21:02-0:21:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:21:02):**  you a lot of people who have just managed to buy the first time and we don't know yet  
**[0:21:07-0:21:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:21:07):**  how whether they will develop into a regular customer or whether they will.  
**[0:21:11-0:21:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:21:11):**  They are a recent cohort yeah.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:21:14):**  And what does because you have a very specific I mean we've known each other for a bit very  
**[0:21:19-0:21:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:21:19):**  specific view on what the role of crowd container will be or could be in the future for regenerative  
**[0:21:25-0:21:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:21:25):**  agriculture can you let us have a look into the future whether you want crowd container  
**[0:21:31-0:21:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:21:31):**  evolve into or what would you like it to be in let's say a couple of years could be much  
**[0:21:36-0:21:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:21:36):**  longer but not next month but in an ideal world what would quite container do for both  
**[0:21:40-0:21:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:21:40):**  the customers and obviously for the farm and the farmers to co-produce etc.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:21:46):**  Yeah I mean from what I experienced we are really still committed and have that vision  
**[0:21:51-0:22:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:21:51):**  of creating a distribution model that is tailored to the needs of really diversified regenerative  
**[0:22:00-0:22:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:22:00):**  agriculture which I think is very much needed to make regenerative agriculture a business  
**[0:22:07-0:22:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:22:07):**  model for the farmers as well a real business case and to bring in young people into farming  
**[0:22:15-0:22:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:22:15):**  make it interesting for them and then also to attract investment I think there is still  
**[0:22:20-0:22:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:22:20):**  a lot to be done also in terms of technology adapt technology for the farms in a way that  
**[0:22:27-0:22:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:22:27):**  it can really be used in this kind of mixed crop set up there's still a long way to go  
**[0:22:32-0:22:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:22:32):**  and I think in our view really that distribution piece has to be put in place to make that  
**[0:22:39-0:22:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:22:39):**  transition work because of course now there is a lot of things going on on the farms but  
**[0:22:46-0:22:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:22:46):**  I hear again and again that many times even though you know you can increase your yields  
**[0:22:52-0:22:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:22:52):**  you can increase the quality you grow but that doesn't always mean that you can easily  
**[0:22:57-0:22:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:22:57):**  sell your stuff.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:22:58):**  Yeah I think it's a point we need to talk more on this podcast and hopefully we will  
**[0:23:03-0:23:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:23:03):**  over the next months and years like how do we actually sell it makes things coming from  
**[0:23:09-0:23:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:23:09):**  forestry systems agroforestry systems but also arable it's not going to be pretty sure  
**[0:23:14-0:23:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:23:14):**  it's not going to be monocultures which means we need ways to sell cover crops that might  
**[0:23:18-0:23:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:23:18):**  be super an amazing ingredient in something and we need that layer on top of the farm  
**[0:23:23-0:23:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:23:23):**  or beyond the farm gate that is able to sell to distribute to reach the end consumer with  
**[0:23:29-0:23:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:23:29):**  the right Facebook ad to use the right storytelling to which is not the job of the farmer some  
**[0:23:35-0:23:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:23:35):**  are amazing at it but it's I mean they have a lot to figure out on the farm and we need  
**[0:23:40-0:23:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:23:40):**  the disruptors I wouldn't say in the supermarket but figure out a way to get these these very  
**[0:23:46-0:23:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:23:46):**  diverse which is very difficult I mean logistic wise mixing mangoes and coffee is as you know  
**[0:23:51-0:23:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:23:51):**  much better than I do very complex so do you really see that digital layer that layer of  
**[0:23:56-0:24:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:23:56):**  connecting there the city obviously as with the countryside and explaining the diversity  
**[0:24:01-0:24:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:24:01):**  is that enough or does it really need to go to a next level with the pickup points and  
**[0:24:06-0:24:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:24:06):**  the shipping and make it as convenient as possible what you're feeling there how far  
**[0:24:11-0:24:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:24:11):**  do we need to go to make it as convenient as walking into a supermarket at 530 or 630  
**[0:24:16-0:24:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:24:16):**  and take something from the shelf yeah I think we have to work on both ends on one side you  
**[0:24:22-0:24:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:24:22):**  have really the operational side where we have also learned in the last three or five  
**[0:24:28-0:24:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:24:28):**  years of prototyping that you know a certain kind of convenience will be required and we  
**[0:24:36-0:24:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:24:36):**  think we know how to work on it we already started to work now with the demand forecasting  
**[0:24:42-0:24:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:24:42):**  and we will slowly slowly replace this crowd ordering model by more forecast model which  
**[0:24:49-0:24:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:24:49):**  is of course feasible only if you have quite a large number of customers but we are closely  
**[0:24:55-0:25:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:24:55):**  getting to a what do you mean by a forecasting model what would that mean in practice that  
**[0:25:00-0:25:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:25:00):**  would mean in practice for instance right now where we have already started is that  
**[0:25:05-0:25:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:25:05):**  we have a shipment from Sicily every month and until last year we always waited for the  
**[0:25:12-0:25:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:25:12):**  order to be sent for the like we did the sales campaign finish the sales campaign sent the  
**[0:25:19-0:25:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:25:19):**  order and now we can already send the order we can already anticipate what will be sold  
**[0:25:24-0:25:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:25:24):**  like at the beginning of the campaign in the future even more in the future we will be  
**[0:25:30-0:25:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:25:30):**  able to send the order before the stuff is sold and still be reasonably sure that 98%  
**[0:25:38-0:25:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:25:38):**  is actually really will be sold like this and then comes this combination of mango and  
**[0:25:44-0:25:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:25:44):**  coffee no because at that point we will be able to have some olive oil with us that we  
**[0:25:50-0:25:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:25:50):**  know that we are going to sell it in the next month and we can ship it together with the  
**[0:25:54-0:26:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:25:54):**  fresh mango when the mango is ripe so that's a piece of convenience that we will slowly  
**[0:26:00-0:26:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:26:00):**  add like we did the unbundling of the boxes and we can do it by building up that really  
**[0:26:07-0:26:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:26:07):**  large number of end customers who are regularly ordering from us and you take on then of course  
**[0:26:15-0:26:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:26:15):**  a bit of the risk of storing potentially quite a few mangoes or quite a few olive oil bottles  
**[0:26:21-0:26:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:26:21):**  that you might not sell you know you will probably so that gets I mean that will be  
**[0:26:25-0:26:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:26:25):**  interesting but of course that also means it's much faster so I still taking part of  
**[0:26:29-0:26:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:26:29):**  a crowd campaign but if I order and it closes like it might already be in Switzerland so  
**[0:26:34-0:26:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:26:34):**  it can be delivered much faster than now when I maybe have to wait until it closes and then  
**[0:26:39-0:26:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:26:39):**  it gets shipped and then I mean if it spices from India it can take a while obviously so  
**[0:26:43-0:26:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:26:43):**  also the speed there comes bigger but a bit of you take a bit of risk but should be compensated  
**[0:26:48-0:26:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:26:48):**  by the amount of people you have ordering in general.  
**[0:26:51-0:26:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:26:51):**  Of course you could still argue now that we are becoming like the supermarket so I think  
**[0:26:56-0:27:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:26:56):**  I just to show you a bit more like how that vision could look like so every week you get  
**[0:27:03-0:27:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:27:03):**  this availability the available products from our partners you can decide what you want  
**[0:27:09-0:27:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:27:09):**  to do what kind of a weekly order and the order will be based on the perishable product  
**[0:27:14-0:27:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:27:14):**  on the fresh product which has to come directly from the farm because everything else doesn't  
**[0:27:19-0:27:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:27:19):**  make sense but based on all the data we have we know that you know so many people will  
**[0:27:27-0:27:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:27:27):**  order some olive oil together with the mango which of course also makes it makes it worth  
**[0:27:32-0:27:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:27:32):**  delivering it to your home and that will be feasible because we compared to the supermarket  
**[0:27:40-0:27:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:27:40):**  we will really base all that supply chain management on the data that we have from our  
**[0:27:46-0:27:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:27:46):**  end customers and we will pass it through the whole the supply chain till the producer  
**[0:27:52-0:27:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:27:52):**  know so even the producer gets access to that data and can plan accordingly.  
**[0:27:57-0:28:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:27:57):**  What happens at the supermarket of course the supermarket also collects all that data  
**[0:28:02-0:28:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:28:02):**  and they have many more customers and much more accurate data projections but it stops  
**[0:28:07-0:28:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:28:07):**  at the marketing they will use it to do a better marketing for their customers but then  
**[0:28:13-0:28:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:28:13):**  behind you have this sort of like pyramid system of traders one middleman who is handing  
**[0:28:19-0:28:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:28:19):**  the product on to the others and they make sure that whatever the supermarket needs is  
**[0:28:25-0:28:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:28:25):**  available and that's where it becomes not feasible or unsustainable for a diversified  
**[0:28:31-0:28:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:28:31):**  farm.  
**[0:28:32-0:28:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:28:32):**  So we will create a model which is based on data but where the data is passed on through  
**[0:28:38-0:28:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:28:38):**  the supply chain up to the producer.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:28:42):**  And would you see then you starting a conversation with the producer as well to diversify the  
**[0:28:50-0:28:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:28:50):**  farm or to maybe introduce crops that you know you can sell or products that you know  
**[0:28:54-0:28:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:28:54):**  you see a demand from.  
**[0:28:56-0:29:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:28:56):**  How far do you see that conversation going is it going to be a one-way street just feeding  
**[0:29:01-0:29:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:29:01):**  information look next year we'll need X bottles or X jars or X mangoes or actually if you  
**[0:29:08-0:29:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:29:08):**  would introduce YZ with your rotation or in your first year system we actually have a  
**[0:29:13-0:29:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:29:13):**  market for it because we know this.  
**[0:29:15-0:29:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:29:15):**  How close do you see those things will be a one-way street or actually a conversation?  
**[0:29:20-0:29:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:29:20):**  It already happens from both sides so for instance our partners in Sicily they tell  
**[0:29:27-0:29:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:29:27):**  us yeah it would be better for our crop rotation system if we include topi nambur or something  
**[0:29:33-0:29:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:29:33):**  like this.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:29:34):**  Do you think you have a market for this?  
**[0:29:36-0:29:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:29:36):**  So we try to see if we have sold a similar product and we try to of course make a forecast.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:29:43):**  I don't think there's a similar product with the topi nambur.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:29:46):**  It's quite an artichoke just for that.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:29:48):**  Artichokes yeah maybe.  
**[0:29:49-0:29:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:29:49):**  It's quite a specific.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:29:51):**  No we they make a paste out of it that's a real case so they make a paste out of the  
**[0:29:56-0:30:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:29:56):**  fit so we have compared it to certain pestos and certain kind of sources that we offer  
**[0:30:02-0:30:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:30:02):**  and we told them yeah okay probably there will be a demand probably we can sell so and  
**[0:30:08-0:30:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:30:08):**  so much of this so they did a test and then we sold it and it worked out well so now they  
**[0:30:13-0:30:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:30:13):**  have been able to include that into their crop rotation.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:30:17):**  That is happening all the time which a supermarket would never ever even imagine it's not even  
**[0:30:22-0:30:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:30:22):**  in their vocabulary to suggest something like that.  
**[0:30:24-0:30:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:30:24):**  That's fascinating.  
**[0:30:25-0:30:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:30:25):**  Yeah there is the other way around it's like you figure out that topi nambur is a very  
**[0:30:29-0:30:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:30:29):**  hip thing to eat at the moment so you will look for a trader who can offer topi nambur  
**[0:30:34-0:30:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:30:34):**  in the right quality and then you look for another tool to make sure that you get always  
**[0:30:39-0:30:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:30:39):**  supply and where it ends up in terms of production you have no clue and of course at the moment  
**[0:30:46-0:30:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:30:46):**  this is still on a very you know we talk a lot together and try to figure out what will  
**[0:30:52-0:30:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:30:52):**  work and I'm sure that in the future this will be much more data based because we see  
**[0:30:57-0:31:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:30:57):**  it with products for instance tomato sauce, basata is turning really fast and there we  
**[0:31:04-0:31:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:31:04):**  only talk about numbers you know there you already see that you have the data you have  
**[0:31:08-0:31:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:31:08):**  the certainty how much you can sell and farmers are asking what would you forecast based on  
**[0:31:14-0:31:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:31:14):**  the past sales numbers.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:31:17):**  Which is an amazing discussion to have because they can plan for next year and potentially  
**[0:31:21-0:31:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:31:21):**  next years and of course their rotation might change where to put the tomatoes and the topi  
**[0:31:25-0:31:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:31:25):**  nambur etc.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:31:26):**  Exactly so our vision is really you know in the end we will have a system where the farmer  
**[0:31:31-0:31:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:31:31):**  can access some sort of back end and put in yeah if I would grow barley next year how  
**[0:31:37-0:31:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:31:37):**  much could I sell through the crowd container channel and the system will give him you know  
**[0:31:42-0:31:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:31:42):**  a number with a certain level of uncertainty and will say okay 90% sure you can sell that  
**[0:31:50-0:31:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:31:50):**  many tons of barley.  
**[0:31:51-0:31:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:31:51):**  For this and this price and then you can decide if it's worth the risk to engage in that.  
**[0:31:58-0:32:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:31:58):**  Yeah or rather the other way around in terms of pricing the farmer puts the price that  
**[0:32:02-0:32:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:32:02):**  he needs to grow it in a way which is sustainable for him and then based on that our engine  
**[0:32:09-0:32:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:32:09):**  will tell him how much he can sell with that price.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:32:13):**  That makes more sense how long do you envision before a system like that I mean that complex  
**[0:32:18-0:32:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:32:18):**  but is it years from now is it something you're already building is it 10 plus years or do  
**[0:32:23-0:32:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:32:23):**  you feel from what you've seen going from the individual pilots to much more structured  
**[0:32:29-0:32:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:32:29):**  and fluid system at the moment but this of course what you pictured now is a few steps  
**[0:32:33-0:32:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:32:33):**  further what do you envision there is it something we can talk about 12 months from now is it  
**[0:32:38-0:32:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:32:38):**  a few years.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:32:40):**  We want to fully replace this crowd ordering model by a prognostic model in the next three  
**[0:32:46-0:32:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:32:46):**  years then it will not be based on you know crazy artificial intelligence with a lot of  
**[0:32:53-0:32:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:32:53):**  metadata hopefully that will come further down the road but within the next three years  
**[0:32:59-0:33:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:32:59):**  with statistical models maybe with some bringing in some first easy to handle metadata like  
**[0:33:06-0:33:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:33:06):**  calendar and stuff like this we are already testing that we will be able to replace it  
**[0:33:11-0:33:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:33:11):**  with a prognostic model and hopefully then refine the prognostic model step by step until  
**[0:33:19-0:33:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:33:19):**  we can do a yearly planning with the farmers based on that prognostic model which will  
**[0:33:24-0:33:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:33:24):**  probably take yeah another two three years.  
**[0:33:29-0:33:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:33:29):**  Super interesting.  
**[0:33:30-0:33:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:33:30):**  So but it's not I mean the technology is there we are testing it with some individual pilot  
**[0:33:35-0:33:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:33:35):**  it works both for farmers and for consumers and for us also I mean this pre ordering or  
**[0:33:41-0:33:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:33:41):**  you know that the earlier ordering of the stuff from Italy hasn't really increased our  
**[0:33:45-0:33:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:33:45):**  risk a lot we know what we are going to sell so we feel pretty sure that this can become  
**[0:33:53-0:33:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:33:53):**  reality.  
**[0:33:54-0:33:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:33:54):**  And switching gears a bit and a few questions I always like to ask on the investing side  
**[0:33:59-0:34:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:33:59):**  of things you are fundraising you have been talking to a lot of impact investors in Europe  
**[0:34:04-0:34:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:34:04):**  probably I would say all of them but many what have you seen like is there compared  
**[0:34:08-0:34:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:34:08):**  to three four years ago or four years ago actually when you started or five even is  
**[0:34:13-0:34:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:34:13):**  there more interest and what do you feel like is missing are investors actually getting  
**[0:34:18-0:34:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:34:18):**  interested in that layer on of the farm or is it still a lot of discussion on ag tech  
**[0:34:24-0:34:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:34:24):**  and land buying and regenerating in the region ag and food space what do you see when you  
**[0:34:28-0:34:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:34:28):**  talk to investors that are reaching out to you you reach out to them obviously discussing  
**[0:34:33-0:34:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:34:33):**  the food system.  
**[0:34:35-0:34:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:34:35):**  As you said we are currently fundraising and we are close to closing the actual round  
**[0:34:42-0:34:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:34:42):**  and this would not have happened I think 10 years ago because when I was still working  
**[0:34:48-0:34:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:34:48):**  in that other company in the trading company discussions were far away from that we were  
**[0:34:53-0:35:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:34:53):**  already also engaged with the impact investment funds and I think it has changed quite a bit  
**[0:35:01-0:35:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:35:01):**  the understanding of the systemic importance of the food system and to understand it and  
**[0:35:10-0:35:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:35:10):**  also to really see it as an investment opportunity that kind of understanding has not been there  
**[0:35:17-0:35:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:35:17):**  at that time it was purely like is it really fair trade what you are doing or is it organic  
**[0:35:22-0:35:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:35:22):**  I am more from this fair trade space so I invest in that how much premium do the farmers  
**[0:35:27-0:35:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:35:27):**  get but a more systemic view is definitely something that is coming up that we are feeling.  
**[0:35:34-0:35:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:35:34):**  And what would you do if you would be in charge of a large investment fund let's say I don't  
**[0:35:39-0:35:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:35:39):**  know how much it exactly is I think it's quite close to the euro one billion Swiss franc  
**[0:35:43-0:35:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:35:43):**  you'll be an investor tomorrow you have a very long view if you want to or a very short  
**[0:35:47-0:35:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:35:47):**  one could also be the case apart from obviously closing the fundraising round of crowd container  
**[0:35:52-0:35:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:35:52):**  but what would you focus the rest of an investment fund that size on if you had free range of  
**[0:35:58-0:36:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:35:58):**  choosing in the food and egg space how would you put that to work?  
**[0:36:01-0:36:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:36:01):**  I think in the beginning as a first step it would be very important still to invest in  
**[0:36:06-0:36:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:36:06):**  consumer awareness to really find smart projects that are investable form the sort of awareness  
**[0:36:14-0:36:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:36:14):**  on both ecological and health aspects of food on the other hand on the production side I  
**[0:36:22-0:36:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:36:22):**  already mentioned that I think there is a lot to be done to create lighter and smarter  
**[0:36:28-0:36:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:36:28):**  equipment that really helps diversified farms and cheaper ones and cheaper ones of course  
**[0:36:35-0:36:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:36:35):**  also and you need a certain scale to build you know cheaper and smart and light equipment.  
**[0:36:43-0:36:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:36:43):**  It's not the sexiest part of the sector but equipment is something I keep hearing as well  
**[0:36:47-0:36:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:36:47):**  like we need to reinvent everything around a tractor you possibly imagine everything  
**[0:36:51-0:36:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:36:51):**  around all the harvesting equipment the processing equipment simply weeding equipment I mean  
**[0:36:56-0:37:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:36:56):**  there's such an amount of innovation needed there that it's a huge not a very sexy but  
**[0:37:02-0:37:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:37:02):**  a huge opportunity.  
**[0:37:03-0:37:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:37:03):**  Yeah but I think first the farmer needs to be sure that there is a demand for this type  
**[0:37:09-0:37:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:37:09):**  of products otherwise it doesn't make sense to invest in it.  
**[0:37:13-0:37:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:37:13):**  So on the consumer sorry on the consumer awareness side what would you focus on you said health  
**[0:37:18-0:37:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:37:18):**  and ecology what would be the main if you had this definitely stolen from Tim Ferriss  
**[0:37:23-0:37:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:37:23):**  but the huge billboard in San Francisco where I don't know how many people or a gigantic  
**[0:37:27-0:37:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:37:27):**  billboard somewhere where I don't know a billion people pass pass by what would you put on  
**[0:37:32-0:37:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:37:32):**  it like what would be your focus point on ecology and health to get many more consumers  
**[0:37:38-0:37:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:37:38):**  interested in like looking at food differently not just at feed but actually at food.  
**[0:37:43-0:37:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:37:43):**  That growing really matters I think is a lot of misperceptions around you know that packaging  
**[0:37:52-0:37:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:37:52):**  or transportation are the most important parts and you can consult any life cycle assessment  
**[0:37:58-0:38:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:37:58):**  of food and you see that growing that food is really the like paramount part of the footprint  
**[0:38:06-0:38:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:38:06):**  of a product and that's both in ecological terms it goes far beyond co2 it but also on  
**[0:38:14-0:38:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:38:14):**  the social side so many people involved into growing a product and like packaging bit or  
**[0:38:20-0:38:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:38:20):**  the transportation are just very small parts of it so I think that's something that people  
**[0:38:26-0:38:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:38:26):**  have to understand that you know how you grow it it will fundamentally impact the ecosystems  
**[0:38:33-0:38:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:38:33):**  and the people but it will also fundamentally impact you as a person like what are you really  
**[0:38:40-0:38:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:38:40):**  eating there it really makes a huge difference.  
**[0:38:43-0:38:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:38:43):**  And it's such a complex story how would you get that to the masses how would you I mean  
**[0:38:52-0:38:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:38:52):**  maybe you don't have an answer to that but how would you spend that billion or invest  
**[0:38:55-0:39:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:38:55):**  a billion or a similar size amount to get the masses to understand also if you are living  
**[0:39:02-0:39:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:39:02):**  below the poverty line if you are rushing through a supermarket to get something quick  
**[0:39:07-0:39:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:39:07):**  on the table for your children and you're juggling two or three jobs like how do you  
**[0:39:10-0:39:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:39:10):**  get people to see the importance of food and the growing part of it.  
**[0:39:15-0:39:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:39:15):**  I think there are two sides to that I mean one thing is we are currently prototyping  
**[0:39:20-0:39:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:39:20):**  how to make you know how to create that sort of awareness or understanding and we work  
**[0:39:27-0:39:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:39:27):**  a lot with storytelling but we also work a lot with communities so we kind of use communities  
**[0:39:34-0:39:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:39:34):**  or try to involve communities to really spread that message and that's much more efficient  
**[0:39:40-0:39:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:39:40):**  than just doing online ads.  
**[0:39:43-0:39:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:39:43):**  On the other hand it's a very important thing that you mentioned that you know people below  
**[0:39:47-0:39:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:39:47):**  poverty line or people who have just so many things in their daily life that they will  
**[0:39:53-0:40:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:39:53):**  just not be able to focus on it and I'm quite sure there is also some policy part to it.  
**[0:40:00-0:40:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:40:00):**  So I think when you think about really the fundamental transition that the food system  
**[0:40:05-0:40:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:40:05):**  has to go through there has to be this like businesses and market actors but there's also  
**[0:40:12-0:40:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:40:12):**  a policy part and for me if I had this like magic wand to change something now.  
**[0:40:18-0:40:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:40:18):**  You're stealing my next question but go ahead.  
**[0:40:21-0:40:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:40:21):**  Then I would really introduce a policy that makes sure that true cost accounting is applied  
**[0:40:30-0:40:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:40:30):**  across the whole value chains and that at the end when you buy a product you really  
**[0:40:37-0:40:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:40:37):**  pay a price that somehow has internalized all these externalities and that is not only  
**[0:40:43-0:40:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:40:43):**  negative externalities but also positives ones like health.  
**[0:40:48-0:40:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:40:48):**  By eating healthy food you get prevented from getting ill and thereby for instance the state  
**[0:40:55-0:40:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:40:55):**  can save some health costs.  
**[0:40:59-0:41:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:40:59):**  So it's very important that both sides are calculated or factored into that true cost  
**[0:41:04-0:41:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:41:04):**  and that will also make healthy food much more affordable.  
**[0:41:08-0:41:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:41:08):**  Eating against disease.  
**[0:41:10-0:41:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:41:10):**  I think the policy piece we haven't focused a lot on in the podcast we should do it more  
**[0:41:15-0:41:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:41:15):**  I just find it very difficult to grasp what's the role of investors and food companies but  
**[0:41:21-0:41:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:41:21):**  I think lobbying there is just as important as the fossil fuel industry and honestly the  
**[0:41:26-0:41:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:41:26):**  extractive food and agriculture industry is very good at and we need to just as we need  
**[0:41:31-0:41:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:41:31):**  to learn how to use the tool finance and money in this sector we also need to learn how to  
**[0:41:37-0:41:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:41:37):**  use the tool lobbying because that's potentially the biggest lever we have.  
**[0:41:42-0:41:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:41:42):**  Like the moment you change certain policies and many farmers are doing many things that  
**[0:41:48-0:41:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:41:48):**  aren't even allowed in their region like they're mixing cropping systems, they're integrating  
**[0:41:51-0:41:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:41:51):**  animals with olive trees which in many places is not even allowed for good reasons because  
**[0:41:55-0:42:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:41:55):**  we created an industrial ag system where that was very dangerous but these are the pioneers  
**[0:42:00-0:42:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:42:00):**  that are doing everything that isn't officially legal but creating the most amazing food and  
**[0:42:05-0:42:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:42:05):**  having all these positive externalities so something has to change there but yeah we  
**[0:42:09-0:42:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:42:09):**  have the time to lobby and who has the resources to lobby in Brussels, in Washington, in New  
**[0:42:14-0:42:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:42:14):**  Delhi, in anywhere where power resides to change those policies that's going to be a  
**[0:42:19-0:42:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:42:19):**  big question I think in the years to come especially in Europe as the next gap is coming  
**[0:42:24-0:42:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:42:24):**  up in four or five years and of course the farm bill in the US has an enormous impact  
**[0:42:28-0:42:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:42:28):**  as well where levers are changed and that's something we cover very often on the podcast.  
**[0:42:34-0:42:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:42:34):**  Absolutely but I think the role of business is really to show that it is possible, that  
**[0:42:39-0:42:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:42:39):**  it is feasible, that there is also a demand, that there are consumers who understand it  
**[0:42:44-0:42:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:42:44):**  and who want it and you can criticize a lot what is happening in the organic space but  
**[0:42:50-0:42:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:42:50):**  this is they definitely had a big impact also on policies by just showing that it is technically  
**[0:42:57-0:43:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:42:57):**  possible to grow a crop without using chemical fertilizers and that has triggered a lot of  
**[0:43:05-0:43:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:43:05):**  policies also and I think that's a role model also for what we are doing by just showing  
**[0:43:12-0:43:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:43:12):**  what is possible, showing that it is also an attractive choice and then the lobbying  
**[0:43:17-0:43:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:43:17):**  can really kick in and change things. If there is nothing there or nothing visible you will  
**[0:43:23-0:43:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:43:23):**  not be able to lobby and that's also why this lobbying for a thing that is already there  
**[0:43:27-0:43:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:43:27):**  is always much easier to defend the status quo.  
**[0:43:31-0:43:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:43:31):**  And you have potentially in this case 10,000 but in a few years 100,000 people that you  
**[0:43:36-0:43:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:43:36):**  can mobilize and push and sign and potentially get on the street etc. because you need large  
**[0:43:43-0:43:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:43:43):**  movements to change policies and to push policies as well. So it's something I hope to do more  
**[0:43:50-0:43:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:43:50):**  interviews on that even though it's not the core part of this podcast.  
**[0:43:55-0:44:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:43:55):**  But I'm looking forward to it. I'm also very interested in that question. I mean often  
**[0:44:00-0:44:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:44:00):**  it is also played one thing against the other. Should business solve it or should politics  
**[0:44:05-0:44:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:44:05):**  solve it and I don't see it like this. My theory of change is really that business shows  
**[0:44:12-0:44:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:44:12):**  what is feasible, that the pioneers really make things possible and then we need some  
**[0:44:20-0:44:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:44:20):**  policies which make it also accessible for all groups of the population.  
**[0:44:24-0:44:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:44:24):**  Yeah, we've seen that with renewable energy which is by no means perfect but has done  
**[0:44:29-0:44:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:44:29):**  – really came out of a few pioneers that spent way too much money for the solar panels  
**[0:44:34-0:44:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:44:34):**  at the beginning and brought down the cost curve and obviously with all the issues on  
**[0:44:39-0:44:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:44:39):**  production side but really showed that it's an alternative. Then policies followed partly  
**[0:44:44-0:44:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:44:44):**  first in Germany that really kickstarted a lot and then many followed and now it's an  
**[0:44:48-0:44:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:44:48):**  industry that moves ahead. Still it's going too slow. We need more smart goods, better  
**[0:44:53-0:44:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:44:53):**  storage solutions, better recycling and all of that. But it's an unstoppable force. It  
**[0:44:57-0:45:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:44:57):**  keeps going because it was started by a few pioneers that paid and some policies and then  
**[0:45:03-0:45:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:45:03):**  a lot of very, very, very hard work. And I feel like we're at the beginning of that.  
**[0:45:07-0:45:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:45:07):**  I hope we go faster than that one. But to end with a final question, what do you believe  
**[0:45:12-0:45:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:45:12):**  to be true about agriculture, about regenerative agriculture that others don't? Like where  
**[0:45:16-0:45:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:45:16):**  are you contrarian? Which is definitely a question inspired by John Kempf. He usually  
**[0:45:20-0:45:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:45:20):**  asks a similar question on this podcast.  
**[0:45:24-0:45:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:45:24):**  I think it relates to what we have been talking about the policy also. I see in regenerative  
**[0:45:31-0:45:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:45:31):**  agriculture really a force that can unite and be very inclusive. I feel it can somehow  
**[0:45:39-0:45:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:45:39):**  help to bridge the gaps between conventional farming and organic farming, between movements  
**[0:45:45-0:45:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:45:45):**  like the biodynamic movement and the agroecological movement. I think the worst thing we could  
**[0:45:51-0:45:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:45:51):**  do would be to become another small group, small movement that says that we have the  
**[0:45:57-0:46:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:45:57):**  only truth. But I really see that it is very deeply rooted in the regenerative movement,  
**[0:46:03-0:46:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:46:03):**  that there is this openness and inclusiveness and that respect also for the individuality  
**[0:46:09-0:46:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:46:09):**  of each production system of each farm. And I hope that we can extend this also and really  
**[0:46:16-0:46:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:46:16):**  with that, yeah, really unite these forces to make a transition of the food system possible.  
**[0:46:25-0:46:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:46:25):**  And with that, I want to thank you so much for showing up in a very, very busy time and  
**[0:46:30-0:46:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:46:30):**  not only logistically, but fundraising as well and many other things and sharing your

**[0:47:27-0:47:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:47:27):**  Dear friends of the podcast, I'm super excited to share with you the online video course  
**[0:47:31-0:47:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:47:31):**  Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[0:47:35-0:47:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:47:35):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it. Why are we doing this  
**[0:47:40-0:47:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:47:40):**  course? After 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question how  
**[0:47:45-0:47:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:47:45):**  to put money to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011  
**[0:47:50-0:47:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:47:50):**  and recording this podcast since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  
**[0:47:55-0:47:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:47:55):**  What have we seen in the space over the last years? How have we built our decision making  
**[0:47:59-0:48:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:47:59):**  framework? What to focus on with the podcast? How have we picked interviewees? What questions  
**[0:48:05-0:48:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:48:05):**  should you ask? What is happening in the space? What should you read? What should you listen?  
**[0:48:10-0:48:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:48:10):**  What should you watch? How to approach this space? For whom is this course? You, the soil  
**[0:48:16-0:48:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:48:16):**  builders and investors in this space. The soil builders, people working in this space,  
**[0:48:20-0:48:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:48:20):**  entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers, vehicle builders, crowd investing, platform builders,  
**[0:48:25-0:48:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:48:25):**  ag tech companies, farm to gut food companies, permaculture, key line designers, holistic  
**[0:48:30-0:48:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:48:30):**  management consultants, etc. People that are building soil at scale. And the investors  
**[0:48:36-0:48:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:48:36):**  who are putting their own money to work through their family office or as private individuals  
**[0:48:39-0:48:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:48:39):**  or people who are putting other people's money to work through foundations, institutional  
**[0:48:45-0:48:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:48:45):**  capital, banks, insurance companies, etc. Is this course free? No. This is pay what  
**[0:48:50-0:48:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:48:50):**  you think it's worth. Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth  
**[0:48:55-0:49:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:48:55):**  to you and I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast we have people with  
**[0:49:00-0:49:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:49:00):**  very different means. So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you and  
**[0:49:05-0:49:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:49:05):**  if you have the means to consider paying what you think it's worth. Thank you.  
**[0:49:10-0:49:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:49:10):**  So what is this course? It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15  
**[0:49:16-0:49:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:49:16):**  minutes plus PDF slides so you don't have to ride along. We're going to look into why  
**[0:49:21-0:49:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:49:21):**  invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture is so risky, how to  
**[0:49:26-0:49:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:49:26):**  invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to invest in,  
**[0:49:32-0:49:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:49:32):**  what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find if you're  
**[0:49:35-0:49:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:49:35):**  a soil builder. Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of  
**[0:49:41-0:49:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:49:41):**  reports, what kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to  
**[0:49:45-0:49:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:49:45):**  dig deeper. We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:49:50-0:49:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:49:50):**  So what is it not? It's not a list of investable deals. Unfortunately that doesn't exist in  
**[0:49:55-0:49:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:49:55):**  this world. We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:49:59-0:50:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:49:59):**  It's also not investment advice. Before making any investment please find professional investment  
**[0:50:05-0:50:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/tobias-joos#t=0:50:05):**  advice. So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking,

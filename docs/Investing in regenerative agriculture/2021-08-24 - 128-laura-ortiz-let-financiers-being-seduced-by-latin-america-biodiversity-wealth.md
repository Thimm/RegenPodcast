**[0:00:13-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:00:13):**  Why are most voices in the regenerative movement coming from the global north and why simply  
**[0:00:18-0:00:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:00:18):**  investing in regenerative agriculture isn't good enough and what does real regenerative  
**[0:00:22-0:00:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:00:22):**  investing look like?  
**[0:00:23-0:00:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:00:23):**  And how does that touch historically difficult topics for investors like control, trust and  
**[0:00:28-0:00:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:00:28):**  more?

**[0:00:34-0:00:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:00:34):**  wealth?  
**[0:00:37-0:00:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:00:37):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture, Investing as if  
**[0:00:41-0:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:00:41):**  the Planet Mattered.  
**[0:00:42-0:00:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:00:42):**  A podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:47-0:00:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:00:47):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:00:52-0:00:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:00:52):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:57-0:00:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:00:57):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:59-0:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:00:59):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:03-0:01:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:01:03):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:01:05):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:10-0:01:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:01:10):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.

**[0:01:41-0:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:01:41):**  Welcome to another episode today with the Chief Purpose Officer and co-founder of SVX  
**[0:01:45-0:01:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:01:45):**  Mexico.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:01:46):**  Welcome Laura.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:01:47):**  Thank you Koen, it's great to be here.  
**[0:01:50-0:01:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:01:50):**  And to start with the personal question we always love to ask, how did you end up focusing  
**[0:01:54-0:01:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:01:54):**  on regeneration, on soil, on agriculture and land use?  
**[0:01:57-0:01:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:01:57):**  Wow, it's been quite a journey.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:01:59):**  I used to be a banker back in 2008.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:02:03):**  I was in two very big institutions and you know, being very competitive and learning  
**[0:02:08-0:02:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:02:08):**  so much about finance and something inside me kept questioning the ethical issues about  
**[0:02:16-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:02:16):**  my everyday activities.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:02:19):**  And there was some health issues as well.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:02:21):**  And of course, you know, some ethical dilemmas in general where you start questioning and  
**[0:02:26-0:02:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:02:26):**  your life.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:02:28):**  And I was 29 years old when I had my first panic attack.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:02:32):**  And that day for me was an inflection point.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:02:35):**  I was laying on the floor of my office and I was thinking that if I died that day, I  
**[0:02:40-0:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:02:40):**  would have only helped the rich become richer.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:02:44):**  And I did not want my life to be that.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:02:46):**  I used to be very different before I was a banker.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:02:49):**  So I decided to quit the bank and I decided to look for ethical investments or ethical  
**[0:02:54-0:02:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:02:54):**  banking.  
**[0:02:55-0:02:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:02:55):**  I didn't even know it existed.  
**[0:02:56-0:03:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:02:56):**  In Mexico, all of those trends, you know, were not very much alive at the moment.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:03:01):**  So I started learning about impact investment and I started learning about responsible investments.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:03:07):**  And my quest started in 2014.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:03:10):**  And finally, in 2016, I got to meet John Fullerton from the Capital Institute.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:03:16):**  And John Fullerton was talking about regenerative economy.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:03:19):**  And from that day, it was like I found my calling.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:03:23):**  I found my mission.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:03:25):**  And I definitely thought like I was really excited by impact investing since 2014.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:03:32):**  But I was wondering that impact was so vague and everything and anything was considered  
**[0:03:38-0:03:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:03:38):**  impactful that I was wondering where the direction of impact was going and even if it had any  
**[0:03:45-0:03:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:03:45):**  direction at all.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:03:46):**  So when I finally came across regenerative economy, for me, that really, really gave  
**[0:03:51-0:03:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:03:51):**  me direction and that gave me purpose and that gave me so much more.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:03:57):**  And in the first months of getting to know John Fullerton, we were invited to a regenerative  
**[0:04:01-0:04:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:04:01):**  retreat precisely where I put my hands in the soil.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:04:05):**  And this was in a farm in northern New York.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:04:08):**  It was just an amazing experience.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:04:10):**  We really spoke with the farmers.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:04:12):**  We really literally dug our hands into the soil, learned about all the processes and  
**[0:04:17-0:04:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:04:17):**  all the synchropies that you can learn in the natural processes.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:04:22):**  And we could really, we really got to see the differences of land assets that were regenerated  
**[0:04:28-0:04:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:04:28):**  with some years versus the ones that were just beginning.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:04:31):**  And we started to see like the differences.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:04:34):**  And I was just overwhelmed with emotion and excitement and saying, wow, like this is something  
**[0:04:40-0:04:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:04:40):**  worth dedicating your life to.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:04:42):**  And this is something worth, you know, a life mission.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:04:45):**  So ever since I started learning about impact investing, there's a quote that has been my  
**[0:04:50-0:04:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:04:50):**  mission, which is that capital serves humanity instead of governing it.  
**[0:04:56-0:05:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:04:56):**  And so putting capital at the service has really made me reflect a lot about like who  
**[0:05:02-0:05:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:05:02):**  has been at the service of humanity all these years and who has been like the most generous  
**[0:05:08-0:05:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:05:08):**  bank in the history of humankind.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:05:10):**  And of course the most generous bank in the history of humankind has been the soil that  
**[0:05:14-0:05:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:05:14):**  is very distributed by design and that is always nourishing and that is always nourishing  
**[0:05:20-0:05:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:05:20):**  everyone.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:05:21):**  So for me, the soil is literally the example of how I want a bank to be in the future and  
**[0:05:28-0:05:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:05:28):**  for capital to be like the water.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:05:31):**  And basically like started to reflect on how to really put all of those metaphors into  
**[0:05:37-0:05:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:05:37):**  real action.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:05:39):**  And that's how I started.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:05:41):**  Super inspiring.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:05:42):**  And putting your hands in this.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:05:44):**  So I think many can reflect on that as well or can recognize and listening to this, that  
**[0:05:49-0:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:05:49):**  it's a very, if you haven't grown up on a farm, of course, or with a big garden or having  
**[0:05:54-0:05:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:05:54):**  spent the summers digging in soil, that it's a very profound experience.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:05:58):**  So bringing that back to Mexico, because Northern New York is very different.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:06:01):**  What were your first steps?  
**[0:06:02-0:06:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:06:02):**  How did you approach that?  
**[0:06:04-0:06:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:06:04):**  Putting that into practice?  
**[0:06:05-0:06:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:06:05):**  Well, a lot of things were going on at the time in Mexico and there was a fund in Mexico  
**[0:06:12-0:06:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:06:12):**  that is a sustainable agriculture fund that was called Grupo Paisano.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:06:17):**  And for me, the experience of getting to know them was definitely a life changing experience,  
**[0:06:23-0:06:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:06:23):**  precisely because they really took me to the farms and they really took me to eat and be  
**[0:06:28-0:06:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:06:28):**  with all these farmers.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:06:30):**  And I realized that the finance professionals, we are so far away from what is happening  
**[0:06:36-0:06:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:06:36):**  on the ground and on the grassroots communities.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:06:39):**  And the grassroots communities are really far away from what's happening in finance,  
**[0:06:43-0:06:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:06:43):**  right?  
**[0:06:44-0:06:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:06:44):**  So there's this huge distance between those two worlds.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:06:47):**  And there's two languages that are spoken that are very different.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:06:51):**  And when you put yourself at the service of something, you become kind of like a translator  
**[0:06:56-0:06:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:06:56):**  between those two different languages.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:06:59):**  And you really become much more humble because you understand that in finance, the finance  
**[0:07:04-0:07:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:07:04):**  world is very dominating, is very ego driven, and there's so much vocabulary that is just  
**[0:07:10-0:07:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:07:10):**  fancy on purpose so that people don't understand it.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:07:15):**  And so the more I tried to hyper simplify concepts and the more I tried to see how much  
**[0:07:21-0:07:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:07:21):**  understanding could come from a farmer of a financial concept, the more I realized what  
**[0:07:28-0:07:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:07:28):**  is my vocation and my real mission there as that translator between those two worlds.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:07:33):**  So one example that I wanted to bring up because of that fund was that this fund wanted to  
**[0:07:39-0:07:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:07:39):**  be a social justice fund for the farmers.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:07:42):**  And they wanted to bring the solidarity economy to the farmers.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:07:46):**  And what they wanted to do is that the entity where the investment comes in was structured  
**[0:07:52-0:07:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:07:52):**  so that it would be exited by the investors and bought back completely by the smallholder  
**[0:07:58-0:07:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:07:58):**  farmers.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:07:59):**  So at the end of the investment period of, let's say, 10 to 12 years, 100 percent of  
**[0:08:05-0:08:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:08:05):**  the company will belong to the farmers.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:08:08):**  So that model was very contrarian in so many ways.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:08:12):**  And it's called self liquidating equity.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:08:14):**  And I was really wondering that some of the smallholder farmers that we were working with  
**[0:08:19-0:08:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:08:19):**  did not even know how to read and write.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:08:22):**  And I was really worried, like, how can they be shareholders if they don't know how to  
**[0:08:26-0:08:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:08:26):**  read and write?  
**[0:08:28-0:08:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:08:28):**  So I was taking some videos with my cell phone in the visits in the communities and I was  
**[0:08:33-0:08:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:08:33):**  asking one farmer, his name is Don Alejandro, and Don Alejandro was like very excited, you  
**[0:08:38-0:08:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:08:38):**  know, showing me his tomatoes and showing me like everything he was doing.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:08:42):**  And I asked Don Alejandro, hey, do you understand how this works?  
**[0:08:46-0:08:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:08:46):**  Do you understand like what structure they're proposing to you?  
**[0:08:50-0:08:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:08:50):**  And he was looking at me kind of offended and he was like, how do you even ask that  
**[0:08:55-0:08:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:08:55):**  question?  
**[0:08:56-0:08:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:08:56):**  Of course I understand.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:08:57):**  Right now I'm a partner, he said, and I used to be labor.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:09:01):**  And that's where I immediately understood, like, what is he understanding and what is  
**[0:09:07-0:09:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:09:07):**  the important stuff, the fundamental stuff of what they're doing?  
**[0:09:10-0:09:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:09:10):**  And he was right.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:09:11):**  He was absolutely right.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:09:12):**  And he gave me the example of like, you know, the way he took care of the truck when it  
**[0:09:17-0:09:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:09:17):**  was the truck of the boss is very different of the way he takes care of the truck now  
**[0:09:22-0:09:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:09:22):**  that it's his and everyone's.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:09:25):**  So it's just those tiny experiences, those little examples of the day by day, getting  
**[0:09:30-0:09:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:09:30):**  to know what's the reality for farmers versus what's the reality in the term sheet or the  
**[0:09:35-0:09:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:09:35):**  financial documents.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:09:37):**  And like looking at those gaps, but looking at the fundamental ways that you can bridge  
**[0:09:41-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:09:41):**  those gaps and that you can really translate and that you can really connect and that people  
**[0:09:46-0:09:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:09:46):**  can get excited in both sides.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:09:48):**  That was for me very life changing and I really enjoyed it.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:09:52):**  But I did not know regenerative agriculture until a couple of years later.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:09:57):**  So when I saw that regenerative agriculture could be very accessible and very inclusive  
**[0:10:04-0:10:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:10:04):**  and the fact that the input cost would be way less once you're in this new spiral of  
**[0:10:09-0:10:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:10:09):**  abundance, I even got more and more excited because the social justice that can come from  
**[0:10:15-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:10:15):**  that can be very powerful and the potential that you can unleash is amazing for everyone.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:10:22):**  So what I'm seeing right now in the impact investment ecosystem in Latin America at least  
**[0:10:28-0:10:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:10:28):**  is that there are very human centric, social centric initiatives and projects and organizations  
**[0:10:34-0:10:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:10:34):**  that are only taking into account like the social impacts.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:10:38):**  And then there's others that are working more on the conservation side and on the environmental  
**[0:10:43-0:10:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:10:43):**  side and they are usually very divided and they're not necessarily talking to each other  
**[0:10:49-0:10:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:10:49):**  because one is very human centric and very much looking at the social causes and the  
**[0:10:53-0:10:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:10:53):**  social indicators and the others are just looking at the trees and the species that  
**[0:10:58-0:11:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:10:58):**  they're conserving.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:11:00):**  And so usually this is work that is done separately.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:11:04):**  And in regenerative agriculture is the first time I saw that holistic potential where you  
**[0:11:09-0:11:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:11:09):**  can really work on both the social justice side and the environmental justice side at  
**[0:11:14-0:11:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:11:14):**  the same time and in a very indivisible and interconnected way.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:11:19):**  So for me that is like the most beautiful potential of like not having to work separately,  
**[0:11:26-0:11:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:11:26):**  not being a divorced cause, but rather a holistic one.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:11:31):**  And that way there is no way of saving any human rights or any humans if we don't have  
**[0:11:37-0:11:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:11:37):**  air to breathe and drinkable rivers and thriving ecosystems.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:11:41):**  And soils.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:11:42):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:11:43):**  So thriving communities need thriving ecosystems and vice versa.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:11:47):**  So that's where I got even more excited about this theme precisely because that's the way  
**[0:11:54-0:11:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:11:54):**  I want to engage in the world holistically.  
**[0:11:57-0:11:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:11:57):**  So that's extremely interesting.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:11:58):**  I always wonder, I love the alternative exit structures.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:12:01):**  I love this tinkering with those kinds of things, but what was the reaction or what  
**[0:12:04-0:12:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:12:04):**  have you seen in the future as well later on of investors that are still, it comes back  
**[0:12:09-0:12:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:12:09):**  time and time again in this podcast, they need or they are very used to the 10 year  
**[0:12:14-0:12:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:12:14):**  structure or a loan has to look like this, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:12:17):**  So what is your experience there after you have, let's say, seen that farmers, or at  
**[0:12:22-0:12:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:12:22):**  least the one you talked to was very aware of what he was signing up for, but what has  
**[0:12:26-0:12:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:12:26):**  been the reaction from investors to these kinds of, let's say, edgy structures?  
**[0:12:31-0:12:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:12:31):**  Well, we have taken the opportunity to always start with investor education.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:12:36):**  What we say is that we cultivate regenerative investors.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:12:41):**  That's our crop.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:12:43):**  So basically in SVX, we're cultivating investors and the way we do it is we start with education  
**[0:12:50-0:12:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:12:50):**  and the way we do the thought leadership around it is precisely starting with the holistic  
**[0:12:55-0:12:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:12:55):**  spectrum.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:12:56):**  And the holistic spectrum is just some thought leadership that we developed off of the spectrum  
**[0:13:01-0:13:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:13:01):**  of Bill Reed.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:13:02):**  Of course, you know, the quadrants of Bill Reed, right?  
**[0:13:04-0:13:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:13:04):**  So we just applied that to investments and we said, okay, there's destructive investments  
**[0:13:08-0:13:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:13:08):**  that lead you to massive death.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:13:11):**  And then there's extractive investments, which you all know, and then there's the responsible  
**[0:13:15-0:13:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:13:15):**  ones.  
**[0:13:16-0:13:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:13:16):**  And the one in the middle, the bridge one is of course, sustainable investments because  
**[0:13:20-0:13:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:13:20):**  that's the neutrality point, right?  
**[0:13:22-0:13:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:13:22):**  That's the net zeros and all of those that are minimizing damage, but are not necessarily  
**[0:13:27-0:13:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:13:27):**  adding value.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:13:29):**  So after the sustainable investments, we see the social enterprise.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:13:34):**  In the social enterprise, you start with the end of a, you know, of a purpose as a social  
**[0:13:39-0:13:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:13:39):**  or environmental purpose to solve.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:13:41):**  So you start adding value, but then there's transformative finance and in transformative  
**[0:13:46-0:13:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:13:46):**  finance, I have found the most amazing structures, the most exciting structures and the most  
**[0:13:50-0:13:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:13:50):**  fun structures, but precisely the ones that require a new paradigm of thinking from the  
**[0:13:56-0:13:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:13:56):**  investors.  
**[0:13:57-0:14:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:13:57):**  And the transformative paradigm, I don't know if you've ever had a podcast with Andrea  
**[0:14:00-0:14:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:14:00):**  Armeni or Morgan Simon.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:14:02):**  No, not yet.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:14:04):**  So Morgan actually was one of the co-founders of Tonic back in the day, but she's also the  
**[0:14:07-0:14:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:14:07):**  co-founder of transform finance.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:14:09):**  And in her book of real impact, she has three principles, but they are basically summed  
**[0:14:13-0:14:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:14:13):**  up in nothing for me without me, which means instead of looking at farmers or whoever as  
**[0:14:20-0:14:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:14:20):**  beneficiaries, you actually think of them as partners.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:14:24):**  And it is very different to think of somebody as a recipient of impact versus somebody as  
**[0:14:29-0:14:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:14:29):**  a change maker and that everyone can be a change maker.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:14:33):**  So in those principles, you kind of talk a lot about how they can be owners.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:14:38):**  If they're not co-owners, co-designers with you, it is very likely that you are getting  
**[0:14:44-0:14:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:14:44):**  the better off end than somebody else of your stakeholders.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:14:48):**  So those transformative finance principles for me really changed my life in terms of  
**[0:14:53-0:14:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:14:53):**  the financial structures that we want to favor.  
**[0:14:55-0:14:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:14:55):**  We want to favor the ones that are distributive by design.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:14:58):**  We want to favor the ones that are collaborating and we want to re-indigenize finance.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:15:03):**  So we have a lot to learn from the indigenous communities.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:15:06):**  They have been the stewards of the biodiversity all this time.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:15:09):**  They are regenerative by nature.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:15:12):**  They have like all the principles, they're just there.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:15:15):**  So we have a lot to learn from them.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:15:17):**  So the power dynamic of transformative finance is really transformative because instead of  
**[0:15:24-0:15:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:15:24):**  the investors being the decision makers on top and that very toxic power dynamic of domination,  
**[0:15:31-0:15:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:15:31):**  it becomes more of a conversation where everyone learns.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:15:34):**  And instead of us coming to the communities to teach them how to do stuff, we come to  
**[0:15:39-0:15:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:15:39):**  learn.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:15:40):**  We come open to listen.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:15:42):**  We come open to value their voice and their wisdom and what they already know, right?  
**[0:15:48-0:15:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:15:48):**  That is very different from coming from this domination paradigm.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:15:52):**  And instead of risk shifting, it's risk assuming.  
**[0:15:56-0:16:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:15:56):**  So we assume risk because everything else that finance does is shift risk around to  
**[0:16:03-0:16:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:16:03):**  the stakeholders that are the most vulnerable.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:16:05):**  And of course, the risk to the investor is like one or 2% of their return and the risk  
**[0:16:11-0:16:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:16:11):**  to the farmer is like their livelihood and their skin and their sight and everything  
**[0:16:18-0:16:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:16:18):**  and their families.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:16:19):**  So it's very different.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:16:21):**  And in the transform finance principles, that is like the center.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:16:24):**  That is very important.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:16:25):**  So that's where the self liquidating equity comes in.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:16:28):**  And like all of these structures start making sense once you understand the transformative  
**[0:16:33-0:16:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:16:33):**  finance principles.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:16:35):**  And what we say is that to get to regenerative investments, the portal is a transformative  
**[0:16:39-0:16:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:16:39):**  finance because we think regenerative finance is not only about what you're investing, it's  
**[0:16:44-0:16:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:16:44):**  also how you're investing in it and why, of course, if we're still investing for the purpose  
**[0:16:50-0:16:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:16:50):**  of perpetuating capital and capital's eternal reproduction, we're still on the extraction  
**[0:16:56-0:16:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:16:56):**  paradigm.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:16:58):**  But if we are in a unity paradigm, in the paradigm of we're all interconnected, then  
**[0:17:04-0:17:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:17:04):**  I realize as an investor that my thriving life is codependent, absolutely codependent  
**[0:17:10-0:17:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:17:10):**  in your thriving life.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:17:12):**  Everyone is.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:17:13):**  Exactly.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:17:14):**  And the larger web of life.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:17:16):**  And I start being less human centric and more eco centric, more centric on life than on  
**[0:17:21-0:17:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:17:21):**  human life.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:17:23):**  So what I see is that there's an evolution of investors that are changing only the what  
**[0:17:29-0:17:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:17:29):**  they're investing in.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:17:30):**  Oh, I'm investing in different inputs of the soil.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:17:33):**  So now I'm regenerative.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:17:35):**  But then there's like, you know, deeper ones that are also changing the how.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:17:39):**  And do you see them going through that?  
**[0:17:41-0:17:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:17:41):**  Like do you see?  
**[0:17:42-0:17:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:17:42):**  Because I always wonder, like, I see people getting hooked on soil.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:17:46):**  And it sounds like a drug, but getting interested in the potential and seeing that and then  
**[0:17:52-0:17:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:17:52):**  usually slowly going deeper and deeper down this file and getting deeper in that holistic  
**[0:17:57-0:17:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:17:57):**  view.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:17:58):**  Do you see that's the same also happening with investors going further down the continuum,  
**[0:18:02-0:18:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:18:02):**  let's say towards regenerative?  
**[0:18:04-0:18:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:18:04):**  They start questioning more and more.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:18:06):**  Or do many get stuck and stay stuck for a long time?  
**[0:18:09-0:18:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:18:09):**  I think everyone's on a different transition and a different speed.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:18:13):**  And precisely because everyone has a different role and come from a different generation.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:18:18):**  And I think we're very contextual in that, you know, the human behavior is very contextual.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:18:23):**  You're very contextual to your time and your role and your context.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:18:27):**  Right.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:18:28):**  And I am too.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:18:29):**  I'm a consequence of the time that I'm leaving and the role that I'm playing or roles that  
**[0:18:33-0:18:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:18:33):**  I'm playing and the context that I'm living.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:18:35):**  I'm very Mexican, you know, and I'm very, but I'm a, I'm a Mexican ex banker.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:18:40):**  So it's a very different context than other Mexican.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:18:42):**  Right.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:18:43):**  So I think everyone has a limited perspective of the context that we're in.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:18:47):**  And I think many are more awake or ready to change than others.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:18:53):**  And precisely because it depends on what they have to lose or how much they need to shift  
**[0:18:58-0:19:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:18:58):**  paradigms and what has happened to us when we start education.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:19:03):**  Sometimes there's some investors that like from the first day of our education to the  
**[0:19:07-0:19:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:19:07):**  last, they have changed so much and so many paradigms shifts, but then there's some that  
**[0:19:13-0:19:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:19:13):**  takes some years and then they come back and they're like, now I'm ready.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:19:17):**  And it just happened actually this week, one investor that took our course in 2019, he  
**[0:19:23-0:19:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:19:23):**  did his first regenerative investment this week.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:19:26):**  So the, actually the deposit came yesterday and we were like super, super happy and it  
**[0:19:31-0:19:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:19:31):**  took him a while, but the very first time he looked for us, he came because he wanted  
**[0:19:35-0:19:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:19:35):**  to change his investments.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:19:37):**  And this was on 2019 and all these years, you know, he has been learning, he has been  
**[0:19:41-0:19:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:19:41):**  getting fermentation.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:19:43):**  Exactly.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:19:44):**  You know, the trust is the currency, you know, our currency is trust.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:19:48):**  And the more he trusts because he really went into studying very deeply and he got to know  
**[0:19:53-0:19:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:19:53):**  the Regenesis people and blah, blah, blah, and now he trusts and now he values differently.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:19:59):**  So now he moves, but that's just one case.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:20:01):**  There's many cases.  
**[0:20:03-0:20:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:20:03):**  So I think we are very radical, I would think in our education, precisely because we want  
**[0:20:08-0:20:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:20:08):**  people to live shifted.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:20:11):**  It doesn't matter how long they take to take action because that's depending on their times,  
**[0:20:16-0:20:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:20:16):**  but at least if they go through it, you know, they will be shifted somehow and they will  
**[0:20:21-0:20:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:20:21):**  feel questioned and they will question the deepest paradigms and they will question the  
**[0:20:26-0:20:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:20:26):**  purpose of capital and they will question how much their capital is being a manifestation  
**[0:20:31-0:20:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:20:31):**  of themselves.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:20:32):**  And just one example of this week, this is another family.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:20:36):**  This family was having a very social justice transformative policy, but they were calling  
**[0:20:42-0:20:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:20:42):**  it a Trojan horse for the bigger family's wealth.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:20:47):**  And I was saying, wait a minute, you know, the Trojan horse is a wire metaphor where  
**[0:20:53-0:20:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:20:53):**  you have an unfair advantage of the seat.  
**[0:20:56-0:21:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:20:56):**  So if you really want like the purpose of regeneration and you're like putting like  
**[0:21:02-0:21:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:21:02):**  a wire statement, like, you know, we think regeneration comes from within.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:21:08):**  And there's a beautiful Hindi wisdom phrase that is that if the egg breaks from the outside  
**[0:21:14-0:21:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:21:14):**  force, life ends, and if an egg breaks from the inside force, life begins.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:21:20):**  So anything that is good has to come inside out.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:21:23):**  I mean, there is something there with the Trojan horse that came from the inside, but  
**[0:21:26-0:21:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:21:26):**  yeah, no, I get the attention there, obviously.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:21:29):**  But it's very different to come from the inside to kill with an advantage of the seat than  
**[0:21:33-0:21:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:21:33):**  to come from the inside force for rebirth.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:21:36):**  And how did they change or did they change?  
**[0:21:39-0:21:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:21:39):**  What was their response to when you brought it up?  
**[0:21:41-0:21:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:21:41):**  Precisely.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:21:43):**  So that investment policy they accepted that had been written with some anger.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:21:48):**  And so basically they really made a reflection that perhaps this is the opportunity for rebirth.  
**[0:21:53-0:21:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:21:53):**  Perhaps this is the opportunity for a restart.  
**[0:21:56-0:22:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:21:56):**  And perhaps this regeneration that we want to do with the capital, it has to start within  
**[0:22:02-0:22:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:22:02):**  to a healing that is internal before we, you know, go and do healing outside.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:22:09):**  So I mean, that was just our reflection this week.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:22:12):**  Right.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:22:13):**  So it's those kinds of things that we have really gotten into in our education.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:22:18):**  So like very much about the questioning of the paradigms, where we're coming from in  
**[0:22:23-0:22:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:22:23):**  like the way that we're acting our investment thesis or investment selection or pipeline  
**[0:22:28-0:22:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:22:28):**  or term sheets, because if we're still coming in a paradigm of control, our term sheets  
**[0:22:33-0:22:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:22:33):**  will say so instead of like coming from a paradigm of liberation and a paradigm of love  
**[0:22:38-0:22:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:22:38):**  and a paradigm of regeneration for real, you know?  
**[0:22:42-0:22:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:22:42):**  So we try to be, maybe we're like combining very hippie stuff.  
**[0:22:46-0:22:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:22:46):**  Yeah.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:22:47):**  But then with coming from a banker or an ex banker, that's very interesting.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:22:50):**  And then so you're trying to shock in a good way or to have people go through those transformations  
**[0:22:57-0:22:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:22:57):**  by in their own speed and time.  
**[0:22:59-0:23:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:22:59):**  But then they come back to you and say, okay, now I'm ready to invest.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:23:02):**  You work as well, because then you say, we actually do some of these transactions.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:23:06):**  So what are the examples then that you are able to, if you have worked over the last  
**[0:23:11-0:23:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:23:11):**  period, that are regenerative investments open to people that are ready, let's say for  
**[0:23:15-0:23:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:23:15):**  them?  
**[0:23:16-0:23:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:23:16):**  Oh, well, there's been some lovely examples, but we act as advisors.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:23:21):**  So that is very important.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:23:22):**  We might take the plunge of going into management precisely at the end of this year, but right  
**[0:23:26-0:23:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:23:26):**  now we act as advisors only.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:23:28):**  So right now we're advising around $41 million.  
**[0:23:31-0:23:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:23:31):**  And the way we influence or advise has a limited, of course, responsibility to what they actually  
**[0:23:37-0:23:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:23:37):**  do.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:23:38):**  Right.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:23:39):**  So some of our investments are more regenerative than others, precisely because we can shift  
**[0:23:44-0:23:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:23:44):**  the paradigm as much as we want.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:23:47):**  But at the end, the ultimate responsibility of the capital allocation is not ours yet.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:23:52):**  So that's where I want to just be careful on, on like everything we want to do is inspire  
**[0:23:58-0:24:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:23:58):**  them into a regenerative process.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:24:00):**  But not every one of our investments are fully regenerative in my point of view.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:24:06):**  So one, for example, they like very much.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:24:08):**  I don't know if you've ever heard of Playa Viva.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:24:11):**  So the beauty about Playa Viva, it's in a beautiful state in Mexico.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:24:15):**  It's one of those states that is just magical and the natural capital and the biodiversity  
**[0:24:19-0:24:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:24:19):**  and the population, like everything there is magical.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:24:22):**  The thing is, it's a very conflictive state.  
**[0:24:25-0:24:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:24:25):**  And in conflictive, I mean, drug lords, drug cartels, like conflicted.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:24:30):**  Actually the name of the state in Mexico is called warrior Guerrero, but it has beautiful  
**[0:24:35-0:24:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:24:35):**  beaches.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:24:36):**  It's like, it's, it's paradise.  
**[0:24:37-0:24:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:24:37):**  Like really the beauty of the place is just amazing.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:24:39):**  It's very fertile soil, but it has its issues.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:24:44):**  So what's happening, there's so much migration from the communities that are, you know, most  
**[0:24:49-0:24:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:24:49):**  vulnerable precisely because of all this insecurity and Playa Viva came more than a decade ago  
**[0:24:55-0:24:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:24:55):**  and they started doing precisely the process with Regenesis.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:24:59):**  And they started seeing, you know, what if we see this land as a potential paradise?  
**[0:25:04-0:25:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:25:04):**  Because it is, it is a potential paradise.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:25:06):**  And now that I see it all regenerated and beautiful, of course you absolutely believe  
**[0:25:10-0:25:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:25:10):**  it from day one, but I can imagine a decade ago or more how it was when they first came  
**[0:25:17-0:25:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:25:17):**  in.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:25:18):**  And I think it was harder to imagine the paradise, but basically they started listening to the  
**[0:25:23-0:25:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:25:23):**  community.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:25:24):**  They started listening to, to like the history of place, like all of that deep engagement  
**[0:25:30-0:25:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:25:30):**  of place and to acknowledge that we are only stewards of a very short time period of place.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:25:36):**  And place has been around for, you know, millennia and like the deeper history of place.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:25:42):**  So basically they really listened, they really went in and they started doing this beautiful  
**[0:25:47-0:25:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:25:47):**  experience.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:25:48):**  So Playa Viva, it's a really pure experience when you go because it's a eco touristic hotel  
**[0:25:55-0:25:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:25:55):**  that it's really, really large.  
**[0:25:57-0:25:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:25:57):**  There's so many hectares.  
**[0:25:58-0:25:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:25:58):**  They have regenerated so much.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:25:59):**  It used to be a monoculture farm for coconut and tamarind.  
**[0:26:04-0:26:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:26:04):**  And now it has, you know, farm to table, not only for their hotels, but like the hotels  
**[0:26:08-0:26:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:26:08):**  in the surrounding areas, they have like deep engagement with the communities.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:26:12):**  There's a turtle sanctuary that they save in so many turtles and there's a mangrove  
**[0:26:17-0:26:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:26:17):**  regeneration of the Bay.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:26:19):**  And they're taking care of a lagoon that is for the fishermen right next to Playa Viva.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:26:23):**  And it's, it's an estuary.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:26:25):**  It's a Bay.  
**[0:26:26-0:26:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:26:26):**  It's so beautiful.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:26:27):**  Like I had never been in touch with a coastal regeneration until I went to Playa Viva.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:26:33):**  And it's, it's just too beautiful to imagine.  
**[0:26:37-0:26:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:26:37):**  And it's really simple and it's really humble.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:26:39):**  And the architecture, you know, it's, you're like really in open air, like there's no air  
**[0:26:44-0:26:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:26:44):**  conditioning or everything is solar panel powered.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:26:48):**  And it's just beautiful.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:26:49):**  You turn off the fan when there's rain and you get like the real breeze.  
**[0:26:55-0:26:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:26:55):**  So it's a very different experience for you.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:26:58):**  And I think it's very transformative that even as a consumer, you get to participate  
**[0:27:01-0:27:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:27:01):**  in that regeneration and you get to save the turtles and you get to go to the farm.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:27:06):**  So I think it's an all in one experience.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:27:09):**  And that's the investment that we closed this week, for example.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:27:13):**  So my question is going to be how, because I know the case a bit through Tonic, but how  
**[0:27:17-0:27:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:27:17):**  is that on the finance side also regenerative?  
**[0:27:21-0:27:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:27:21):**  Like what excites you beyond being an absolutely piece of paradise as it sounds like an absolute  
**[0:27:26-0:27:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:27:26):**  piece of paradise, but how does it differ from maybe other pieces of paradise that have  
**[0:27:31-0:27:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:27:31):**  been financed differently if you know, and if that's an interesting example from that  
**[0:27:35-0:27:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:27:35):**  point of view?  
**[0:27:36-0:27:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:27:36):**  Well, in that one, we haven't been able to recommend structures at all.  
**[0:27:40-0:27:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:27:40):**  It's just that it's just very benevolent debt.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:27:44):**  So in that one, we haven't been, you know, involved in the inside of the structure, but  
**[0:27:49-0:27:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:27:49):**  there is some possibilities in Playaviva, new possibilities of new projects that they  
**[0:27:53-0:27:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:27:53):**  are working on that I don't know if I can share yet.  
**[0:27:57-0:27:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:27:57):**  Let's not do it, but yeah, we should have them on.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:27:59):**  Yeah.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:28:00):**  Amazing.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:28:01):**  Definitely have them.  
**[0:28:02-0:28:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:28:02):**  David Leventhal is amazing and he has so much to share and very humbly.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:28:08):**  Very interesting.  
**[0:28:09-0:28:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:28:09):**  And also there, I think the investors from what I know have responded positively and  
**[0:28:13-0:28:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:28:13):**  have been investing in these kinds of structures and in this case, depth, but obviously in  
**[0:28:20-0:28:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:28:20):**  a challenging environment or in a very ambitious environment.  
**[0:28:24-0:28:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:28:24):**  And in terms of agriculture, I know you've been working also on some interesting aspects.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:28:28):**  What's been the most exciting because of course it's like choosing your babies, but what's  
**[0:28:33-0:28:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:28:33):**  been the most surprising one you've worked on in the past years where maybe regeneration  
**[0:28:38-0:28:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:28:38):**  also in the investment terms really came to flourish?  
**[0:28:41-0:28:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:28:41):**  There's two.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:28:42):**  So one that is right in front of me.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:28:43):**  So in Mexico, succulents are very popular right now and basically it's an ornamental  
**[0:28:48-0:28:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:28:48):**  plant, but it's part of the Mexican biodiversity.  
**[0:28:52-0:28:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:28:52):**  So this is a couple that work for the largest public university in Mexico, which is UNAM.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:28:59):**  And basically UNAM has a natural protected area of its own.  
**[0:29:02-0:29:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:29:02):**  Like the university is so, so big and that it has a natural protected area and that natural  
**[0:29:08-0:29:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:29:08):**  protected area had a botanical garden, but that botanical garden to be able to keep it  
**[0:29:13-0:29:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:29:13):**  up, it takes a lot of budget.  
**[0:29:15-0:29:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:29:15):**  And right now there's a lot of government cuts and so little budget that basically this  
**[0:29:20-0:29:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:29:20):**  couple had to start doing some research and investigation to use the plants of the Mexican  
**[0:29:26-0:29:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:29:26):**  biodiversity to be able to get the costs and increase the population of those plants.  
**[0:29:31-0:29:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:29:31):**  So basically this is endemic species of Mexico that is mostly cactus, but it's cactus in  
**[0:29:37-0:29:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:29:37):**  different ways.  
**[0:29:39-0:29:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:29:39):**  Like there's so many shapes, there's so many shapes and there's so many colors.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:29:43):**  There's purple ones, there's pink ones, there's ones with flowers, there's green ones.  
**[0:29:47-0:29:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:29:47):**  So basically it looks like a cactus and it has the same properties.  
**[0:29:53-0:29:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:29:53):**  So it is very good for arid environments and it stores a lot of water and they're very  
**[0:29:59-0:30:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:29:59):**  resilient.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:30:00):**  They're the most resilient plants you can imagine, but they're also very beautiful and  
**[0:30:04-0:30:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:30:04):**  they're low maintenance, right?  
**[0:30:06-0:30:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:30:06):**  So in terms of ornamental plants, in terms of like the plants that people are used to  
**[0:30:11-0:30:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:30:11):**  including in their decoration internally, they have been becoming trendier and trendier  
**[0:30:17-0:30:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:30:17):**  and not just in Mexico, but like all North America.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:30:19):**  So right now these guys, this couple is producing these plants all over Mexico.  
**[0:30:25-0:30:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:30:25):**  They have engaged more than 22 indigenous communities in several Mexican States and  
**[0:30:30-0:30:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:30:30):**  they're now exporting and they're now becoming really, really specialists in like how to  
**[0:30:36-0:30:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:30:36):**  make, for example, right now in the pandemic, we're all using that gel, what's the name,  
**[0:30:41-0:30:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:30:41):**  the sanitizer gel that everyone is using and it's really made of like so many things that  
**[0:30:46-0:30:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:30:46):**  are kind of toxic and these guys are doing like a bio sanitizer that is from the cactus.  
**[0:30:52-0:30:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:30:52):**  So like the Sabila from the cactus, that's the one that they're using.  
**[0:30:56-0:31:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:30:56):**  So it's a sanitizer that is very much way better for your skin and it's actually very  
**[0:31:01-0:31:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:31:01):**  good for your skin and it's actually very good for so many other things.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:31:05):**  And this helps, for example, if you get burned, you use that same one and it heals skin.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:31:11):**  So there are so many properties of these native biodiversity in Mexico that are not just ornamental.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:31:18):**  They are really good in terms of like natural pharmaceuticals, beauty, like so many things.  
**[0:31:25-0:31:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:31:25):**  And so these amazing couple have been engaging more and more and more producers and the beauty  
**[0:31:31-0:31:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:31:31):**  is that more than 60% of the earnings go directly to the producers, to the last mile producers.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:31:39):**  So for me, that has been really transformative.  
**[0:31:42-0:31:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:31:42):**  These guys are biologists, so they're not managers in origin.  
**[0:31:47-0:31:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:31:47):**  They're not business people, they're not driven by profit.  
**[0:31:51-0:31:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:31:51):**  They were really driven to how do we preserve the botanical garden?  
**[0:31:54-0:31:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:31:54):**  How do we preserve the native species?  
**[0:31:56-0:32:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:31:56):**  Like really, really their deeper soul and motivation is Mexican biodiversity.  
**[0:32:02-0:32:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:32:02):**  And that is why they have developed now three companies.  
**[0:32:05-0:32:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:32:05):**  They are exporting, they are selling marvelously.  
**[0:32:08-0:32:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:32:08):**  They have now a valuation of around $20 million.  
**[0:32:12-0:32:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:32:12):**  They're amazing, you know, and now they even sell the plant that paints the dollar green.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:32:17):**  So literally the US dollar, it gets painted green with a plant that they're selling, you  
**[0:32:23-0:32:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:32:23):**  know, so it's one of those things that I'm really enjoying working with them, getting  
**[0:32:27-0:32:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:32:27):**  to know them the way they think, you know, they are biologists at heart.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:32:32):**  So it's a very different kind of business, what a biologist builds.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:32:36):**  And it's just amazing.  
**[0:32:37-0:32:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:32:37):**  How does it manifest?  
**[0:32:38-0:32:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:32:38):**  What's the biggest difference or the most surprising difference?  
**[0:32:40-0:32:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:32:40):**  How a biologist builds a business?  
**[0:32:43-0:32:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:32:43):**  Well they're very scared of investors at first, for example, precisely because they don't  
**[0:32:48-0:32:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:32:48):**  want anyone to change their DNA.  
**[0:32:51-0:32:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:32:51):**  They don't want anyone to overdrive profit and to think about some pricing that could  
**[0:32:57-0:33:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:32:57):**  perhaps give less to the farmer suppliers or.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:33:01):**  So what do you say when you feel that from, because I see that with a lot of family businesses  
**[0:33:05-0:33:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:33:05):**  as well with a lot of businesses actually are very used and a lot of farmers are very  
**[0:33:09-0:33:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:33:09):**  used to the only interaction with the financial world is the bank and usually not an amazing  
**[0:33:15-0:33:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:33:15):**  relationship.  
**[0:33:16-0:33:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:33:16):**  And so when you start talking about there is a whole other world out there of investors  
**[0:33:21-0:33:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:33:21):**  looking to put money to work in a very different way, the first reaction is usually very skeptical.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:33:26):**  So how do you respond to that?  
**[0:33:28-0:33:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:33:28):**  Totally.  
**[0:33:29-0:33:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:33:29):**  So and rightfully so.  
**[0:33:30-0:33:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:33:30):**  I'm not saying it's wrong, but.  
**[0:33:32-0:33:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:33:32):**  No, that's why we, for example, when we're helping them or advising their investment  
**[0:33:37-0:33:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:33:37):**  round or something, we're like never pointing towards, oh, so many investors that we're  
**[0:33:42-0:33:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:33:42):**  going to introduce you to hundreds of investors.  
**[0:33:44-0:33:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:33:44):**  Never like that.  
**[0:33:45-0:33:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:33:45):**  Like it's always few investors.  
**[0:33:46-0:33:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:33:46):**  It's always like five at most.  
**[0:33:49-0:33:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:33:49):**  It's always a very targeted approach.  
**[0:33:51-0:33:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:33:51):**  And most importantly, the investors that we have cultivated ourselves precisely because  
**[0:33:57-0:34:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:33:57):**  those are the ones we trust the most and precisely because we think that those will be the most  
**[0:34:02-0:34:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:34:02):**  aligned.  
**[0:34:04-0:34:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:34:04):**  And what I mean by that is that we try to have multi stakeholders.  
**[0:34:10-0:34:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:34:10):**  We try to not only cultivate investors, but also entrepreneurs and other type of stakeholders  
**[0:34:14-0:34:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:34:14):**  that we need.  
**[0:34:16-0:34:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:34:16):**  And when I mean cultivate, I mean infuse them with a different paradigm precisely because  
**[0:34:22-0:34:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:34:22):**  we want them to be in a very understanding point.  
**[0:34:26-0:34:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:34:26):**  And one day we divided the group and we said, OK, what if we do one week with only entrepreneurs  
**[0:34:32-0:34:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:34:32):**  and one week with only investors and then we make them meet?  
**[0:34:35-0:34:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:34:35):**  And the transactions happen really quickly, like in less than four months, there were  
**[0:34:39-0:34:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:34:39):**  six transactions.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:34:41):**  And it was precisely because, you know, we had given them both the same vocabulary, the  
**[0:34:46-0:34:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:34:46):**  same paradigms, everything that when they met, they were already speaking on the same  
**[0:34:51-0:34:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:34:51):**  terms.  
**[0:34:52-0:34:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:34:52):**  And I think that's what gave the fluidity of the relationship.  
**[0:34:55-0:35:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:34:55):**  And precisely because they had trusted us and we were like the trusted partner for both.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:35:00):**  And that was what really helped.  
**[0:35:03-0:35:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:35:03):**  So I think of myself sometimes as butter.  
**[0:35:06-0:35:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:35:06):**  Explain you know how you use butter right in recipes.  
**[0:35:11-0:35:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:35:11):**  Maybe butter is not the key ingredient because, you know, the most important players here  
**[0:35:15-0:35:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:35:15):**  are the entrepreneurs and the and the investors.  
**[0:35:17-0:35:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:35:17):**  You know, those are the key ingredients.  
**[0:35:19-0:35:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:35:19):**  But butter makes it work.  
**[0:35:21-0:35:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:35:21):**  And butter makes it not stick.  
**[0:35:23-0:35:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:35:23):**  And butter gives the lubrication, you know, that it needs.  
**[0:35:27-0:35:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:35:27):**  So for me, I believe like we in the culture of SBX, we apply the butter quality everywhere  
**[0:35:35-0:35:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:35:35):**  and always like a translation quality and a service, you know, always been in service  
**[0:35:40-0:35:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:35:40):**  of both.  
**[0:35:42-0:35:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:35:42):**  So we need to disclose that because are you working, you know, on this like on behalf  
**[0:35:46-0:35:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:35:46):**  of the investor?  
**[0:35:47-0:35:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:35:47):**  Are you working on behalf of the entrepreneur?  
**[0:35:49-0:35:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:35:49):**  And we say we're working on behalf of regeneration.  
**[0:35:53-0:35:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:35:53):**  And it's really clear that they know who's paying who and absolute transparency there  
**[0:35:58-0:36:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:35:58):**  so that everyone knows, you know, what's really going on in a transaction, but also to trust  
**[0:36:04-0:36:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:36:04):**  the transaction in a different way.  
**[0:36:06-0:36:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:36:06):**  So we're radically transparent.  
**[0:36:09-0:36:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:36:09):**  We're radically collaborative.  
**[0:36:11-0:36:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:36:11):**  And we really, you know, we learn a lot from butter and from soil.  
**[0:36:16-0:36:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:36:16):**  Super interesting.  
**[0:36:17-0:36:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:36:17):**  And with this view you've had over the last years and of course, not training, educating,  
**[0:36:23-0:36:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:36:23):**  and inspiring and nudging these investors and also the entrepreneurs.  
**[0:36:28-0:36:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:36:28):**  What do you see as most neglected in Mexico as in general, I think in the impact investing  
**[0:36:34-0:36:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:36:34):**  space, but let's look at the regeneration space.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:36:36):**  What do you would love that more people would work on to really make the regeneration space  
**[0:36:41-0:36:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:36:41):**  bloom as it could and should because it sounds like I've never been, but it sounds like the  
**[0:36:46-0:36:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:36:46):**  ideal place because of a lot of opportunities and a lot of issues.  
**[0:36:50-0:36:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:36:50):**  And obviously climate change is hitting very hard, but at the same time you have a biodiversity  
**[0:36:54-0:36:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:36:54):**  rich and incredible biodiversity rich place.  
**[0:36:58-0:37:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:36:58):**  What do you see as the most neglected piece of the puzzle?  
**[0:37:00-0:37:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:37:00):**  I would really love the finance people to be seduced by Mexico's biological wealth and  
**[0:37:06-0:37:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:37:06):**  actually Latin Americans biological wealth.  
**[0:37:09-0:37:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:37:09):**  And what I mean by that is that right now all Latin America is very seduced by Silicon  
**[0:37:15-0:37:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:37:15):**  Valley and is very in love with tech centricity and that's dangerous because this is not Silicon  
**[0:37:22-0:37:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:37:22):**  Valley at all.  
**[0:37:23-0:37:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:37:23):**  And the way that Silicon Valley flows is very different from how Latin America flows and  
**[0:37:29-0:37:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:37:29):**  the level of, for example, in the global North you have the business driven transactions  
**[0:37:34-0:37:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:37:34):**  come from a cognitive trust and in Latin America they come mostly from an affective trust,  
**[0:37:41-0:37:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:37:41):**  from being friends of your friends and people who know.  
**[0:37:43-0:37:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:37:43):**  And you know, there's some level of affective trust in the global North as well, but in  
**[0:37:47-0:37:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:37:47):**  Latin America it's very different.  
**[0:37:49-0:37:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:37:49):**  So what I see is that the, the finance people right now are very much in love with the Silicon  
**[0:37:56-0:38:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:37:56):**  Valley model and they are like revering technology and they have become blind to like the biological  
**[0:38:04-0:38:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:38:04):**  wealth of Latin America.  
**[0:38:06-0:38:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:38:06):**  We have more than a third of the world's biodiversity and we could be the answer to so many of the  
**[0:38:13-0:38:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:38:13):**  climate problems and we could be, you know, Latin America could be the potential solution  
**[0:38:17-0:38:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:38:17):**  of like half of the, half of the problem, you know?  
**[0:38:22-0:38:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:38:22):**  And like really, I don't see people valuing that.  
**[0:38:25-0:38:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:38:25):**  They want Peru to be the new Silicon Valley.  
**[0:38:27-0:38:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:38:27):**  They want Mexico to be the new Silicon Valley instead of, you know, seeing, no, we have  
**[0:38:32-0:38:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:38:32):**  so much here.  
**[0:38:33-0:38:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:38:33):**  You know, you have this beauty, you have some of the happiest countries in the world and  
**[0:38:37-0:38:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:38:37):**  there's a reason for that.  
**[0:38:39-0:38:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:38:39):**  You know, there's a reason for us to be happy because we have a model that even though we're  
**[0:38:44-0:38:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:38:44):**  not very rich and even though we lack so many services and even though there's always messy  
**[0:38:49-0:38:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:38:49):**  stuff going with the corruption and the insecurity and all of that, all throughout Latin America,  
**[0:38:56-0:38:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:38:56):**  even with all of that, you have some of the happiest population.  
**[0:38:59-0:39:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:38:59):**  And why is that?  
**[0:39:00-0:39:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:39:00):**  And you know, behavioral scientists have come here and have seen that it's usually because  
**[0:39:04-0:39:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:39:04):**  of companionship, of friendship and of love.  
**[0:39:07-0:39:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:39:07):**  Like those are the real pieces of fundamental things that make us happy and not, you know,  
**[0:39:15-0:39:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:39:15):**  the access to services or income.  
**[0:39:17-0:39:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:39:17):**  So what we have is so precious and so valuable that we should be exporting it instead of  
**[0:39:24-0:39:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:39:24):**  importing all those unhappiness paradigms that we don't really need.  
**[0:39:29-0:39:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:39:29):**  So why do you think that these local financiers and investors get so interested in the shininess  
**[0:39:36-0:39:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:39:36):**  of Silicon Valley or of New York or of London or whatever?  
**[0:39:40-0:39:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:39:40):**  What's the, because they've grown up, I'm assuming in Latin America, in Mexico, and  
**[0:39:45-0:39:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:39:45):**  they know, or they should know what is possible, but yet they get very, very interested in  
**[0:39:51-0:39:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:39:51):**  shiny objects, meaning whatever rounds, very short term funds focused on software, et cetera,  
**[0:39:57-0:39:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:39:57):**  et cetera.  
**[0:39:58-0:39:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:39:58):**  Totally.  
**[0:39:59-0:40:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:39:59):**  I think it's also because the highly educated people in Latin America also educate themselves  
**[0:40:04-0:40:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:40:04):**  in the global North.  
**[0:40:05-0:40:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:40:05):**  They go to many of these universities, you know, they, I mean, I did an exchange as well.  
**[0:40:11-0:40:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:40:11):**  And there's so many people that to consider yourself highly educated, you need to look  
**[0:40:15-0:40:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:40:15):**  to the global North.  
**[0:40:16-0:40:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:40:16):**  And basically that's a paradigm right now that, that unfortunately it's real and it's  
**[0:40:20-0:40:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:40:20):**  happening.  
**[0:40:21-0:40:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:40:21):**  So people look up to the global North and whatever's happening there and they consider  
**[0:40:25-0:40:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:40:25):**  it or value it more highly than whatever's going on locally.  
**[0:40:29-0:40:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:40:29):**  And that is a, you know, that's why I continuously say we need to reindigenize finance and  
**[0:40:35-0:40:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:40:35):**  reindigenize ourselves because everyone, we're all indigenous to earth.  
**[0:40:40-0:40:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:40:40):**  The thing is we have perhaps not value it as such precisely because right now the money  
**[0:40:45-0:40:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:40:45):**  paradigm money can come from anywhere and go everywhere.  
**[0:40:48-0:40:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:40:48):**  And when, you know, when they get bored of this, they go to another thing and they don't  
**[0:40:52-0:40:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:40:52):**  have roots.  
**[0:40:53-0:40:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:40:53):**  And that's precisely what's degrading ecosystems.  
**[0:40:56-0:41:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:40:56):**  Like for example, here in Mexico, the land for industrial agriculture, it's rented and  
**[0:41:02-0:41:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:41:02):**  it's rented precisely because they know for a fact that they will be degrading that land  
**[0:41:07-0:41:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:41:07):**  and in 10 years time, you know, it won't be able to grow anything and they will move.  
**[0:41:12-0:41:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:41:12):**  So that's something that makes you not be rooted.  
**[0:41:15-0:41:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:41:15):**  It comes back to the owning piece you mentioned before.  
**[0:41:18-0:41:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:41:18):**  And it comes back to the longevity of your decisions.  
**[0:41:20-0:41:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:41:20):**  Like if you're a long-term decision maker for that piece of land versus when you're  
**[0:41:24-0:41:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:41:24):**  a short-term decision maker for that land.  
**[0:41:26-0:41:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:41:26):**  So I think if the money paradigm is to be sector driven instead of place driven, it  
**[0:41:33-0:41:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:41:33):**  will degrade natural capital by default.  
**[0:41:36-0:41:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:41:36):**  And in the other case, if we make money be place-based and decisions be longer term,  
**[0:41:43-0:41:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:41:43):**  then we become rooted to place and we care and we care about, you know, what our decisions  
**[0:41:48-0:41:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:41:48):**  today might affect the rivers of tomorrow and the air of tomorrow that we will breathe  
**[0:41:53-0:41:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:41:53):**  tomorrow or our children will breathe.  
**[0:41:55-0:42:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:41:55):**  So I think the re-indigenizing process is really important because it roots us to place  
**[0:42:01-0:42:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:42:01):**  and that is something that all finance needs.  
**[0:42:04-0:42:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:42:04):**  Like finance needs to become less sector driven, more place driven, because that's the only  
**[0:42:09-0:42:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:42:09):**  way we will actually see what we're degrading or regenerating.  
**[0:42:14-0:42:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:42:14):**  If you're not rooted in place, you don't see that.  
**[0:42:17-0:42:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:42:17):**  Everything is abstract.  
**[0:42:18-0:42:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:42:18):**  Everything is in a statement or an Excel spreadsheet and that's not visible.  
**[0:42:23-0:42:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:42:23):**  That's not concrete.  
**[0:42:24-0:42:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:42:24):**  And would that be your advice, obviously without giving investment advice, but imagine there's  
**[0:42:29-0:42:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:42:29):**  a theater of investors, smart investors listening to this and get really excited.  
**[0:42:34-0:42:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:42:34):**  What would be your advice to them as a next step without giving financial or investment  
**[0:42:38-0:42:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:42:38):**  advice?  
**[0:42:39-0:42:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:42:39):**  Would that be to find those roots and to go deeper into place wherever they find themselves  
**[0:42:44-0:42:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:42:44):**  or wherever they feel themselves drawn to?  
**[0:42:46-0:42:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:42:46):**  Or would it be something else?  
**[0:42:48-0:42:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:42:48):**  This might sound very hippy, but I believe everyone must fall in love with place and  
**[0:42:56-0:43:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:42:56):**  finance must fall in love with life and literally fall in love.  
**[0:43:00-0:43:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:43:00):**  And what I mean fall in love is that when you love somebody, you care, you ask, you're  
**[0:43:06-0:43:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:43:06):**  curious, you listen, you share.  
**[0:43:08-0:43:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:43:08):**  It's like anything that comes from the love paradigm.  
**[0:43:12-0:43:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:43:12):**  I really like Daniel Christian Wall, he writes so much about regeneration and there's a question  
**[0:43:19-0:43:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:43:19):**  he asks about what is so worth sustaining about humanity?  
**[0:43:24-0:43:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:43:24):**  Why do we want to sustain humanity?  
**[0:43:26-0:43:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:43:26):**  And of course, any answer that you come up with, it's always down to, it comes down to  
**[0:43:31-0:43:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:43:31):**  love.  
**[0:43:32-0:43:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:43:32):**  Anything worth sustaining in this planet is love.  
**[0:43:35-0:43:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:43:35):**  And if we start doing our financial decisions really from a place of love, it's very, very  
**[0:43:42-0:43:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:43:42):**  different than from a place of fear.  
**[0:43:44-0:43:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:43:44):**  From a place of fear, you start controlling and you want to control everything because  
**[0:43:48-0:43:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:43:48):**  you fear everyone and you fear everything.  
**[0:43:51-0:43:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:43:51):**  And from a place of love, it's very different.  
**[0:43:53-0:43:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:43:53):**  And you start with the trust qualities and you start trusting and you start letting go  
**[0:43:59-0:44:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:43:59):**  and you start liberating yourself as well as others.  
**[0:44:03-0:44:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:44:03):**  So I believe that my advice is that if you fall in love with place, you start being curious  
**[0:44:09-0:44:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:44:09):**  about it.  
**[0:44:10-0:44:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:44:10):**  You start listening to it.  
**[0:44:11-0:44:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:44:11):**  You start seeing it.  
**[0:44:12-0:44:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:44:12):**  You start caring.  
**[0:44:14-0:44:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:44:14):**  You hurt when you see a tree taken down for construction.  
**[0:44:18-0:44:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:44:18):**  You hurt when you see a river changing direction because of a developer.  
**[0:44:24-0:44:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:44:24):**  You start hurting for real and you start caring for real and you start being a steward for  
**[0:44:29-0:44:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:44:29):**  real of place.  
**[0:44:31-0:44:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:44:31):**  That is the way I think of re-indigenization, like the rooting of us in place, the falling  
**[0:44:37-0:44:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:44:37):**  in love with place so that we can care that much, that we can listen that deep, that we  
**[0:44:43-0:44:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:44:43):**  can act that far.  
**[0:44:46-0:44:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:44:46):**  And that way, capital would really be at the service instead of being like the dominant  
**[0:44:51-0:44:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:44:51):**  party.  
**[0:44:52-0:44:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:44:52):**  I think that's what's needed, not just in Mexico, everywhere.  
**[0:44:55-0:44:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:44:55):**  It's beautiful advice.  
**[0:44:56-0:45:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:44:56):**  And I'm going to ask you maybe a tricky or difficult question, but what if overnight  
**[0:45:00-0:45:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:45:00):**  you'd be in charge of quite a large investment portfolio?  
**[0:45:03-0:45:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:45:03):**  So somehow you get a phone call and from tomorrow morning onwards, you are the fund manager  
**[0:45:09-0:45:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:45:09):**  of, let's say, a billion dollars, which is still quite a lot of money.  
**[0:45:12-0:45:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:45:12):**  I mean, this is in Corona times.  
**[0:45:14-0:45:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:45:14):**  Let's say the billions have been flying around.  
**[0:45:16-0:45:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:45:16):**  So it could be 10 billion, but let's say a lot of money.  
**[0:45:19-0:45:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:45:19):**  What would be your first steps?  
**[0:45:20-0:45:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:45:20):**  I'm interested not in the exact dollar amount.  
**[0:45:23-0:45:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:45:23):**  I'm interested in where would you prioritize?  
**[0:45:25-0:45:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:45:25):**  What would you look at first if you had to put it to work?  
**[0:45:27-0:45:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:45:27):**  Let's say the duration of the fund is absolutely could be evergreen, doesn't, but it has to  
**[0:45:32-0:45:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:45:32):**  be investments, not necessarily grants.  
**[0:45:34-0:45:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:45:34):**  Yeah, I love evergreen.  
**[0:45:36-0:45:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:45:36):**  So of course I shift to where I know most, which is Latin America.  
**[0:45:41-0:45:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:45:41):**  We have worked in Mexico, in Colombia, in Chile, in Peru.  
**[0:45:45-0:45:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:45:45):**  Right now we're very active in Peru and in Central America.  
**[0:45:48-0:45:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:45:48):**  So of course, since the one that I know the most is Latin America, I would of course start  
**[0:45:52-0:45:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:45:52):**  in Latin America.  
**[0:45:53-0:45:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:45:53):**  I think there's priority ecosystems right now and not just for the potential that they  
**[0:45:59-0:46:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:45:59):**  have of mitigation and adaptation to climate change, but also for the potential regeneration  
**[0:46:04-0:46:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:46:04):**  like globally, you know, there's so much that Latin America can do for that, as I mentioned  
**[0:46:09-0:46:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:46:09):**  earlier.  
**[0:46:10-0:46:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:46:10):**  So I think most of my investment thesis would be to go directly with the indigenous communities  
**[0:46:17-0:46:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:46:17):**  that have been the best stewards of these ecosystems and co-create with them the investment  
**[0:46:23-0:46:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:46:23):**  thesis.  
**[0:46:24-0:46:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:46:24):**  I believe, you know, they know much more, they know way better and they have been there  
**[0:46:28-0:46:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:46:28):**  for the longest.  
**[0:46:30-0:46:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:46:30):**  And I believe they are really the regenerators today.  
**[0:46:34-0:46:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:46:34):**  And I definitely think they're seriously underfunded, but I also think the way the funding is coming  
**[0:46:40-0:46:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:46:40):**  is usually benefiting more roads, more infrastructure, you know, more gray, precisely because that's  
**[0:46:48-0:46:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:46:48):**  what the Black Rocks value.  
**[0:46:50-0:46:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:46:50):**  You know, those are the private equities way of doing things.  
**[0:46:54-0:46:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:46:54):**  And I want the indigenous way of doing things.  
**[0:46:56-0:46:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:46:56):**  I like the Buen Vivir Fund.  
**[0:46:58-0:46:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:46:58):**  I don't know if you know them.  
**[0:46:59-0:47:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:46:59):**  I like, you know, the cooperative funds, the ones that act as a cooperative, precisely  
**[0:47:04-0:47:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:47:04):**  because they share risk and they share benefits and they share everything.  
**[0:47:10-0:47:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:47:10):**  And I want to be co-partnering, I want to be partners with these indigenous communities.  
**[0:47:14-0:47:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:47:14):**  I wouldn't want them to be beneficiaries.  
**[0:47:17-0:47:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:47:17):**  So that's where I would go.  
**[0:47:19-0:47:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:47:19):**  And I'm sorry, but we take away your fund for a moment, but you have a magic power and  
**[0:47:24-0:47:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:47:24):**  you can change one thing in the food and agriculture or even land use sector, but also see, as  
**[0:47:29-0:47:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:47:29):**  you mentioned before, Earth, Playa Viva.  
**[0:47:31-0:47:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:47:31):**  And what would be your one thing you would change overnight?  
**[0:47:35-0:47:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:47:35):**  Agrochemicals.  
**[0:47:36-0:47:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:47:36):**  Agrochemicals, for sure.  
**[0:47:39-0:47:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:47:39):**  It's interesting.  
**[0:47:41-0:47:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:47:41):**  It's the second time, I think, in a few days, somebody brings it up in an interview.  
**[0:47:44-0:47:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:47:44):**  You would basically ban them overnight or make them disappear.  
**[0:47:49-0:47:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:47:49):**  I'm very active in working on the transition.  
**[0:47:53-0:47:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:47:53):**  I believe, you know, because of food sovereignty reasons and because of so many things, there  
**[0:47:58-0:48:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:47:58):**  are so many things at play.  
**[0:48:00-0:48:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:48:00):**  But in Mexico, at least, it has become kind of a cartel.  
**[0:48:04-0:48:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:48:04):**  You know, sometimes you're like experimenting in a plot and there's a pilot and they're  
**[0:48:08-0:48:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:48:08):**  putting, you know, the bio-fertilizers, the ones that are not fossil fuels, and somebody  
**[0:48:14-0:48:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:48:14):**  comes and like poisons it so that you look bad precisely and that your crop yield will  
**[0:48:20-0:48:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:48:20):**  not get to the point of success on purpose.  
**[0:48:23-0:48:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:48:23):**  So right now it is really, really toxic, not just in the chemicals themselves, but like  
**[0:48:29-0:48:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:48:29):**  the way they're operating is dangerous, like truly dangerous.  
**[0:48:34-0:48:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:48:34):**  And the last secretary of environment in the Mexican government was fired because he had,  
**[0:48:40-0:48:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:48:40):**  you know, said something against agrochemicals that was too radical.  
**[0:48:44-0:48:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:48:44):**  And in his house, he got like basically covered his house with agrochemicals one night.  
**[0:48:50-0:48:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:48:50):**  And he had to resign.  
**[0:48:51-0:48:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:48:51):**  So it has become very dangerous.  
**[0:48:53-0:48:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:48:53):**  Simply because there's too much money going on or because they feel the pressure?  
**[0:48:57-0:48:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:48:57):**  What do you see?  
**[0:48:58-0:49:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:48:58):**  Are there subsidies involved?  
**[0:49:00-0:49:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:49:00):**  Because there's subsidies, there's government relations.  
**[0:49:04-0:49:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:49:04):**  There's so many things, but there's basically regulations in Mexico are very, very soft  
**[0:49:11-0:49:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:49:11):**  and vague and optional.  
**[0:49:14-0:49:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:49:14):**  And the ones that are allowed are too many.  
**[0:49:16-0:49:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:49:16):**  And precisely when Europe bans something, Mexico and Latin America take decades to ban  
**[0:49:22-0:49:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:49:22):**  it.  
**[0:49:23-0:49:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:49:23):**  So it's like, it's considered poisonous and cancerous and everything in the global north  
**[0:49:26-0:49:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:49:26):**  and in the global south, we're still like receiving it because they still want to make  
**[0:49:30-0:49:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:49:30):**  it and they want to produce it and they want to get rid of it and they get rid of it in  
**[0:49:33-0:49:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:49:33):**  the global south.  
**[0:49:34-0:49:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:49:34):**  So you know, we get things that are like very toxic, very poisonous.  
**[0:49:39-0:49:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:49:39):**  There's you know, the city where my husband comes from is one of the highest in in in leukemia.  
**[0:49:44-0:49:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:49:44):**  And it's precisely one of the most agrochemical intensive states in Mexico.  
**[0:49:48-0:49:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:49:48):**  And it's the one that exports the most to the US.  
**[0:49:51-0:49:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:49:51):**  So you know, there's an absolute correlation.  
**[0:49:54-0:50:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:49:54):**  And do you see that the consumers as we're seeing now in I can only speak for part of  
**[0:50:00-0:50:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:50:00):**  the global north, but there is a lot of discussion now on agrochemicals.  
**[0:50:04-0:50:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:50:04):**  There's a lot of research coming out, which was already there, but somehow through the  
**[0:50:08-0:50:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:50:08):**  Zach Bush's and through French research, etc. suddenly we're looking differently at some  
**[0:50:12-0:50:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:50:12):**  of these.  
**[0:50:13-0:50:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:50:13):**  So do you see for the first time, I think even in the organic movement, we've never  
**[0:50:16-0:50:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:50:16):**  seen that you see actually consumers getting at least worried.  
**[0:50:22-0:50:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:50:22):**  And there's discussion on banning certain things at scale at state level or even country  
**[0:50:26-0:50:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:50:26):**  level.  
**[0:50:27-0:50:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:50:27):**  And you see the actions of some of these companies getting more desperate, which is usually a  
**[0:50:31-0:50:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:50:31):**  good sign because it means that they're in trouble.  
**[0:50:32-0:50:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:50:32):**  Do you see any of the consumer worrisome of that?  
**[0:50:36-0:50:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:50:36):**  This is a health crisis in Latin America or not yet?  
**[0:50:39-0:50:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:50:39):**  Of course, no, no, there's so much.  
**[0:50:41-0:50:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:50:41):**  There's so much going on.  
**[0:50:42-0:50:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:50:42):**  There's so much activism.  
**[0:50:43-0:50:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:50:43):**  The thing is, how can you fight such a huge system, you know, from wherever you are?  
**[0:50:50-0:50:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:50:50):**  And I really love and admire a woman entrepreneur.  
**[0:50:53-0:50:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:50:53):**  Her name is Adriana Luna.  
**[0:50:54-0:50:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:50:54):**  I was just talking to her yesterday.  
**[0:50:56-0:51:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:50:56):**  Adriana Luna, her company is called Tierra de Monte.  
**[0:51:00-0:51:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:51:00):**  And basically she used to work for those agrochemical companies.  
**[0:51:03-0:51:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:51:03):**  She and her husband are scientists and they used to work for them.  
**[0:51:07-0:51:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:51:07):**  And their daughter was born with like all of these allergies and stuff about agrochemicals.  
**[0:51:12-0:51:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:51:12):**  And they started feeding her like everything organic and everything.  
**[0:51:14-0:51:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:51:14):**  So they quit their profession because they started realizing the absolute correlations.  
**[0:51:20-0:51:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:51:20):**  And now they started this new company and everything is, you know, without fossil fuels.  
**[0:51:23-0:51:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:51:23):**  And they're like really, really being activists in like the change and the shift of inputs  
**[0:51:28-0:51:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:51:28):**  for agriculture in the whole of Mexico.  
**[0:51:31-0:51:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:51:31):**  But in a very, how would I say, like expert science driven way that they are amazing and  
**[0:51:37-0:51:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:51:37):**  they have a big heart.  
**[0:51:39-0:51:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:51:39):**  She just won the Cartier award, the Cartier woman award last year.  
**[0:51:44-0:51:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:51:44):**  Yeah.  
**[0:51:45-0:51:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:51:45):**  She's been very recognized, but still like her everyday work is still very hard precisely  
**[0:51:50-0:51:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:51:50):**  because of like everything I've been saying.  
**[0:51:52-0:51:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:51:52):**  What brings me hope is that right now, you know, the Paris agreement that we had all  
**[0:51:57-0:52:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:51:57):**  this, you know, agreement about temperature and now they're coming, the summit that is  
**[0:52:02-0:52:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:52:02):**  coming in China for the CBD, the convention for biodiversity.  
**[0:52:07-0:52:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:52:07):**  I am hoping that will be, you know, before and after that summit.  
**[0:52:12-0:52:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:52:12):**  And what I really like is that in the first draft, the first thing they said was two thirds  
**[0:52:17-0:52:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:52:17):**  of agrochemicals needs to go.  
**[0:52:19-0:52:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:52:19):**  And even though we could be more radical and worldwide life fund is like saying that that's  
**[0:52:24-0:52:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:52:24):**  not enough and that we need to blah, blah, blah.  
**[0:52:26-0:52:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:52:26):**  But at least the first draft, the fact that it's there, the fact that it's there, I'm  
**[0:52:30-0:52:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:52:30):**  like, wow, this is amazing.  
**[0:52:32-0:52:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:52:32):**  This is so important.  
**[0:52:33-0:52:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:52:33):**  This is key.  
**[0:52:34-0:52:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:52:34):**  And I am worried that many ESG funds include so many agrochemical companies that for me,  
**[0:52:41-0:52:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:52:41):**  this is a discussion that we have waited too long.  
**[0:52:44-0:52:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:52:44):**  And if it's so clear that fossil fuels are like, let's say kind of an enemy in terms  
**[0:52:48-0:52:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:52:48):**  of climate change, where can we start the conversation as soon as possible about agrochemicals?  
**[0:52:55-0:52:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:52:55):**  Because they also come from fossil fuels and they're super urgent.  
**[0:52:58-0:52:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:52:58):**  And it's one of the thresholds.  
**[0:52:59-0:53:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:52:59):**  They do a lot of damage.  
**[0:53:01-0:53:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:53:01):**  Exactly.  
**[0:53:02-0:53:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:53:02):**  And the planetary boundaries is one of the thresholds that we have crossed the farthest.  
**[0:53:05-0:53:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:53:05):**  Like it's super violated threshold, the one of agrochemicals and in Mexico, our most hot  
**[0:53:11-0:53:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:53:11):**  tourist spot, which is Cancun, it's completely filled with Sargassum.  
**[0:53:16-0:53:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:53:16):**  And it's supposedly there's a correlation of too much fertilizer going into the sea  
**[0:53:20-0:53:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:53:20):**  that is making the algae bloom so much that it out trafficates or suffocates the life  
**[0:53:26-0:53:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:53:26):**  underneath.  
**[0:53:27-0:53:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:53:27):**  And they become basically like all our beautiful beaches.  
**[0:53:31-0:53:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:53:31):**  The ones that were like the Mexican paradise that everyone came for are right now, like  
**[0:53:35-0:53:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:53:35):**  suffocated with Sargassum and it smells horrible.  
**[0:53:39-0:53:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:53:39):**  And it's been like that for years now.  
**[0:53:42-0:53:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:53:42):**  And it's all because of agrochemicals being dumped into the Mexican Gulf.  
**[0:53:46-0:53:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:53:46):**  So it's the runoffs.  
**[0:53:48-0:53:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:53:48):**  It's something that needs to stop yesterday.  
**[0:53:51-0:53:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:53:51):**  And we can talk about for hours about this with a discussion.  
**[0:53:55-0:53:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:53:55):**  It's not out yet, I think.  
**[0:53:56-0:54:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:53:56):**  But the subsidies going into that, the schemes are fascinating and potentially have a lever  
**[0:54:03-0:54:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:54:03):**  there actually to turn some of those subsidies into transition finance or ways to transition  
**[0:54:09-0:54:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:54:09):**  many farmers.  
**[0:54:10-0:54:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:54:10):**  But I want to be conscious of your time as well.  
**[0:54:11-0:54:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:54:11):**  And I don't think it's the last time we talked, but end with a final question inspired by  
**[0:54:15-0:54:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:54:15):**  John Kempf.  
**[0:54:16-0:54:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:54:16):**  Where are you contrarian?  
**[0:54:17-0:54:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:54:17):**  What do you believe to be true about the agenda of agriculture that others don't?  
**[0:54:20-0:54:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:54:20):**  I believe that right now, the regenerative agriculture movement is not necessarily placing  
**[0:54:26-0:54:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:54:26):**  as much voice in indigenous communities as we should.  
**[0:54:30-0:54:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:54:30):**  Like the voice that are speaking about regenerative agriculture globally are not all indigenous  
**[0:54:35-0:54:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:54:35):**  voices.  
**[0:54:36-0:54:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:54:36):**  Most of them are not.  
**[0:54:37-0:54:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:54:37):**  And they're the ones who know the most and who have been the stewards for the longest.  
**[0:54:41-0:54:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:54:41):**  And I have learned so much by going to the fields in Mexico.  
**[0:54:44-0:54:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:54:44):**  There's one person in Michoacán, he's indigenous Tlaxcaltecan.  
**[0:54:50-0:54:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:54:50):**  And he has taught me so much.  
**[0:54:52-0:54:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:54:52):**  And he doesn't have one eye precisely because he lost it to agrochemicals.  
**[0:54:57-0:55:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:54:57):**  And he can tell you with so much wisdom about like the fact that the land where he is cultivating,  
**[0:55:04-0:55:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:55:04):**  it is called Mazahua land and Mazahua is indigenous for the stewards of corn.  
**[0:55:10-0:55:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:55:10):**  And he says every tortilla that you eat here is a conversation with our ancestors because  
**[0:55:16-0:55:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:55:16):**  we have been taking care of these seeds for so many generations that the seed that you  
**[0:55:21-0:55:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:55:21):**  have in your hand right now is a consequence of so many generations and so much oral wisdom  
**[0:55:28-0:55:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:55:28):**  and so much indigenous wisdom of like having the corn today.  
**[0:55:32-0:55:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:55:32):**  So when you bite into that tortilla, the experience is like the aroma, everything is like, ah,  
**[0:55:40-0:55:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:55:40):**  mind blowing, mind blowing.  
**[0:55:42-0:55:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:55:42):**  My skin, you know, is like, like feeling it, like everything.  
**[0:55:46-0:55:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:55:46):**  And the way he talks to you about precisely, you know, the massive agriculture versus the  
**[0:55:51-0:55:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:55:51):**  one that he calls alternative because he didn't know, you know, regenerative agriculture,  
**[0:55:55-0:55:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:55:55):**  he just calls it alternative.  
**[0:55:57-0:56:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:55:57):**  And when I listen to him, I understand that the ones that should be learning from them  
**[0:56:01-0:56:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:56:01):**  are us and that the voice should be on them and that they are really the wisdom carriers  
**[0:56:08-0:56:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:56:08):**  and the wisdom holders.  
**[0:56:09-0:56:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:56:09):**  So I think indigenous voice should be key, centerpiece, everything.  
**[0:56:14-0:56:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:56:14):**  And they should have much more global South component in all the conversations because  
**[0:56:20-0:56:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:56:20):**  most of the biodiversity that we need to save is in the global South.  
**[0:56:24-0:56:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:56:24):**  So I'm like very worried that the conversation and the thought leadership is controlled by  
**[0:56:29-0:56:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:56:29):**  the global North.  
**[0:56:30-0:56:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:56:30):**  And that's where I'm contrarian.  
**[0:56:32-0:56:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:56:32):**  Thank you so much, Laura, for your time today to share and for your insights and all your

**[0:59:36-0:59:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:59:36):**  so you don't have to write along.  
**[0:59:38-0:59:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:59:38):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:59:43-0:59:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:59:43):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:59:49-0:59:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:59:49):**  invest in, what kind of co investors you could find, or what kind of investors you could  
**[0:59:53-0:59:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:59:53):**  find if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:59:55-1:00:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=0:59:55):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[1:00:00-1:00:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=1:00:00):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.

**[1:00:08-1:00:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=1:00:08):**  So what is it not?  
**[1:00:09-1:00:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=1:00:09):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[1:00:11-1:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=1:00:11):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[1:00:14-1:00:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=1:00:14):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[1:00:17-1:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=1:00:17):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[1:00:19-1:00:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/laura-ortiz#t=1:00:19):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.

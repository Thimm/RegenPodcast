**[0:00:12-0:00:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:00:13):**  The world of crypto and blockchain is exploding, is attracting an enormous amount of money,  
**[0:00:19-0:00:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:00:19):**  talent, resources, and obviously cowboys, scams, and Ponzi schemes.  
**[0:00:23-0:00:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:00:23):**  So what should we know in the regeneration world, in the finance world about this fascinating,  
**[0:00:29-0:00:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:00:29):**  scary and very confusing world?  
**[0:00:32-0:00:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:00:32):**  Join me today in an episode where we scratch the surface, but hopefully give you some framework,  
**[0:00:37-0:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:00:37):**  some questions to ask, some metrics to dig into, to make sense of this, as I said, very  
**[0:00:42-0:00:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:00:42):**  exciting, but also very confusing world.  
**[0:00:46-0:00:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:00:46):**  Enjoy.  
**[0:00:48-0:00:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:00:48):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture, investing as if  
**[0:00:52-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:00:52):**  the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:00:54):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:58-0:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:00:58):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work, to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:01:03-0:01:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:01:03):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:08-0:01:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:01:08):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:10-0:01:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:01:10):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:14-0:01:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:01:14):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:01:16):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:21-0:01:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:01:21):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:25-0:01:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:01:25):**  In March last year, we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support  
**[0:01:29-0:01:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:01:29):**  our work.

**[0:01:50-0:01:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:01:50):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:01:52):**  Welcome to another episode today.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:01:53):**  I'm very excited to unpack blockchains, cryptos, online communities, community currencies,  
**[0:01:58-0:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:01:58):**  and so much more with Gustav, who has been working in the field for the last five years  
**[0:02:02-0:02:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:02:02):**  as a founder on the investing side and also on the impact side.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:02:06):**  So welcome, Gustav.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:02:07):**  Thank you, Carl.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:02:08):**  Nice to be here.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:02:09):**  Can you just explain, first of all, how you got into the crypto world and then also where  
**[0:02:13-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:02:13):**  your interest in like, let's say, a healthy planet or soil comes from?  
**[0:02:17-0:02:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:02:17):**  Because you're definitely not a farmer or a soil expert, but you are very interested  
**[0:02:22-0:02:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:02:22):**  in this space.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:02:23):**  You're interested in both, let's say, journeys.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:02:24):**  How did you get into the crypto world?  
**[0:02:25-0:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:02:25):**  And then we'll unpack the other side.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:02:27):**  Yeah, sure.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:02:28):**  So I was a student in Copenhagen.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:02:31):**  I had a very, very bad concussion.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:02:33):**  We were back in like 2015 and cannot do too much.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:02:38):**  So I'm really just excited about this new thing I learned about, which was called Ethereum  
**[0:02:43-0:02:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:02:43):**  at the time, which was like a new blockchain.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:02:46):**  And via this, I started going to a meetup in Copenhagen.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:02:51):**  And via this meetup, I was invited to join the first European Blockchain Summer School,  
**[0:02:58-0:03:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:02:58):**  which was also in Copenhagen, where I was living at the time, at the IT University,  
**[0:03:02-0:03:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:03:02):**  where we had different kind of case companies and the Danish tax authorities and some banks  
**[0:03:06-0:03:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:03:06):**  and Maersk, the biggest shipping company in the world.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:03:10):**  And we did some case studies there.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:03:11):**  And after this kind of few days, I was sort of lucky enough to get some job offers from  
**[0:03:20-0:03:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:03:20):**  different organizations and I took one which was sort of the most nerdy one, which was  
**[0:03:24-0:03:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:03:24):**  a German development studio in Germany.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:03:28):**  And at that time, they had helped sort of as co-developers to build Ethereum, which  
**[0:03:33-0:03:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:03:33):**  is today the second biggest blockchain.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:03:35):**  And that's sort of what I found very interesting.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:03:36):**  I was interested before a bit because I played a lot of computer stuff in like Bitcoin, but  
**[0:03:41-0:03:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:03:41):**  I didn't see too much the use case other than this kind of small value, this is a money  
**[0:03:46-0:03:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:03:46):**  aspect.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:03:47):**  But what Ethereum was at that time and still is, is a generalized computer.  
**[0:03:54-0:03:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:03:54):**  So basically taking some of the basic ideas around this initialization that Bitcoin has  
**[0:03:58-0:04:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:03:58):**  done, but instead of only being a payment network, also sort of utilizing that as sort  
**[0:04:02-0:04:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:04:02):**  of a decentralized computer where you can put programs on.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:04:06):**  And I had studied on my bachelor's degree in science and on my master's a bit more  
**[0:04:09-0:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:04:09):**  sort of on the business side, from my business school.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:04:12):**  And I just saw that, whoa, with these things, you can really address some of the sort of  
**[0:04:16-0:04:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:04:16):**  coordination, governance, funding issues that in various literature has been sort of something  
**[0:04:22-0:04:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:04:22):**  that we spend a lot of time on.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:04:25):**  So yeah, and then I got into space, I worked there a few years at that company in Germany  
**[0:04:32-0:04:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:04:32):**  and then eventually moved on to start the company myself with some other guys and developers  
**[0:04:38-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:04:38):**  in America.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:04:39):**  And yeah, since then, I've created other stuff.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:04:42):**  I've created the cryptocurrency alliance, which was sort of more on the community, local  
**[0:04:47-0:04:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:04:47):**  currency field.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:04:48):**  And that's because the first project that I sort of led in that space was sort of mixing  
**[0:04:52-0:04:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:04:52):**  cryptocurrencies and human currencies.  
**[0:04:54-0:04:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:04:54):**  And yeah, since then, just been very active in space, investing.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:04:58):**  Now I work at what you can call a third generation blockchain, what's called Nia, which is sort  
**[0:05:03-0:05:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:05:03):**  of taking the same approach as Ethereum, generalized computer, but trying to make up some of the  
**[0:05:07-0:05:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:05:07):**  sort of shortcomings there around, you know, the energy footprint and the transaction costs  
**[0:05:13-0:05:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:05:13):**  and some other stuff around user and developer experience.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:05:16):**  And yeah, now I'm just working there and engaged in this space in various fields, also in some  
**[0:05:22-0:05:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:05:22):**  of the early sort of DOWs.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:05:24):**  And DOW is kind of funny, funny word, it means decentralized autonomous organization, which  
**[0:05:29-0:05:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:05:29):**  is not really fitting, I think, because it is sort of just, you know, you can imagine  
**[0:05:32-0:05:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:05:32):**  like kind of having a Facebook group, but not really controlled by Facebook, you cannot  
**[0:05:37-0:05:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:05:37):**  really be shut down, then having other these other things that blockchain offers, like  
**[0:05:41-0:05:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:05:41):**  specific voting systems, funding system, etc, etc.  
**[0:05:45-0:05:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:05:45):**  But basically just operating sort of a Facebook group.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:05:47):**  So the DOW sort of choose how they, you know, vote, select specific things, etc, etc.  
**[0:05:54-0:05:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:05:54):**  And yeah, so that's more or less it.  
**[0:05:55-0:05:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:05:55):**  And another topic.  
**[0:05:56-0:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:05:56):**  So I mean, I've, I've, as so many other people who've been in this podcast, and in this world,  
**[0:06:03-0:06:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:06:03):**  see what we as a species are doing, humans, destroying, destroying the planet, destroying  
**[0:06:10-0:06:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:06:10):**  sometimes ourselves as well.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:06:13):**  And I think it was really when I met Bella from Mustelseed in Switzerland, some years  
**[0:06:19-0:06:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:06:19):**  ago, which I know you also know that I really sort of got diva into it on a conscious level.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:06:25):**  And via Bella got engaged with some of the projects that this charity Mustelseed is also  
**[0:06:30-0:06:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:06:30):**  supporting.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:06:31):**  And some of them have been on this podcast as well.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:06:34):**  So yeah, but I will not in any way say that like the impact retail space, I'm just learning  
**[0:06:39-0:06:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:06:39):**  and I'm probably sort of what I can bring to the podcast is probably more on the crypto  
**[0:06:43-0:06:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:06:43):**  side, then sort of what some of the other experts in the region is also impact.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:06:50):**  Yeah, thank you so much for that intro.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:06:52):**  Definitely a shout out to Bella.  
**[0:06:54-0:06:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:06:54):**  I will put a link below for anybody that doesn't know Bella had funny, his amazing history  
**[0:06:58-0:07:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:06:58):**  and the must see trust that he is running that actually also supported this podcast.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:07:03):**  So and we met actually through them.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:07:06):**  And there's so much to unpack there.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:07:07):**  But let's start with you.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:07:08):**  You mentioned a few things, but one I really want to focus on for a second third generation  
**[0:07:13-0:07:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:07:13):**  blockchains that suggests there are two before that.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:07:16):**  And what's the advantage of let's say, let's walk us through the first, the second and  
**[0:07:20-0:07:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:07:20):**  the third and why the third is so, so important, especially I think many people will have an  
**[0:07:25-0:07:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:07:25):**  immediate reaction to block change others.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:07:27):**  So energy pollutants, they're extremely polluting in general.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:07:30):**  You already mentioned that that's been not taken care of, but being worked on.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:07:34):**  But why is that third generation so different than let's say the one and the second?  
**[0:07:39-0:07:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:07:39):**  What happened back in 2008, of course, was a financial crisis.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:07:43):**  But there was also suddenly this weird person appearing, or group of people appearing Satoshi  
**[0:07:47-0:07:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:07:47):**  Nakamoto, which sort of put Bitcoin live.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:07:52):**  And as you can imagine, it's a few years ago, but you know, this is the first time ever  
**[0:07:55-0:07:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:07:55):**  we saw this technology in the world.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:07:58):**  This was sort of Bitcoin and the first generation blockchains.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:08:01):**  I think you can think about that.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:08:03):**  That's at least how I view it.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:08:05):**  Some people disagree that, you know, when I talk with Bella, for example, around the  
**[0:08:09-0:08:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:08:09):**  first computers he worked in, you know, which was like the size of a farm, or it's not a  
**[0:08:13-0:08:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:08:13):**  big house, you know, that's how I view Bitcoin, you know, this was the first time the technology  
**[0:08:18-0:08:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:08:18):**  came out, the first instance.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:08:20):**  And this was in itself like a breakthrough technology, which have created this new paradigm  
**[0:08:25-0:08:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:08:25):**  we're in, which we can call the Web3, where blockchain is sort of one of those latest  
**[0:08:29-0:08:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:08:29):**  technologies combined with other sort of technologies.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:08:33):**  But that also means that, you know, I'm sitting in a MacBook right now, right?  
**[0:08:37-0:08:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:08:37):**  There's a big difference between the first computers you see at a museum and then a MacBook,  
**[0:08:44-0:08:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:08:44):**  or let's say an iPhone with an app store in, etc, etc.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:08:47):**  So that use case of Bitcoin is really to solve what's called the double spending problem,  
**[0:08:52-0:08:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:08:52):**  meaning that before on the currencies that had been sort of before Bitcoin, you would  
**[0:08:57-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:08:57):**  maybe have digital currency systems, but there's always some kind of trust level involved.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:09:02):**  Basically what we want to have with this type of payment system is we want to have, you  
**[0:09:07-0:09:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:09:07):**  know, a guarantee that I'm not sending the same money that I'm sending to you, to, you  
**[0:09:10-0:09:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:09:10):**  know, your friend as well, because then that undermines the whole money system.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:09:14):**  So that's kind of what...  
**[0:09:15-0:09:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:09:15):**  Yeah.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:09:16):**  And instead of having a sort of a central database that keeps track of that, aka a central  
**[0:09:20-0:09:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:09:20):**  bank, this was fixed with a distributed ledger and all kinds of level of trust without having  
**[0:09:26-0:09:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:09:26):**  one person or one organisation to trust.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:09:29):**  Like this was distributed trust, but in a currency.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:09:31):**  Exactly.  
**[0:09:32-0:09:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:09:32):**  Yeah.  
**[0:09:33-0:09:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:09:33):**  You can think about it as computers around the world, they are running some client software.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:09:38):**  And what that basically does is that they have the same view on some accounting ledger.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:09:42):**  It's not much more complicated than that, to be honest.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:09:45):**  And that's sort of that new case that now we know, verified by all these computers and  
**[0:09:50-0:09:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:09:50):**  network, that there's not one line, etc.  
**[0:09:53-0:09:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:09:53):**  It also where mining comes into the picture and all this sort of this energy war, they  
**[0:09:59-0:10:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:09:59):**  running against each other.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:10:01):**  So that's basically that.  
**[0:10:03-0:10:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:10:03):**  With Ethereum, as I briefly mentioned, and there was sort of other in between, but to  
**[0:10:08-0:10:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:10:08):**  me that's sort of the milestone for the second generation blockchains.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:10:13):**  And that's the field I've worked in also a couple of years.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:10:16):**  And they basically said, you know, why not turn this power of these computers around  
**[0:10:20-0:10:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:10:20):**  the world to create sort of a decentralised computer so that it's not only a simple payment  
**[0:10:25-0:10:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:10:25):**  use case, but, you know, you can deploy a sort of an organisation on this.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:10:29):**  You can deploy a decentralised exchange.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:10:32):**  You can deploy, you know, a carbon credit app as well.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:10:36):**  And it's maintained by the same sort of security guarantee, censorship resistant and trustlessness  
**[0:10:43-0:10:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:10:43):**  as you mentioned.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:10:44):**  So this is sort of the step into Ethereum.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:10:46):**  And Ethereum today is also super, super successful.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:10:49):**  What has then happened to Ethereum is that it's sort of got too popular in a way so that  
**[0:10:54-0:11:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:10:54):**  you have a lot of costs if you are sort of doing on-chain transactions.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:11:00):**  Sometimes you need to spend several hundred dollars to do specific type of interactions  
**[0:11:06-0:11:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:11:06):**  on Ethereum.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:11:07):**  And this is just not sustainable, of course.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:11:09):**  There are only still only kind of limited million number of users today of Ethereum.  
**[0:11:14-0:11:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:11:14):**  So for this related to scale, large scale, that's maybe not, you know, that is not great  
**[0:11:20-0:11:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:11:20):**  enough.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:11:21):**  So, and in the Ethereum space, there are a lot of kind of approaches where you take some  
**[0:11:27-0:11:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:11:27):**  of the things off-chain and you use other primitives.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:11:29):**  That's what we call sort of layer two.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:11:31):**  Layer one, when we refer to that, it's always kind of a core blockchain.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:11:34):**  Then you have layer two, which is things that sort of off-chain, but maybe have some component  
**[0:11:41-0:11:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:11:41):**  on-chain that's kind of scalability solution for Ethereum.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:11:44):**  Then you also have what I would sort of call generation three blockchains.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:11:49):**  And there they have a loop at Ethereum, which right now is also using mining and also is  
**[0:11:54-0:11:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:11:54):**  maybe a bit more energy efficient than Bitcoin, but not really a lot.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:11:59):**  And that's because it still uses this what's called proof of work.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:12:02):**  And every time we hear proof of work, this is sort of related to the mining.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:12:06):**  Meaning mining, simply meaning many computers running.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:12:10):**  Like you have to imagine again, like a farm size or more of servers running 24-7 using  
**[0:12:16-0:12:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:12:16):**  electricity, obviously in places where it's cheap.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:12:19):**  So mining in this case is a lot of computers, but go on Google if you're interested or YouTube  
**[0:12:23-0:12:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:12:23):**  and find some videos of this.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:12:24):**  This is our massive, massive farms, literally farming these blockchains.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:12:29):**  And that's proof of work.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:12:30):**  And we've been talking a long time about proof of stake for Ethereum to go to a more efficient  
**[0:12:36-0:12:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:12:36):**  way of doing that.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:12:37):**  Is that any way we're near?  
**[0:12:39-0:12:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:12:39):**  Like would they sort of, would then Ethereum become also the third generation or would  
**[0:12:43-0:12:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:12:43):**  they be stuck in 2.5?  
**[0:12:45-0:12:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:12:45):**  What is your view there?  
**[0:12:46-0:12:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:12:46):**  To me, it looks like it's underway well for becoming what we can call a true third generation  
**[0:12:50-0:12:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:12:50):**  blockchain.  
**[0:12:51-0:12:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:12:51):**  The thing is that imagine if you have a system right now with Ethereum, and I don't make  
**[0:12:55-0:12:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:12:55):**  exact numbers right now, but let's say $400 billion, maybe it's worth right now.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:12:59):**  It's not something you just migrate.  
**[0:13:01-0:13:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:13:01):**  Yeah, just for people to understand, like there are hundreds of billions of dollars  
**[0:13:05-0:13:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:13:05):**  real money going through the different blockchains, of course, mostly in the larger ones.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:13:10):**  But this is a space where a lot is happening.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:13:12):**  A lot of money is going around, a lot of infrastructure costs are being paid.  
**[0:13:16-0:13:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:13:16):**  A lot of people are putting serious money into these farms as well.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:13:19):**  And there's a lot of space for, let's say, for experimentation.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:13:23):**  There's a lot of money around looking for, to build new things, to develop things, to,  
**[0:13:28-0:13:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:13:28):**  of course, risk wise, it's enormous because we're in the super, super, super early stage.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:13:33):**  But definitely from an evolution point of view, experimentation point of view, we're  
**[0:13:37-0:13:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:13:37):**  in a very interesting phase of the whole evolution.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:13:40):**  And if you're saying Ethereum like $400 billion just for people, that's a four with 11 zeros,  
**[0:13:45-0:13:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:13:45):**  just to understand.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:13:46):**  Yeah.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:13:47):**  And I would say, yes, they are full on the way.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:13:48):**  And I believe they are sort of three steps defined.  
**[0:13:51-0:13:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:13:51):**  So what Ethereum basically is doing is that they are sort of creating a parallel chain,  
**[0:13:54-0:13:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:13:54):**  which is called the beacon chain.  
**[0:13:56-0:13:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:13:56):**  And they are slowly transitioning everything on Ethereum to that thing.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:13:58):**  And that thing is running on good state.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:14:01):**  But it's sort of a step to go there.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:14:02):**  So there is no mistake made on the way because a lot of hackers or people trying to exploit  
**[0:14:08-0:14:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:14:08):**  whatever they can find to extract this money.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:14:11):**  That's why it's probably a bit harder process for Ethereum to migrate because they have  
**[0:14:16-0:14:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:14:16):**  a live system.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:14:17):**  Whereas what the other third-generation blockchain have done is sort of started this network  
**[0:14:23-0:14:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:14:23):**  from the beginning.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:14:24):**  From zero.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:14:25):**  And they looked at Ethereum.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:14:26):**  They maybe wanted to build an app on Ethereum.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:14:29):**  They thought it's not really possible.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:14:31):**  It's too expensive.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:14:32):**  It's too slow, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:14:34):**  Maybe there are other usability things as well from the developer side or the user side  
**[0:14:39-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:14:39):**  that maybe do better.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:14:40):**  And then they did that from scratch on.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:14:44):**  And yeah, so most of those are running different versions then of proof of stake protocols.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:14:49):**  When we say proof of stake in opposed to mining, where mining is this, as you say, kind of  
**[0:14:54-0:15:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:14:54):**  computing game where whatever computer can first solve a very complicated mathematical  
**[0:15:00-0:15:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:15:00):**  problem, they get a reward.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:15:03):**  That's sort of how the protocol is structured.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:15:04):**  That's how someone is in the sort of network competing to serve you by processing your  
**[0:15:14-0:15:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:15:14):**  transaction.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:15:15):**  And whoever can do this fastest will get it.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:15:19):**  And whoever can do it fastest, it's typically the people with the best hardware.  
**[0:15:23-0:15:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:15:23):**  And that's why it started with something you could do on a very bad laptop.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:15:27):**  And now, as you say, this competition has gone so far that it's now these big data centers.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:15:33):**  And I mean, I don't know those exact numbers.  
**[0:15:35-0:15:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:15:35):**  If we talk about energy consumption of countries or whatever, it's always debated.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:15:39):**  But it's definitely a lot of energy that's spent there, which is kind of ridiculous in  
**[0:15:43-0:15:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:15:43):**  my opinion.  
**[0:15:44-0:15:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:15:44):**  So proof of stake then means that there are different variations here.  
**[0:15:48-0:15:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:15:48):**  But you could kind of say, OK, Kohn, so you would like to stake here.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:15:52):**  So maybe you put X amount of tokens.  
**[0:15:55-0:15:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:15:55):**  Let's say on here, for example, where you put X amount of near.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:15:58):**  If you are behaving well and just running like a normal kind of cloud server, so not  
**[0:16:04-0:16:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:16:04):**  all this extra energy efficient, sorry, inefficient stuff, then you're going to get a reward.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:16:10):**  However, if we catch you trying to do some malicious transaction or try to game the network,  
**[0:16:16-0:16:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:16:16):**  then you're going to lose your stake.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:16:18):**  This is basically the kind of the logic behind this consensus algorithm.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:16:23):**  So it's only holding my tokens and not I don't have to create them or I don't have to mine  
**[0:16:28-0:16:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:16:28):**  them to with a lot of energy to prove that I have them.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:16:32):**  I put them in a sort of holding or I put them in an escrow and then I have to behave well.  
**[0:16:37-0:16:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:16:37):**  And if I do that, I'm fine.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:16:38):**  And if I don't lose my stake.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:16:40):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:16:41):**  And that's when you look at these networks, there are people sitting and designing these  
**[0:16:45-0:16:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:16:45):**  things and they look at them.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:16:47):**  So what's your cost?  
**[0:16:48-0:16:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:16:48):**  Okay, so you could try to do malicious attack once.  
**[0:16:50-0:16:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:16:50):**  You lose all your money.  
**[0:16:51-0:16:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:16:51):**  You can try again.  
**[0:16:52-0:16:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:16:52):**  You lose all your money.  
**[0:16:53-0:16:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:16:53):**  And at some point it's maybe not going to be worth it for you to try to game the system.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:16:57):**  There are also other protocols where someone can point out that Kone is doing this, then  
**[0:17:01-0:17:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:17:01):**  that person maybe get a large amount of the coins that are slashed from you to incentivize  
**[0:17:09-0:17:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:17:09):**  people call like with blowing as well.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:17:11):**  So that's how these sort of incentives in these consensus algorithms are.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:17:17):**  Trust is built.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:17:18):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:17:19):**  So that's the basic design principle.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:17:21):**  There are foundation also have this distributed network where people don't know or like necessarily  
**[0:17:26-0:17:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:17:26):**  trust each other, but they follow the same protocol where these incentives are sort of  
**[0:17:31-0:17:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:17:31):**  baked in and allegedly then being secure.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:17:35):**  You see sometimes blockchains that are not as secure as they thought it would be.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:17:39):**  So obviously when we talk about like trustless systems, I think that's kind of the sign criteria,  
**[0:17:46-0:17:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:17:46):**  but I certainly don't understand how most of this stuff work myself, right?  
**[0:17:50-0:17:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:17:50):**  So I have people that I trust that say they fully understand it, etc. etc.  
**[0:17:55-0:17:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:17:55):**  So I think it's always going to be trust in my opinion.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:17:57):**  I think trust is sort of fundamental of human beings.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:18:00):**  So I'm not in that kind of school where I think like no trust at all.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:18:05):**  But the system itself should be minimalized as much as possible.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:18:08):**  And as the software is open source, you could say sort of, well, maybe not everyone in the  
**[0:18:14-0:18:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:18:14):**  world can have the ability to go and look at the code and understand themself.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:18:18):**  But knowing that everyone in the world have the option to do that and everything sort  
**[0:18:22-0:18:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:18:22):**  of on the table, it's very different than say, I would like now to have a balance in  
**[0:18:28-0:18:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:18:28):**  the internet market and see the balance of all banks.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:18:31):**  This is just not public information.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:18:32):**  So bringing all of this stuff to the public domain and using open source software that  
**[0:18:36-0:18:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:18:36):**  everyone can verify, I think that also helps a lot sort of on the trust side to catch errors  
**[0:18:42-0:18:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:18:42):**  or to like see, okay, we don't just have to take your word for it.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:18:46):**  We actually have ways to try to verify.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:18:48):**  Yeah, your skin in the game.  
**[0:18:49-0:18:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:18:49):**  And so this sounds extremely interesting, but also relatively, I would say, quote unquote,  
**[0:18:54-0:18:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:18:54):**  far away from the physical world.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:18:57):**  But I know there are a lot of points where it touches the physical world, the way you  
**[0:19:00-0:19:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:19:00):**  see in the near future it will touch.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:19:02):**  So let's go over a few of those where let's say you get excited where it could touch the  
**[0:19:07-0:19:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:19:07):**  ways of how to create a healthy planet and what you think that the audience in this case,  
**[0:19:13-0:19:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:19:13):**  it might be experts on this or not at all, should really know about what is coming or  
**[0:19:17-0:19:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:19:17):**  what is already there.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:19:18):**  What are some, you mentioned DAOs at the beginning, let's unpack those maybe a bit or some other  
**[0:19:23-0:19:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:19:23):**  funding models, like how does it touch the world of farm, soil, trees, et cetera, and  
**[0:19:28-0:19:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:19:28):**  what we should know about this.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:19:29):**  Yeah, so we have these type of different like primitives or tools that is increasingly become  
**[0:19:35-0:19:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:19:35):**  much more available for everyone in the world.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:19:37):**  And one day, when we say DAO, this is just the type of organisation.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:19:41):**  I'm for example part of VC investment fund, we operate as a DAO.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:19:44):**  This means that we have pooled our money together into a smart contract.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:19:48):**  A smart contract is then a small program we have put in this case on Ethereum blockchain.  
**[0:19:53-0:19:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:19:53):**  And then we can collaboratively make decisions.  
**[0:19:55-0:20:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:19:55):**  Why did you choose Ethereum in this case, as you say, the transaction fees or the like  
**[0:20:00-0:20:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:20:00):**  you need a lot to do transactions or was it the easiest option because it's the most widely  
**[0:20:05-0:20:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:20:05):**  used smart contract blockchain?  
**[0:20:08-0:20:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:20:08):**  At that time, there was not really third generation blockchains alive like two years ago.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:20:13):**  And at the same time, maybe it's okay for us to pay 50 or 100 dollars to make transactions  
**[0:20:17-0:20:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:20:17):**  when we do like larger investments, whereas they're not okay to recover coffee.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:20:22):**  So it depends a bit on the specific use case.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:20:25):**  The use case, of course.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:20:27):**  And so this is an investment fund.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:20:28):**  So you pooled money like many people might know in, let's say the Silicon Valley way  
**[0:20:32-0:20:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:20:32):**  or others.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:20:33):**  They pooled money from a lot of people in this case, not necessarily accredited investors.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:20:37):**  They could be anywhere in the world.  
**[0:20:38-0:20:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:20:38):**  They pooled their virtual currencies obviously in one smart contract.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:20:42):**  And then what happened?  
**[0:20:44-0:20:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:20:44):**  Like you don't have a fund manager, right?  
**[0:20:45-0:20:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:20:45):**  Like one person that sits on what is it Mountain View or whatever in Silicon Valley deciding  
**[0:20:50-0:20:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:20:50):**  what to do with this.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:20:51):**  How is this different?  
**[0:20:52-0:20:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:20:52):**  In our case, we don't have it.  
**[0:20:54-0:20:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:20:54):**  Other investment DAOs might have it.  
**[0:20:56-0:20:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:20:56):**  That depends everything you know, on the legal setup they have chosen, etc.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:20:59):**  We are sort of more an investment club as you may.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:21:01):**  So there, what we do is that we issue sort of new shares every quarter.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:21:06):**  And based on this, we are using different systems to sort of internally assess who have  
**[0:21:12-0:21:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:21:12):**  added value this quarter.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:21:14):**  And those people then get higher to get more shares.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:21:18):**  And the people who didn't do anything, they get diluted basically.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:21:21):**  We see all every time what's in the treasury, there is no person who is like the accounting  
**[0:21:26-0:21:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:21:26):**  person who we have to trust that takes well-care for finances, etc.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:21:30):**  We can, everyone can see that.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:21:32):**  Then on each investment we are voting on chain with the number of shares we have in the thing.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:21:37):**  We then have the same amount of vote in the investment.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:21:40):**  If then there are investment decisions that we find it's like very bad and like I'm not  
**[0:21:45-0:21:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:21:45):**  really interested in taking classes anymore.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:21:47):**  We could at any time rate quit, which means that we can then sort of at the same time  
**[0:21:53-0:21:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:21:53):**  get out what we actually are entitled to in the investment fund and say, okay, this decision  
**[0:21:57-0:21:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:21:57):**  is too bad.  
**[0:21:58-0:21:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:21:58):**  I want to get out now.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:21:59):**  And that's something typically that maybe you don't have the inside ability to do in  
**[0:22:03-0:22:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:22:03):**  traditional investment funds.  
**[0:22:04-0:22:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:22:04):**  So the liquidity is instant if you want and you're very involved, let's say in the day-to-day  
**[0:22:09-0:22:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:22:09):**  running of the fund.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:22:10):**  Like you find investments, you do DD, you do a lot of these things and all of that is  
**[0:22:16-0:22:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:22:16):**  visible.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:22:17):**  And for all of that, you get, let's say activity points.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:22:20):**  You're very active and that means that you get more shares over time of the fund, of  
**[0:22:25-0:22:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:22:25):**  the investment club and people that are no longer active or not active basically slowly  
**[0:22:30-0:22:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:22:30):**  get diluted.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:22:31):**  And so it's a constantly evolving almost organism.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:22:34):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:22:35):**  And in turn, then many of the other members, they are sort of representing more traditional  
**[0:22:39-0:22:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:22:39):**  VC funds.  
**[0:22:40-0:22:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:22:40):**  So it also serves sort of as a network between those members where they can actually then  
**[0:22:47-0:22:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:22:47):**  get a new deal lead.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:22:48):**  They can get that in and then based on the interest and if it happens, then, you know,  
**[0:22:54-0:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:22:54):**  they also get the extra for that.  
**[0:22:56-0:23:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:22:56):**  So that's just like maybe it's not that interesting for this crowd, but it's just like an example  
**[0:23:01-0:23:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:23:01):**  of how, you know, the VC model is being reinvented.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:23:05):**  But there are funding wise many types of like these new tools.  
**[0:23:09-0:23:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:23:09):**  Another power I mean is taking, you might say the complete opposite approach.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:23:14):**  This is a charity and a sort of association and it's called the common stack which funds  
**[0:23:24-0:23:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:23:24):**  a good infrastructure in this space.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:23:26):**  And then we also apply sort of the same.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:23:28):**  Of course, we can always choose our own governance.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:23:32):**  How should we, what type of voting do we want, etc, etc.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:23:35):**  And then we apply that just for another sort of case and an argument with people.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:23:39):**  So this is just to show that this is how organizations can operate very efficiently.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:23:45):**  There are some doubts which for the group where it's sort of it's not really having  
**[0:23:49-0:23:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:23:49):**  a legal entity or what we call a legal wrapper and it's not, you know, sort of compliant  
**[0:23:55-0:23:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:23:55):**  with general sort of depends on again, the jurisdiction, etc.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:23:59):**  And then these two examples I mentioned, they are sort of, they actually just make the entities,  
**[0:24:05-0:24:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:24:05):**  they just use these tools.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:24:07):**  So they're fully legal.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:24:08):**  They use these tools just for anybody that say, yeah, but what about it's our fully legal  
**[0:24:12-0:24:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:24:12):**  entities and they use the virtual tools, let's say to operate and to make, in this case,  
**[0:24:17-0:24:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:24:17):**  investment decisions or charity decisions, I think is fascinating as well.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:24:20):**  You're basically, you bring in charities and you operate a much more efficient.  
**[0:24:25-0:24:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:24:25):**  I mean, we all know the issues with the charity industry and the way of decision-making there  
**[0:24:31-0:24:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:24:31):**  from an office far away.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:24:32):**  We know what's good for you in a small village somewhere.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:24:35):**  I mean the typical model and in this case it's fully decentralized and it's fully accessible  
**[0:24:40-0:24:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:24:40):**  and open as well.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:24:41):**  Like anybody in there can see exactly what's been happening with every single Euro currency  
**[0:24:47-0:24:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:24:47):**  or whatever has been used, which is in itself, the transparency is already revolutionary  
**[0:24:51-0:24:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:24:51):**  for many ways.  
**[0:24:52-0:24:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:24:52):**  Yeah.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:24:53):**  And you see, of course, charities are embracing Facebook, etc.  
**[0:24:56-0:24:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:24:56):**  Like rapidly, right?  
**[0:24:57-0:25:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:24:57):**  And that has already like, imagine how many like local groups, grassroots groups, etc.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:25:03):**  Like local farming groups have set up Facebook groups.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:25:05):**  Well, this is sort of just like a Facebook group and the record headers too, if you don't  
**[0:25:08-0:25:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:25:08):**  care if you use Facebook or not, right?  
**[0:25:10-0:25:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:25:10):**  So you can see what they do care about is like depending where you are, for example,  
**[0:25:13-0:25:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:25:13):**  in Switzerland where I live.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:25:15):**  So the tax authorities wants to see like an invoice per transaction outgoing, if it's  
**[0:25:21-0:25:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:25:21):**  like a certain amount, probably KYC.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:25:23):**  So you know who you're dealing with.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:25:25):**  And then we need a valuation to Twitter, Frank, so we can assess the tax impact as well.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:25:30):**  And if there's any, if it's like within Switzerland, VAT.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:25:33):**  So as long as you can't give them that, you can, you can utilize the power tools, which  
**[0:25:38-0:25:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:25:38):**  suddenly and of course that depends from charity to charity, but from sort of my small experience  
**[0:25:45-0:25:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:25:45):**  in that world, not that many enable, you know, their members to real time vote and this gets  
**[0:25:50-0:25:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:25:50):**  executed like every week if we want to, you know, actually support this project or not  
**[0:25:55-0:26:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:25:55):**  and have these other incentives that sort of makes this organization larger than just  
**[0:26:00-0:26:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:26:00):**  like top management, etc.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:26:02):**  So yeah, I think that's where this offers a very interesting tool.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:26:07):**  And I think most organizations in the world within some years are going to operate like  
**[0:26:12-0:26:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:26:12):**  this because it is just very, very efficient and can scale like a lot sooner.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:26:20):**  And especially when you, that's what I'm sort of motivating in these words, actually operating  
**[0:26:26-0:26:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:26:26):**  from the identity.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:26:27):**  So you don't sort of get into any hiccups afterwards.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:26:29):**  Yeah, because we've seen examples obviously there where, I mean, you need to, as you said,  
**[0:26:34-0:26:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:26:34):**  if you want to operate in that way, you need to have somewhere a connection to a physical  
**[0:26:39-0:26:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:26:39):**  country, you need to have a good grip on taxes, you need to have a good grip on invoices,  
**[0:26:44-0:26:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:26:44):**  you need to have a good grip on know your customer.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:26:46):**  And of course, because you are dealing with financial assets, which depending on where  
**[0:26:51-0:26:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:26:51):**  you are, are heavily regulated or less heavily regulated.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:26:54):**  But there are definitely ways, I think that's the lesson here to do it fully transparent  
**[0:26:58-0:27:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:26:58):**  and fully legal at the same time, which I think five years ago were impossible because  
**[0:27:02-0:27:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:27:02):**  many governments weren't up to speed with many things.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:27:05):**  And I'm not saying everywhere it is the case, but you can find places where if you want  
**[0:27:09-0:27:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:27:09):**  to, you can do this fully in the, let's say the daylight.  
**[0:27:11-0:27:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:27:11):**  Yeah, fully.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:27:12):**  And yeah, and then what I think it can offer is like different funding aspects and different  
**[0:27:16-0:27:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:27:16):**  coordination aspects.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:27:17):**  It's not just like a board meeting one time a year or a newsletter that is sent out to  
**[0:27:21-0:27:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:27:21):**  the members of the charity, for example, or a cooperative, etc.  
**[0:27:25-0:27:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:27:25):**  No, you can actually let people have a say in like decision as they want.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:27:29):**  You can have specific like sub work groups, etc.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:27:31):**  Of course, it's not like, you know, we have not learned something in terms of organisations  
**[0:27:35-0:27:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:27:35):**  throughout, like human history, right?  
**[0:27:37-0:27:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:27:37):**  There are often reasons why organisations are structured as they are.  
**[0:27:40-0:27:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:27:40):**  That's often in this space, I think that we try to reinvent everything and many things  
**[0:27:45-0:27:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:27:45):**  in like social constructions.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:27:47):**  At the same time.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:27:48):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:27:49-0:27:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:27:49):**  But still, I think it's very appealing to enable your members or in a cooperative, for  
**[0:27:53-0:27:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:27:53):**  example, to be very active and to have good insights in the reports, because it also means  
**[0:27:58-0:28:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:27:58):**  that now people bring new insights when they actually can see in real time what the treasury  
**[0:28:02-0:28:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:28:02):**  is or how much it's costing, etc.  
**[0:28:05-0:28:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:28:05):**  So that's what I'm seeing sometimes is that then that gives an enormous involvement because  
**[0:28:12-0:28:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:28:12):**  it motivates people a lot as well.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:28:14):**  And you can also put incentives so that if they then add extra value and the other members  
**[0:28:17-0:28:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:28:17):**  assess that, we choose what type of incentive tool we want to use to do that.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:28:22):**  And the same with voting, like what type of voting do we want?  
**[0:28:24-0:28:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:28:24):**  Is it one vote per person?  
**[0:28:25-0:28:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:28:25):**  Is it like more like we delegate?  
**[0:28:28-0:28:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:28:28):**  Is this more like an liquid democracy?  
**[0:28:30-0:28:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:28:30):**  Are we more sort of conditioned voting where I sort of believe so much in something that  
**[0:28:33-0:28:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:28:33):**  I sort of state on it myself?  
**[0:28:36-0:28:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:28:36):**  So we have all these different versions and obviously for all types of organizations,  
**[0:28:40-0:28:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:28:40):**  there might be different combinations of such that makes sense for that organization.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:28:45):**  Yeah, I remember, this is quite a few years ago, I'll put a link in the show notes as  
**[0:28:49-0:28:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:28:49):**  well, but a Brazilian company called Semco that went fully transparent.  
**[0:28:54-0:28:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:28:54):**  So everybody in their organization, this is a large company building factories, mostly  
**[0:28:58-0:29:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:28:58):**  like cookie factories and things like that.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:29:00):**  And then distributed into many other things very organically because they took that approach  
**[0:29:04-0:29:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:29:04):**  of behaving like an organism.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:29:07):**  And this was without the blockchain.  
**[0:29:08-0:29:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:29:08):**  I'm pretty sure it would have been built on the blockchain if Ricardo started it now,  
**[0:29:12-0:29:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:29:12):**  but it was fully transparent.  
**[0:29:14-0:29:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:29:14):**  Like everybody down to the cleaning woman or man knew could look into the books, but  
**[0:29:19-0:29:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:29:19):**  it was actually trained to actually read them as well because otherwise it's very easy to  
**[0:29:23-0:29:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:29:23):**  say all the books are here, go and have a look.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:29:25):**  But if you're not trained in accountancy, you have no clue what to look for.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:29:28):**  And that unleashed an enormous amount of creativity.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:29:32):**  Most people were in their different teams, also responsible for their own salaries and  
**[0:29:37-0:29:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:29:37):**  were fully transparent on that as well, which unleashed an enormous amount of transparency  
**[0:29:41-0:29:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:29:41):**  and innovation there as well.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:29:43):**  Many people left the company, sort of founded another piece, but then within the same group,  
**[0:29:47-0:29:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:29:47):**  many people, whenever there was another crisis in Brazil, managed to find enormous savings  
**[0:29:51-0:29:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:29:51):**  everywhere because they knew exactly what everybody else was working on and what they  
**[0:29:55-0:29:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:29:55):**  were working on and where the money went to.  
**[0:29:57-0:30:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:29:57):**  Nobody ever, when traveling, this is one of those funny examples, they didn't need to  
**[0:30:00-0:30:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:30:00):**  ask for a corporate credit card.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:30:02):**  They didn't need to ask for a certain permission.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:30:04):**  They were completely free to spend whatever they wanted because they were trusted that  
**[0:30:09-0:30:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:30:09):**  if they were going anywhere on an overseas trip, that they were able to understand what  
**[0:30:13-0:30:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:30:13):**  was fair, if they had to buy a first class ticket or not, what kind of hotel, what kind  
**[0:30:17-0:30:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:30:17):**  of meal.  
**[0:30:18-0:30:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:30:18):**  There were no protocols for that because they were trusted in actually being a human being  
**[0:30:22-0:30:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:30:22):**  and knowing that if they would spend money of the company, that was fine, but they were  
**[0:30:26-0:30:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:30:26):**  partly spending their own money.  
**[0:30:27-0:30:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:30:27):**  Of course, they didn't take it to the next level of ownership as well, but people really  
**[0:30:31-0:30:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:30:31):**  felt ownership or few ownership.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:30:32):**  This company has survived ups and downs, enormous growth for, I think, plus 20 plus years in  
**[0:30:38-0:30:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:30:38):**  a very, let's say, quote unquote different way.  
**[0:30:41-0:30:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:30:41):**  But everybody found, I mean, unleashed an innovation.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:30:44):**  It wasn't for everybody, let's be clear, but it was for many people, the best place to  
**[0:30:48-0:30:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:30:48):**  work and the best place to spend almost all their time.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:30:51):**  Many people overworked, even if there were no incentives because it was their home and  
**[0:30:55-0:30:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:30:55):**  their family basically.  
**[0:30:56-0:30:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:30:56):**  Yeah.  
**[0:30:57-0:31:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:30:57):**  And I think that can motivate a lot of people for a lot of things.  
**[0:31:00-0:31:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:31:00):**  It's important for me to say that, of course, many organizations have things that they don't  
**[0:31:05-0:31:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:31:05):**  like to be put in the public and maybe rightfully so.  
**[0:31:08-0:31:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:31:08):**  So then, for this stuff to really go mainstream, of course, some organization will not put  
**[0:31:15-0:31:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:31:15):**  everything on the table and there are also privacy technologies to enable that.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:31:21):**  But for a lot of things, you could do a lot of interesting stuff for this, especially  
**[0:31:24-0:31:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:31:24):**  if it's stuff like that you consider in the public domain or something like that, where  
**[0:31:29-0:31:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:31:29):**  there is maybe an interest and it's like adding a lot of value for us as a species that those  
**[0:31:34-0:31:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:31:34):**  things are open.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:31:36):**  Again, I can just talk about the Interbank market, right?  
**[0:31:39-0:31:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:31:39):**  We have very little insight into when they are systemic risks and pressures that would  
**[0:31:45-0:31:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:31:45):**  actually impact all of us.  
**[0:31:47-0:31:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:31:47):**  If there's another 2008 crisis again, imagine how much money is going into impact investment,  
**[0:31:53-0:31:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:31:53):**  right?  
**[0:31:54-0:31:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:31:54):**  A lot.  
**[0:31:55-0:31:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:31:55):**  So there are things there where we actually maybe have a right to have public insight  
**[0:31:59-0:32:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:31:59):**  into what's going on there because that's going to avoid a lot of stuff.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:32:04):**  And on the other side, of course, things that depending on the company type or existing  
**[0:32:09-0:32:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:32:09):**  type, you don't really want to be out in the public for business purposes or for privacy  
**[0:32:14-0:32:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:32:14):**  data purposes.  
**[0:32:16-0:32:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:32:16):**  So I'm not saying everything should be an open front payment as well, but having some  
**[0:32:19-0:32:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:32:19):**  of these things out in transparent can really add a lot for the earth as a whole or as you  
**[0:32:25-0:32:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:32:25):**  talk about employees and being more involved and engaged and grinding innovation and results  
**[0:32:31-0:32:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:32:31):**  from that.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:32:32):**  So I have so many questions, but we're not going to get to all of them.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:32:36):**  We're only going to scratch the surface, which is fine.  
**[0:32:38-0:32:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:32:38):**  We'll repeat this at some point, but I know you have some interesting thoughts like what  
**[0:32:43-0:32:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:32:43):**  this could mean for the podcast or our audience.  
**[0:32:46-0:32:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:32:46):**  I always ask that question of what would you do with a 1 billion investment fund tomorrow  
**[0:32:50-0:32:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:32:50):**  morning or now, but this is instant so we have to say now.  
**[0:32:53-0:32:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:32:53):**  How would you, not necessarily how would you put that to work, but how would you structure  
**[0:32:58-0:32:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:32:58):**  that?  
**[0:32:59-0:33:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:32:59):**  And if you were to put that to work, you would apply to this for people just to see the possibilities  
**[0:33:03-0:33:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:33:03):**  of what is already possible now or very, very near future, like where everything goes at  
**[0:33:08-0:33:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:33:08):**  a breathtaking speed at the moment.  
**[0:33:10-0:33:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:33:10):**  So what would you do if you would be an investor with a billion dollars or whatever currency  
**[0:33:14-0:33:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:33:14):**  you want, but let's say a lot of money to put into making this planet a livable planet  
**[0:33:19-0:33:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:33:19):**  again?  
**[0:33:20-0:33:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:33:20):**  Yeah, so I try to be very honest to you, Kon, that I'm not really an expert in retail  
**[0:33:25-0:33:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:33:25):**  selling culture, etc.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:33:26):**  That's sort of my starting point.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:33:27):**  Me neither.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:33:28):**  I just follow the podcast.  
**[0:33:29-0:33:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:33:29):**  I know a few projects, etc., etc.  
**[0:33:30-0:33:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:33:30):**  But that would be my starting point to say, actually, you don't know so much about this  
**[0:33:35-0:33:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:33:35):**  stuff here.  
**[0:33:36-0:33:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:33:36):**  But I do trust that, let's say, if we would look at and we could maybe see, okay, this  
**[0:33:41-0:33:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:33:41):**  person and verify that this person, because you have also like podcast platforms that  
**[0:33:45-0:33:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:33:45):**  are on blockchain now and they can see that, you know, it's the same wallet address showing  
**[0:33:49-0:33:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:33:49):**  that it's the same kind of person that have listened to similar podcasts 20 times.  
**[0:33:54-0:33:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:33:54):**  Then I would say, okay, so everyone who listens to a podcast, at least like 20 podcast of  
**[0:33:57-0:34:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:33:57):**  views, plus perhaps all the guests that are sort of experts, they would be my signal for  
**[0:34:03-0:34:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:34:03):**  sort of the collaborative funding process.  
**[0:34:05-0:34:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:34:05):**  Okay.  
**[0:34:06-0:34:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:34:06):**  So you would look at like a group of, we can verify that they, let's say, no more than  
**[0:34:12-0:34:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:34:12):**  the average or more than you, but we can have an estimated guess.  
**[0:34:14-0:34:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:34:14):**  Like we're not sure, sure, obviously, if they're good investors, but at least it's a signal  
**[0:34:18-0:34:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:34:18):**  that they know quite a bit about the space because we've interviewed them and or they  
**[0:34:23-0:34:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:34:23):**  may, it might be the same person, but they listen to quite a few episodes all the way  
**[0:34:26-0:34:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:34:26):**  through, not just the first five minutes.  
**[0:34:28-0:34:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:34:28):**  Yeah.  
**[0:34:29-0:34:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:34:29):**  And then what sort of is working very well in the Ethereum ecosystem is a platform called  
**[0:34:34-0:34:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:34:34):**  the Gitcoin and that's using what's called quadratic funding.  
**[0:34:37-0:34:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:34:37):**  So that basically means that I have sometimes donated money, I sometimes received a bit  
**[0:34:42-0:34:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:34:42):**  of money where I would say, all right, with this money, I would say maybe, okay, let's  
**[0:34:47-0:34:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:34:47):**  do this the next 10 years every quarter.  
**[0:34:49-0:34:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:34:49):**  I am going to allocate the according percentage of that money as matching funding.  
**[0:34:54-0:34:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:34:54):**  And this is using this principle of quadratic funding.  
**[0:34:57-0:34:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:34:57):**  Quadratic funding.  
**[0:34:58-0:34:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:34:58):**  I'm going to put it in the notes.  
**[0:34:59-0:35:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:34:59):**  People don't worry.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:35:00):**  There will be a lot of notes after this interview.  
**[0:35:02-0:35:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:35:02):**  So we'll say, okay, we're going to do something every quarter for the next 10 years because  
**[0:35:05-0:35:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:35:05):**  we feel it's the next 10 years are going to be crucial and you're going to match things.  
**[0:35:09-0:35:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:35:09):**  Yeah, because you know, this is kind of, which is sometimes okay as well, but I would sort  
**[0:35:14-0:35:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:35:14):**  of, you know, sometimes there is this problem that, you know, I would just tell you, ah,  
**[0:35:17-0:35:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:35:17):**  you should donate to this project, but I'm not really donating myself.  
**[0:35:20-0:35:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:35:20):**  So why do I think you should donate to it if I'm not up for doing it myself?  
**[0:35:24-0:35:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:35:24):**  And this is sort of this basic idea of skin in the game.  
**[0:35:28-0:35:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:35:28):**  So then this matching would sort of look like that depends on the matching algorithm, which  
**[0:35:31-0:35:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:35:31):**  is something that, you know, Bitcoin had done this for a long time and it's like the last  
**[0:35:35-0:35:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:35:35):**  two years and it's evolving all the time too.  
**[0:35:39-0:35:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:35:39):**  But basically you would say something along the lines that, okay, so if there is this  
**[0:35:43-0:35:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:35:43):**  farm in Berlin, right, nearby Berlin that is doing recent tech projects, they put over  
**[0:35:48-0:35:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:35:48):**  like a grant where they describe and then copy page, what are they seeking?  
**[0:35:54-0:35:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:35:54):**  What kind of funding are they seeking and what are kind of their projects and deliverables?  
**[0:35:59-0:36:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:35:59):**  They're kind of free to do that.  
**[0:36:00-0:36:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:36:00):**  In other implementations it's more like standardized, so it's easier maybe to look at, but that  
**[0:36:04-0:36:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:36:04):**  looks a bit like a normal crowdfunding sort of site, right?  
**[0:36:08-0:36:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:36:08):**  But then you can then tell, well, if someone, and then that depends on the matching algorithm,  
**[0:36:15-0:36:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:36:15):**  if it's like 100 unique people that we can sort of verify are unique and maybe also rank  
**[0:36:20-0:36:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:36:20):**  them depending on sort of the expert level, if they put their own money into this project,  
**[0:36:25-0:36:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:36:25):**  that probably gives some signal that this is better than, you know, the scam project  
**[0:36:29-0:36:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:36:29):**  Gosh just put up and he doesn't know anything about reaching the funding, right?  
**[0:36:32-0:36:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:36:32):**  So if for each of these people in this case, if they put in $10 each, then I will match  
**[0:36:38-0:36:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:36:38):**  it with $50 each of those people who put in their own money and we can verify that they  
**[0:36:42-0:36:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:36:42):**  are sort of, you know, individuals and they are knowledgeable about this space based on  
**[0:36:46-0:36:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:36:46):**  some criteria.  
**[0:36:47-0:36:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:36:47):**  We cannot never fully, that's always like a thing, we can never fully make that perfect.  
**[0:36:51-0:36:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:36:51):**  That's like another big problem in IT, how to fully like show that you're fully unique,  
**[0:36:56-0:36:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:36:56):**  et cetera, et cetera, but it works fairly well.  
**[0:36:58-0:37:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:36:58):**  And then based on that, I'm actually not making that decision.  
**[0:37:01-0:37:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:37:01):**  I'm just trying to let my funding be allocated based on that signal of sort of people who  
**[0:37:08-0:37:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:37:08):**  know more about it than me and who put their own money as well.  
**[0:37:11-0:37:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:37:11):**  That's sort of just to avoid any sort of obvious spam issues, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:37:17-0:37:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:37:17):**  So I think that's basically how I would go about it, I think.  
**[0:37:20-0:37:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:37:20):**  And I would, within the field I would fund, I would then try to, you know, grade and adjust  
**[0:37:27-0:37:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:37:27):**  this matching algorithm, et cetera, et cetera, based on, you know, the specific topic and  
**[0:37:32-0:37:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:37:32):**  what makes sense.  
**[0:37:33-0:37:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:37:33):**  And obviously, I mean, you mentioned the grant, but this could be an investment as well.  
**[0:37:37-0:37:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:37:37):**  And I think the underlying, the key point here is you're very clearly saying, and I  
**[0:37:42-0:37:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:37:42):**  think that many people should say that more often, like I'm not an expert, but let's find  
**[0:37:47-0:37:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:37:47):**  a way to tap into sort of the general knowledge or the distributed knowledge that is in the  
**[0:37:53-0:37:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:37:53):**  space.  
**[0:37:54-0:37:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:37:54):**  And there are many ways to do that.  
**[0:37:55-0:37:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:37:55):**  And one of them you mentioned is to see like public experts or that have clearly shown  
**[0:37:59-0:38:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:37:59):**  that they are learning a lot about it because they are listening to certain things or they're  
**[0:38:03-0:38:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:38:03):**  reading, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:38:04-0:38:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:38:04):**  You can verify that in different ways.  
**[0:38:06-0:38:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:38:06):**  And that's not enough because it's nice if they say, if they point to this farm in Berlin  
**[0:38:10-0:38:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:38:10):**  or close to Berlin saying, oh, that's very interesting, but if they don't put any money  
**[0:38:13-0:38:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:38:13):**  on the line, yeah, there's no skin in the game.  
**[0:38:16-0:38:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:38:16):**  So if that's, there are many different ways to do this, but in this case, if they put  
**[0:38:20-0:38:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:38:20):**  in X, then you can match it with Y.  
**[0:38:23-0:38:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:38:23):**  And if enough of them do it, it actually probably has a strong signal that it's not spam.  
**[0:38:27-0:38:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:38:27):**  Like you avoid a lot of the downfalls of a lot of crowdfunding campaigns that don't go  
**[0:38:31-0:38:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:38:31):**  anywhere because it's completely invisible.  
**[0:38:34-0:38:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:38:34):**  Like who's behind it?  
**[0:38:35-0:38:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:38:35):**  Who's actually putting money in?  
**[0:38:36-0:38:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:38:36):**  Who's an expert that knows slightly more about this, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:38:39-0:38:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:38:39):**  And it's very scalable.  
**[0:38:40-0:38:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:38:40):**  I mean, you can repeat that every quarter until let's say the money runs out or money  
**[0:38:44-0:38:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:38:44):**  starts coming back to do that.  
**[0:38:46-0:38:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:38:46):**  And this is how many, many projects at the moment in the blockchain world work, right?  
**[0:38:51-0:38:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:38:51):**  Yeah.  
**[0:38:52-0:38:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:38:52):**  I mean, this niche is particularly suitable for projects which don't have like, when we  
**[0:38:55-0:38:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:38:55):**  talk about the grant domain, of course we can talk about the grant domain, projects  
**[0:38:59-0:39:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:38:59):**  that don't have like any clear monetization ideas for making their own token.  
**[0:39:04-0:39:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:39:04):**  Because of course the other aspect there is, is a, which I will probably also allocate  
**[0:39:08-0:39:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:39:08):**  a part of, if we say $1 billion for would be projects which I see can be enabled as  
**[0:39:14-0:39:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:39:14):**  many other projects, you know, let's look at the, I know you had the, you know, region  
**[0:39:18-0:39:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:39:18):**  network example in here, right?  
**[0:39:19-0:39:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:39:19):**  Christian.  
**[0:39:20-0:39:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:39:20):**  Yeah.  
**[0:39:21-0:39:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:39:21):**  They are sort of launching their own token to launch their own network.  
**[0:39:24-0:39:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:39:24):**  And right now it looks like they're quite successful on doing that.  
**[0:39:27-0:39:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:39:27):**  And they are doing that with specific purpose.  
**[0:39:28-0:39:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:39:28):**  They're on Cosmo, right?  
**[0:39:30-0:39:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:39:30):**  They're on a specific blockchain.  
**[0:39:31-0:39:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:39:31):**  Yeah.  
**[0:39:32-0:39:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:39:32):**  So they're using what's called the tenement, which is like a framework to set up blockchains.  
**[0:39:37-0:39:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:39:37):**  And then that's sort of developed by the guys that also are running what's called cosmos  
**[0:39:41-0:39:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:39:41):**  and cosmos as a way to connect different blockchains.  
**[0:39:44-0:39:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:39:44):**  So if you, if you do what they're doing, it started, you get out getting sort of a, a  
**[0:39:48-0:39:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:39:48):**  quite efficient blockchain that you can set up without having to develop everything yourself.  
**[0:39:53-0:39:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:39:53):**  Then following this cotton protocol, you can then sort of be in trouble with other blockchains.  
**[0:39:57-0:40:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:39:57):**  And that's what was happening in this space too, is when, as you can imagine, first all  
**[0:40:00-0:40:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:40:00):**  these blockchains happens, people make other blockchains.  
**[0:40:02-0:40:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:40:02):**  Now some blockchains are better or geared towards other things than others.  
**[0:40:07-0:40:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:40:07):**  And sometimes it makes sense that that blockchain, you know, which is in their example, sort  
**[0:40:12-0:40:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:40:12):**  of optimized for like existing restoration and like cessation, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:40:19-0:40:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:40:19):**  And that's, you know, that's maybe connected with another blockchain that have another  
**[0:40:22-0:40:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:40:22):**  purpose.  
**[0:40:23-0:40:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:40:23):**  So, so that's what they're doing.  
**[0:40:24-0:40:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:40:24):**  But in that case, what I would mean with, with like my, my sort of enabler statement  
**[0:40:29-0:40:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:40:29):**  would be, well, they also are going to fund a lot of projects.  
**[0:40:34-0:40:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:40:34):**  Now they, they're going to set up in this space sometimes that you really have sort  
**[0:40:38-0:40:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:40:38):**  of a multi-vacator effect there by enabling those projects as well, which are also going  
**[0:40:42-0:40:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:40:42):**  to launch their own tokens.  
**[0:40:44-0:40:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:40:44):**  And these tokens can have very, very different primitives.  
**[0:40:47-0:40:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:40:47):**  And then we got sort of in the, what's called kind of token engineering commons direction,  
**[0:40:52-0:40:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:40:52):**  which is also like a big community that works on how to design such tokens with incentives  
**[0:40:59-0:41:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:40:59):**  or you know, you know, again, what, what, what you want to do.  
**[0:41:03-0:41:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:41:03):**  But that's in that case, you can, you can sort of design specific issuance curves or  
**[0:41:09-0:41:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:41:09):**  exchange curves, or you can do such as every time this currency is exchanged, you know,  
**[0:41:15-0:41:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:41:15):**  10% of the fees are donated to, you know, this restoration project, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:41:21-0:41:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:41:21):**  So just as we have like tokens, it's just like very, very sort of generic, you know,  
**[0:41:29-0:41:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:41:29):**  it can mean a lot of things.  
**[0:41:32-0:41:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:41:32):**  So that's like a big topic we can go into, but yeah.  
**[0:41:35-0:41:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:41:35):**  Maybe for the next time, but I think it's fascinating to just point out that this space  
**[0:41:40-0:41:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:41:40):**  is attracting a lot of people, a lot of very, very smart people.  
**[0:41:44-0:41:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:41:44):**  And in general, again, that's a signaling function.  
**[0:41:47-0:41:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:41:47):**  Like if you see very, very smart people moving into a space that I see actually in the regeneration  
**[0:41:50-0:41:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:41:50):**  space as well from other sectors that leave very good jobs behind or very nice careers,  
**[0:41:55-0:41:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:41:55):**  et cetera, it means something is happening, even though I don't fully understand it.  
**[0:41:59-0:42:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:41:59):**  Maybe nobody does, but you see like it's a signaling function.  
**[0:42:01-0:42:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:42:01):**  If people they've skin in the game because they gave up something else.  
**[0:42:04-0:42:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:42:04):**  And when you look at something like regenetwork, I remember interviewing them and struggling  
**[0:42:08-0:42:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:42:08):**  because I don't really grasp what to even ask.  
**[0:42:11-0:42:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:42:11):**  Like what are metrics?  
**[0:42:12-0:42:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:42:12):**  What is a mental framework we listeners to this podcast should use when we're asking  
**[0:42:18-0:42:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:42:18):**  questions to these kind of coins, tokens, blockchains that claim everything about regeneration  
**[0:42:24-0:42:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:42:24):**  that we possibly want.  
**[0:42:25-0:42:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:42:25):**  But of course, there's a lot of noise out there.  
**[0:42:27-0:42:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:42:27):**  Not saying that regenetwork is noise, but I really struggle with what questions to come  
**[0:42:31-0:42:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:42:31):**  up with because in let's say, quote unquote, normal companies, I can do that.  
**[0:42:35-0:42:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:42:35):**  But in this case, it's really different.  
**[0:42:37-0:42:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:42:37):**  Yeah.  
**[0:42:38-0:42:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:42:38):**  So how I view it is a bit the same as investing sort of in different organizations or giving  
**[0:42:42-0:42:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:42:42):**  like different group of people in organizations like money or investing into them.  
**[0:42:47-0:42:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:42:47):**  There are different stages and at this different stages, let's say it's just like very conservative,  
**[0:42:52-0:42:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:42:52):**  VC, okay.  
**[0:42:54-0:42:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:42:54):**  And maybe there's like pre-product stuff like that.  
**[0:42:56-0:42:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:42:56):**  Very risky stage.  
**[0:42:57-0:42:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:42:57):**  Then there is a product.  
**[0:42:58-0:43:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:42:58):**  And then there, if you are sort of a more short-sighted investor, you're very look it  
**[0:43:03-0:43:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:43:03):**  into like what is the revenue and stuff like that.  
**[0:43:06-0:43:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:43:06):**  And then later on, you're looking at like other things like depending on like maybe  
**[0:43:09-0:43:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:43:09):**  an hour, two years when you have done that A&B round, you want to have, you know, look  
**[0:43:12-0:43:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:43:12):**  for like now, great.  
**[0:43:14-0:43:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:43:14):**  You have all this, all these users.  
**[0:43:16-0:43:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:43:16):**  You have all the turnaround.  
**[0:43:17-0:43:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:43:17):**  Now we want to see a lot of profit, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:43:20-0:43:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:43:20):**  I think how I think about these kind of blockchain startups is it's kind of a bit the same that  
**[0:43:25-0:43:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:43:25):**  you kind of look at different things at different stages, naturally speaking.  
**[0:43:30-0:43:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:43:30):**  So when we are creating products, et cetera, et cetera, and like a very early stage, let's  
**[0:43:34-0:43:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:43:34):**  say some of the checks we maybe give like pre-seed money, you know, maybe they raised  
**[0:43:38-0:43:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:43:38):**  $100,000, you know, with a quite low valuation, something like that, just to get us started.  
**[0:43:44-0:43:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:43:44):**  At that time, well, I think me personally, it's so much about the people, the team, you  
**[0:43:49-0:43:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:43:49):**  believe in it.  
**[0:43:50-0:43:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:43:50):**  Everything they say basically is some kind of vision and that vision can be critical.  
**[0:43:54-0:43:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:43:54):**  And it's a story they're telling like, you know, how most things in society works as  
**[0:43:57-0:43:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:43:57):**  your stories or narrative you tell.  
**[0:43:59-0:44:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:43:59):**  But if they can somehow convince you that that story and vision that they will do and  
**[0:44:03-0:44:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:44:03):**  it kind of sound planned and it makes sense, maybe you can take off in front of you.  
**[0:44:07-0:44:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:44:07):**  Maybe you decide to give them money because you have that feeling based on those metrics.  
**[0:44:10-0:44:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:44:10):**  So that's sort of more when you are like that early, like kind of pre-seed angel, I think  
**[0:44:18-0:44:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:44:18):**  it's fair to say there's a lot of gut feeling intuition on that.  
**[0:44:21-0:44:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:44:21):**  And that's about chemistry with founders.  
**[0:44:22-0:44:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:44:22):**  And some people you can just believe that, you know, what they are saying is possible  
**[0:44:27-0:44:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:44:27):**  or that they have the right to, might want to do it.  
**[0:44:30-0:44:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:44:30):**  And some people just do.  
**[0:44:31-0:44:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:44:31):**  So at that stage, I think that's sort of both traditional companies to start up the production  
**[0:44:36-0:44:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:44:36):**  space that you're looking for.  
**[0:44:37-0:44:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:44:37):**  Then at a later stage, a semester, well, if I would look, let's say, I'm just going to  
**[0:44:43-0:44:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:44:43):**  like a contrast now to the full other aspect and look at blockchains today.  
**[0:44:46-0:44:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:44:46):**  If I want to compare, let's say, Ethereum with like 10 layer, like 13-layer blockchains,  
**[0:44:52-0:44:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:44:52):**  for example, right now, I'm sort of going in that systems that are already live and  
**[0:44:57-0:45:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:44:57):**  they are in this kind of scenario, it's a contrast tool because it's typically not a  
**[0:45:01-0:45:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:45:01):**  typical startup that runs these blockchains because of this big network.  
**[0:45:05-0:45:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:45:05):**  But then just as you have sort of an annual point of view of our company, you have also  
**[0:45:09-0:45:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:45:09):**  a quantitative metrics you can look at the blockchains.  
**[0:45:11-0:45:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:45:11):**  So you can look at like how many users do you have, how many active daily users.  
**[0:45:14-0:45:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:45:14):**  That's the same as you know, if you wanted to invest in Snapchat some years ago before  
**[0:45:18-0:45:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:45:18):**  they have any revenue.  
**[0:45:19-0:45:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:45:19):**  That's how you look at these kinds of software startup too.  
**[0:45:23-0:45:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:45:23):**  Then what you can look at is also like how much gas is actually paid in fees and of course  
**[0:45:28-0:45:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:45:28):**  the percentage of growth in this and the user numbers.  
**[0:45:31-0:45:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:45:31):**  So gas fees is basically the cost that you were mentioning before like to do something  
**[0:45:35-0:45:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:45:35):**  on the blockchain is called gas fees.  
**[0:45:37-0:45:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:45:37):**  And in Ethereum that's been exploding.  
**[0:45:39-0:45:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:45:39):**  And of course, that's a risk.  
**[0:45:41-0:45:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:45:41):**  If you want to do a lot of small transactions, you're not going to pay a huge transaction  
**[0:45:44-0:45:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:45:44):**  fee or infrastructure fee.  
**[0:45:46-0:45:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:45:46):**  But if you are running something like Ethereum and you actually are accumulating, like a  
**[0:45:50-0:45:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:45:50):**  lot of millions of dollars in transaction fees from like millions of users, that also  
**[0:45:54-0:45:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:45:54):**  shows a bit like very new from a startup that shows like, okay, you want to try on something,  
**[0:45:58-0:45:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:45:58):**  right?  
**[0:45:59-0:46:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:45:59):**  So you are providing a service that people want to pay actually a lot for.  
**[0:46:01-0:46:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:46:01):**  So that's like a quantitative metric too.  
**[0:46:03-0:46:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:46:03):**  People are valuing it enough to pay the gas fees.  
**[0:46:06-0:46:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:46:06):**  Yeah.  
**[0:46:07-0:46:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:46:07):**  And in this example, I'm talking about blockchain so that you could talk about like traditional  
**[0:46:10-0:46:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:46:10):**  annual report metrics for companies.  
**[0:46:11-0:46:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:46:11):**  And then this is more kind of network metric you could say.  
**[0:46:14-0:46:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:46:14):**  And then you would also look at, you know, the number of startups, how much have they  
**[0:46:17-0:46:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:46:17):**  raised?  
**[0:46:18-0:46:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:46:18):**  What are they doing?  
**[0:46:19-0:46:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:46:19):**  How many users do they have?  
**[0:46:20-0:46:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:46:20):**  What's built on top of this?  
**[0:46:21-0:46:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:46:21):**  Because blockchain, that's sort of just infrastructure and it's only as good as, especially the ones  
**[0:46:25-0:46:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:46:25):**  which are more generalized computers, what's built on top of it, you know.  
**[0:46:29-0:46:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:46:29):**  This is the new app in B that is built on this blockchain and they have a billion users.  
**[0:46:32-0:46:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:46:32):**  Well, then it's probably worth something, right?  
**[0:46:34-0:46:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:46:34):**  If they sort of build on this infrastructure, maybe there's, you know, also the next Amazon,  
**[0:46:39-0:46:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:46:39):**  maybe there's also the next etc, etc.  
**[0:46:42-0:46:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:46:42):**  So that's definitely something that's interesting too.  
**[0:46:44-0:46:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:46:44):**  And then in these protocols that are now protocols, but it's kind of like apps on top of these  
**[0:46:50-0:46:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:46:50):**  blockchains.  
**[0:46:51-0:46:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:46:51):**  If that's for example, decentralized exchange where you can swap your tokens and there is  
**[0:46:56-0:47:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:46:56):**  a specific volume on that, or there's so much, you know, we have the measure called TVL stands  
**[0:47:02-0:47:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:47:02):**  for total value locked.  
**[0:47:03-0:47:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:47:03):**  And this is when you lock up specific things, assets in a blockchain, maybe for specific  
**[0:47:08-0:47:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:47:08):**  purpose, like a return or something else.  
**[0:47:12-0:47:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:47:12):**  Then that also shows that people have locked some what's up on an app on top of this blockchain.  
**[0:47:18-0:47:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:47:18):**  So that's sort of the, what you can look at it, if you are sort of more investing into  
**[0:47:22-0:47:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:47:22):**  the, or looking at the like larger blockchains.  
**[0:47:24-0:47:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:47:24):**  Then there are all these steps in between where you are early stage product, etc, etc.  
**[0:47:28-0:47:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:47:28):**  And I would just, my understanding is just like going from very like trust, intuition,  
**[0:47:33-0:47:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:47:33):**  or like chemistry in the team base.  
**[0:47:36-0:47:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:47:36):**  And of course, if the team had sold a startup before, that's always like a super good thing.  
**[0:47:40-0:47:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:47:40):**  Or if they get a, you know, it's the best friend from the startup you already invested  
**[0:47:44-0:47:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:47:44):**  into and it's very successful.  
**[0:47:45-0:47:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:47:45):**  That's the same kind of thing with the normal business.  
**[0:47:48-0:47:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:47:48):**  Then you have these different steps on the way where typically as an investor in this  
**[0:47:52-0:47:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:47:52):**  space, well, if there is equity, you want equity, but if there's tokens, you want that  
**[0:47:56-0:47:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:47:56):**  kind of more.  
**[0:47:57-0:48:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:47:57):**  So you want both, if there's both equity and token, if it's a token launched from, you  
**[0:48:01-0:48:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:48:01):**  know, a nonprofit organization, it's fine.  
**[0:48:03-0:48:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:48:03):**  You just get tokens.  
**[0:48:04-0:48:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:48:04):**  But then it depends a bit on like the tokenomics.  
**[0:48:07-0:48:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:48:07):**  Does this token actually add something to the product or is it just like something that  
**[0:48:11-0:48:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:48:11):**  is like, you know, squeezed in there to like make a lot of money very fast?  
**[0:48:18-0:48:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:48:18):**  If it makes the product worse, I would say it's kind of bad token.  
**[0:48:21-0:48:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:48:21):**  If it makes the product or sort of, you know, whatever the startup is doing better and it's  
**[0:48:26-0:48:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:48:26):**  like a fundamental thing for making that thing work, then I think it's very interesting.  
**[0:48:31-0:48:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:48:31):**  And then if it can somehow a true value or there's some element to it, then, well, that's  
**[0:48:37-0:48:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:48:37):**  then we are sort of in the what's called tokenomics aspect.  
**[0:48:40-0:48:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:48:40):**  And then that's very interesting too.  
**[0:48:43-0:48:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:48:43):**  But of course it's just one element like next to, you know, what every startup organization  
**[0:48:48-0:48:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:48:48):**  have in terms of like go to market, getting users, customers, you know, partnerships,  
**[0:48:52-0:48:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:48:52):**  etc, etc.  
**[0:48:53-0:48:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:48:53):**  Yeah.  
**[0:48:54-0:48:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:48:54):**  So very similar in many aspects to what investors might be already used to.  
**[0:48:59-0:49:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:48:59):**  I want to be conscious of your time and ask a final question.  
**[0:49:02-0:49:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:49:02):**  What would you do if you, so you no longer have distributed fund that we talked about  
**[0:49:07-0:49:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:49:07):**  before, but what would you do with a magic wand?  
**[0:49:09-0:49:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:49:09):**  If you could change one thing, but it could be anything, doesn't have to be blockchain  
**[0:49:13-0:49:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:49:13):**  or region, ag or regeneration related, but you had the power to change one thing overnight.  
**[0:49:18-0:49:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:49:18):**  What would you do?  
**[0:49:19-0:49:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:49:19):**  One thing overnight?  
**[0:49:20-0:49:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:49:20):**  Well, I think what is needed and what Bella taught me is that this is mostly about what's  
**[0:49:25-0:49:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:49:25):**  in the head of all of us.  
**[0:49:27-0:49:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:49:27):**  We have actually paradise on earth.  
**[0:49:29-0:49:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:49:29):**  We have the flourishing path here on earth.  
**[0:49:31-0:49:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:49:31):**  So it's more like a thought revolution and working together and collaborating on solving  
**[0:49:35-0:49:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:49:35):**  those basic, you know, problems and serving those basic needs.  
**[0:49:41-0:49:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:49:41):**  We all have natural about like humans here and make sure that with that realization,  
**[0:49:46-0:49:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:49:46):**  we are not destroying the planet, we're not destroying itself, animals, other life beings.  
**[0:49:51-0:49:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:49:51):**  So I think like having that awakening and thought revolution and empathy would be the  
**[0:49:55-0:49:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:49:55):**  single biggest thing.  
**[0:49:56-0:49:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:49:56):**  And I think that would actually solve a lot of problems.  
**[0:49:58-0:50:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:49:58):**  I want to thank you so much, Gustav, for giving us an insight into the fascinating world of  
**[0:50:04-0:50:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:50:04):**  blockchain and everything crypto.  
**[0:50:06-0:50:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:50:06):**  And probably not the last time, there's so much happening in that space and obviously  
**[0:50:09-0:50:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:50:09):**  in all the spaces that are surrounded.  
**[0:50:11-0:50:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:50:11):**  And I think we're going to see a lot of much more practical applications of these models  
**[0:50:16-0:50:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:50:16):**  over the next year slash years.  
**[0:50:18-0:50:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:50:18):**  And we'll be coming back to explain them to us and to see what to how we should put these  
**[0:50:23-0:50:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:50:23):**  very, very powerful.  
**[0:50:25-0:50:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:50:25):**  Let's not underestimate this at all.  
**[0:50:27-0:50:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:50:27):**  Very powerful tools to work.  
**[0:50:28-0:50:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:50:28):**  Sure.  
**[0:50:29-0:50:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:50:29):**  Yeah.  
**[0:50:30-0:50:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:50:30):**  Thanks a lot.  
**[0:50:31-0:50:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:50:31):**  Very happy to be here.  
**[0:50:32-0:50:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:50:32):**  Share my knowledge.  
**[0:50:33-0:50:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:50:33):**  Happy to get in touch, answer further questions.  
**[0:50:34-0:50:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:50:34):**  And also want to thank you, Korn, for your great work on summoning leading experts in  
**[0:50:39-0:50:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:50:39):**  this field around the world and coordinating here, because I think that that's really leading

**[0:52:04-0:52:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:52:04):**  and recording these podcasts since 2016 we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.

**[0:53:06-0:53:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:53:06):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.

**[0:53:33-0:53:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:53:33):**  So you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:53:34-0:53:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:53:34):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:53:40-0:53:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:53:40):**  is so risky.  
**[0:53:41-0:53:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:53:41):**  How to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to invest  
**[0:53:45-0:53:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:53:45):**  in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find if  
**[0:53:50-0:53:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:53:50):**  you're a soil builder.  
**[0:53:51-0:53:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:53:51):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:53:56-0:54:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:53:56):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:54:00-0:54:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:54:00):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:54:05-0:54:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:54:05):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:54:06-0:54:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:54:06):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:54:08-0:54:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:54:08):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:54:10-0:54:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:54:10):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:54:14-0:54:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:54:14):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:54:16-0:54:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/gustav-friis#t=0:54:16):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.

**[0:00:12-0:00:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:00:13):**  A conversation about scale and business and the key role of decentralized processing in  
**[0:00:18-0:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:00:18):**  regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:00:19-0:00:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:00:19):**  Our guest has launched an investment firm, first investing their own capital into accelerating  
**[0:00:23-0:00:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:00:23):**  regenerative farming.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:00:25):**  If the food grown with regenerative practices doesn't taste amazing, and if it doesn't  
**[0:00:29-0:00:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:00:29):**  take more money, we will never reach the impact we need.  
**[0:00:34-0:00:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:00:34):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture, investing as if  
**[0:00:39-0:00:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:00:39):**  the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:40-0:00:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:00:40):**  A podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:45-0:00:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:00:45):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:00:50-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:00:50):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:00:54):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:57-0:01:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:00:57):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:00-0:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:01:00):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:01:03):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:08-0:01:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:01:08):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:12-0:01:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:01:12):**  In March last year, we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support

**[0:01:52-0:01:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:01:52):**  Hey, thanks.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:01:53):**  Thanks for having me.  
**[0:01:54-0:01:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:01:54):**  To start with a personal question, why soil?  
**[0:01:57-0:02:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:01:57):**  What does an Irish man ends up in Texas working on regenerative agriculture?  
**[0:02:01-0:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:02:01):**  Well, that's a good question.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:02:03):**  I think I don't know how far back you want me to go, but we, uh, when we, you know, my  
**[0:02:07-0:02:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:02:07):**  business partner Lou and I started looking, we both have a passion for farming.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:02:10):**  I can talk about that if you like, but when we started looking at it and getting a bit  
**[0:02:13-0:02:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:02:13):**  more interested in, should we do something here?  
**[0:02:16-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:02:16):**  You know, why is, why is food quality getting worse?  
**[0:02:20-0:02:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:02:20):**  Even real food quality getting worse.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:02:21):**  You know, why are Westernized economies as they get more money, why does the health go  
**[0:02:25-0:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:02:25):**  down and obesity go up and diabetes go up?  
**[0:02:27-0:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:02:27):**  And now that we've kind of dug into the space, you realize, you know, it's actually, it's  
**[0:02:31-0:02:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:02:31):**  Michael Pollan's great line.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:02:32):**  It's not why you eat, it's what you eat ate and you dig a little bit deeper in there.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:02:37):**  And I'm sure you've done this yourself and realize, oh, well, it's not just the quality  
**[0:02:39-0:02:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:02:39):**  of what they eat.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:02:40):**  It's how it's grown.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:02:41):**  And ultimately it all boils back to the soil.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:02:44):**  If the soil is no good, the crops, the grains, the grass are not going to be any good.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:02:49):**  And it's logical when you think of it.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:02:50):**  It's just, you know, I probably had never gone quite there before.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:02:52):**  And when you realize, okay, it's all about the soil.  
**[0:02:55-0:02:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:02:55):**  And then, you know, you dig a little deeper and realize, oh, well, that UN stats of that,  
**[0:02:59-0:03:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:02:59):**  we have 65 harvests left.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:03:00):**  Obviously that's a big number to show out there and not true in every part of the world.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:03:04):**  But what it is quite scary how much topsoil we're eroding and how our practices are just  
**[0:03:09-0:03:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:03:09):**  making it worse and worse.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:03:10):**  And then when you dig in a little more and realize, oh, there's, there's this regenerative  
**[0:03:14-0:03:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:03:14):**  agriculture thing.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:03:15):**  It's easier on the land.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:03:17):**  It's got less inputs for the farmers, so it should be a more profitable business.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:03:20):**  And it restores soil, takes carbon from the atmosphere and makes higher nutrient quality  
**[0:03:24-0:03:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:03:24):**  or nutrient dense food.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:03:25):**  And it's not mainstream.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:03:27):**  So kind of, you know, as you dig and dig and dig in, you realize this is a real opportunity  
**[0:03:31-0:03:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:03:31):**  and need.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:03:33):**  And is there something we can do here?  
**[0:03:34-0:03:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:03:34):**  And we looked around and talked to some farmers and we believe there is, and it's great that  
**[0:03:38-0:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:03:38):**  there's more and more people doing it.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:03:39):**  And hopefully it can be a little bit of help.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:03:41):**  And the analysis of the broken food system and obviously the potential of regenerative  
**[0:03:46-0:03:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:03:46):**  agriculture, many would share, but you didn't stop there.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:03:49):**  You went into action mode, but let's ask a question first to you.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:03:52):**  So was there one moment you suddenly saw the potential or was it more a gradual process?  
**[0:03:57-0:04:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:03:57):**  Yeah, I'd love to say there's a light bulb moment, but I think I'm always, you know,  
**[0:04:03-0:04:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:04:03):**  I'm from Ireland obviously.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:04:04):**  And I spend all my summers and holidays on family farms and my business partner Lou has  
**[0:04:08-0:04:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:04:08):**  a ranch here.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:04:09):**  And so, you know, we started, I always had an idea that at some point I'd run a farm  
**[0:04:13-0:04:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:04:13):**  even if it was a hobby project or something in my retirement and, you know, the more I  
**[0:04:16-0:04:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:04:16):**  started looking into it and Dan Barber's book, The Third Plate is just fascinating.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:04:20):**  As someone who likes food, forget farming, it's fascinating.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:04:23):**  And you look at, you know, I love the approach he takes, which is all about the quality and  
**[0:04:27-0:04:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:04:27):**  taste for consumers.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:04:28):**  And I actually, we can talk about that later, but I think that's really important.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:04:31):**  And I think that's what drives this movement to a degree.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:04:34):**  And then Michael Pollan's book, The Omnivore's Dilemma introduced me to Joel Salatin.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:04:37):**  I read Joel Salatin and then Dave Brown.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:04:39):**  And so I do think it was a gradual progression from an interest to a hobby to a, maybe there's  
**[0:04:43-0:04:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:04:43):**  a business here too.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:04:44):**  Oh, there's a whole ecosystem.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:04:46):**  And, you know, and even now I'm kind of semi nervous going on a podcast because the more  
**[0:04:51-0:04:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:04:51):**  you dig, every time you look at one article, there's 10 more links and 10 more people and  
**[0:04:55-0:04:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:04:55):**  10 more funds and 10 more companies.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:04:57):**  And so this space for better or for worse, is much deeper than I thought, which is, you  
**[0:05:01-0:05:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:05:01):**  know, that's obviously better, but worse that so few people know about it.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:05:05):**  And there is, you know, it is such an active micro community, but it's not mainstream.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:05:09):**  It's not even close.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:05:10):**  I don't even know if it's on that path yet.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:05:12):**  And I think that's where we need to work on.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:05:13):**  And because maybe many would have stopped there, started their own farm, maybe bring  
**[0:05:18-0:05:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:05:18):**  forward their retirement a bit and would do that and would stop at that.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:05:22):**  And obviously maybe advocate for things, et cetera.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:05:24):**  But you decided to take a different approach, bringing a lot of your knowledge that you  
**[0:05:28-0:05:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:05:28):**  have in other spaces, mostly technology to this space.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:05:31):**  Can you describe a bit that decision, like you saw the opportunity and then didn't decide  
**[0:05:34-0:05:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:05:34):**  to create your own piece of paradise, but actually said, okay, this is something I want  
**[0:05:38-0:05:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:05:38):**  to work in and spend a lot of my awake hours.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:05:41):**  Yeah, there probably was a semi-lightbulb moment on that front.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:05:44):**  And, you know, obviously I'd love to have a farm and I'm sure I will at some point,  
**[0:05:47-0:05:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:05:47):**  but we talked to a lot of farmers and they all said to us, you know, we need guys like  
**[0:05:52-0:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:05:52):**  you, we need business people in this space.  
**[0:05:54-0:05:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:05:54):**  We're great at making food.  
**[0:05:55-0:05:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:05:55):**  And I think, you know, farmers all go to farmers markets to sell direct and I'm not sure that's  
**[0:05:58-0:06:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:05:58):**  necessarily what they all love to do.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:06:00):**  I think it's, you know, chefs are great at making food, but are they all great at running  
**[0:06:02-0:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:06:02):**  restaurants?  
**[0:06:03-0:06:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:06:03):**  And I think farmers, independent farmers have to do that, but I don't know what they'd choose  
**[0:06:07-0:06:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:06:07):**  to do if there was a better route to market.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:06:09):**  And we just heard this, it's, you know, we need business people.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:06:11):**  And so when we look at the whole ecosystem, it's not just, I mean, there are lots of small  
**[0:06:15-0:06:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:06:15):**  farmers and there are more and more people moving to regenerative.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:06:18):**  And so meeting on that will be a great hobby and hopefully I'll do it and I'll love it,  
**[0:06:21-0:06:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:06:21):**  but I'm a business person first and I do see the opportunity and I'm passionate about it.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:06:26):**  And I think I'd like to think that Lou and I can bring what we've done in scale works  
**[0:06:29-0:06:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:06:29):**  in the last five or six years and in our business careers, we can have an impact here and look,  
**[0:06:34-0:06:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:06:34):**  we're business junkies.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:06:35):**  We love business.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:06:36):**  If we bring our love of business to a space where there's a real mission and we can see  
**[0:06:40-0:06:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:06:40):**  a real impact of regenerative agriculture succeeding, then we should.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:06:44):**  And can you describe a bit what is scale works?  
**[0:06:46-0:06:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:06:46):**  So we said scale works up, I mean, you can probably guess where the Soilworks name came  
**[0:06:50-0:06:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:06:50):**  from, very original.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:06:51):**  So we set scale works up six years ago because in the software space we saw that there was  
**[0:06:55-0:07:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:06:55):**  a lot of great product companies being built, being built by engineers and funded by VCs.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:07:01):**  And they had great products, but not great routes to market, not great scalable leadership  
**[0:07:05-0:07:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:07:05):**  teams, scalable sales and marketing.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:07:07):**  And I think a lot of times founders, especially engineer founders, they love building and  
**[0:07:11-0:07:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:07:11):**  that's great.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:07:12):**  They love building and then they get to a point and it's a rare founder who's good at  
**[0:07:16-0:07:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:07:16):**  building and scaling.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:07:17):**  And so in scale works we acquire as close to 100% of a company as we can, always a majority  
**[0:07:23-0:07:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:07:23):**  or almost always a majority and bring in a new leadership team, grow the team, focus  
**[0:07:28-0:07:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:07:28):**  on a scalable sales and marketing strategy.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:07:30):**  So we've bought, I don't know, eight or 10 companies in the last five years and thankfully  
**[0:07:35-0:07:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:07:35):**  it's gone well.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:07:36):**  And you were planning and are planning and are actually doing that partly with the acquisition  
**[0:07:40-0:07:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:07:40):**  of FasterMap, that approach to regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:07:43):**  Yeah, I don't know that that was our day one plan, but it worked out pretty well.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:07:47):**  It's a good bridge from the software world to the regenerative agricultural world by  
**[0:07:51-0:07:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:07:51):**  acquiring a software company.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:07:52):**  So we know the software space well.  
**[0:07:54-0:07:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:07:54):**  Lou was actually a user of FasterMap and he connected with the original founders and we  
**[0:07:59-0:08:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:07:59):**  realized, look, this is a really small business, but we think FasterMap is a big opportunity,  
**[0:08:04-0:08:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:08:04):**  not just in, I mean, obviously rotational grazing and pasture management is a huge part  
**[0:08:09-0:08:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:08:09):**  of regenerative agriculture, but I feel like that's the kind of the entryway and having  
**[0:08:15-0:08:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:08:15):**  acres that we help farmers manage, hopefully there's a lot more we can do over time as  
**[0:08:19-0:08:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:08:19):**  we work with those farmers.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:08:20):**  And look, we know how to do software.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:08:23):**  We were quickly able to build a software team around it and hopefully we can build out the  
**[0:08:26-0:08:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:08:26):**  platform, but hopefully it's a, that's the entryway for us to connect with farmers and  
**[0:08:29-0:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:08:29):**  figure out how we can do more on soil, more on carbon and, you know, generally, you know,  
**[0:08:34-0:08:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:08:34):**  build out our, our network and learnings there.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:08:37):**  And because you acquired the full company of FasterMap and have changed the team as  
**[0:08:42-0:08:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:08:42):**  they were moving on and otherwise I think FasterMap would have closed and you were interested  
**[0:08:46-0:08:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:08:46):**  that that didn't happen.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:08:48):**  So what are you changing with them or what's the next phase in this case for a software  
**[0:08:51-0:08:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:08:51):**  company that you've bought completely?  
**[0:08:53-0:08:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:08:53):**  Well, yeah, we bought it completely.  
**[0:08:54-0:08:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:08:54):**  I hope it wouldn't have closed.  
**[0:08:56-0:08:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:08:56):**  I don't know, but it was like, it wasn't, it wasn't a massively loss making business.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:08:59):**  It's a small business, but it had a, you know, tiny team.  
**[0:09:03-0:09:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:09:03):**  So the founders have moved on.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:09:05):**  There was only, I think really one other employee and she stayed with us and she's great and  
**[0:09:09-0:09:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:09:09):**  doing a phenomenal job and hopefully having lots of fun.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:09:11):**  So we've added four people to five people to the team since we bought it.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:09:15):**  And look, step one is, you know, the low hanging fruit, talk to our customers, what's the stuff  
**[0:09:20-0:09:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:09:20):**  you're frustrated with.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:09:21):**  And that list is always long.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:09:22):**  And so we don't need to be business geniuses to pick up the low hanging fruit and fix the  
**[0:09:27-0:09:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:09:27):**  problems that people tell us they've had or they have.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:09:30):**  And then look, you know, it's a privilege to have those conversations and outside of  
**[0:09:35-0:09:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:09:35):**  hearing the kind of immediate things they have is ask what they're doing on their farm.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:09:39):**  What else can we do to help?  
**[0:09:40-0:09:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:09:40):**  And then, you know, ask what are, you can see the ideas.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:09:45):**  Would you like us to do more on cover cropping?  
**[0:09:47-0:09:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:09:47):**  You know, can we help you manage that?  
**[0:09:49-0:09:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:09:49):**  Would you like to do more on soil metering?  
**[0:09:50-0:09:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:09:50):**  Do you have soil meters?  
**[0:09:51-0:09:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:09:51):**  Would you like to input your data in there?  
**[0:09:53-0:09:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:09:53):**  You know, can we figure out how much carbon is being removed into the soil and sell carbon  
**[0:09:58-0:09:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:09:58):**  credits?  
**[0:09:59-0:10:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:09:59):**  I think there's just look, there's lots to do in the short term, which is just kind of  
**[0:10:02-0:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:10:02):**  stick to your knitting and make what we do really solid, better and grow us, you know,  
**[0:10:07-0:10:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:10:07):**  and Pasture Map gets a ton of signups all the time, which is great.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:10:10):**  So it's our job to make sure that we work with all those, all those customers or potential  
**[0:10:13-0:10:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:10:13):**  customers and do a good job getting them on board and getting their pastures set up and  
**[0:10:18-0:10:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:10:18):**  then go from there.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:10:19):**  And look, the community already knows way, way more than we do.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:10:21):**  So it's our job to kind of listen and then prioritize the things you hear lots of times  
**[0:10:26-0:10:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:10:26):**  that we can actually do.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:10:27):**  So how would you describe Soilworks then as an entity or as a concept?  
**[0:10:32-0:10:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:10:32):**  How would you describe it?  
**[0:10:33-0:10:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:10:33):**  I guess it's look, it's a, it's an investment entity or company.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:10:38):**  Look, our mission is to accelerate the transition to regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:10:43-0:10:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:10:43):**  And so we'll, within reason, anything we can add value in will do.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:10:49):**  I think there's, you know, there's lots of, there's lots of funds and big funds emerging  
**[0:10:54-0:10:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:10:54):**  in this space, or at least big funds who are now adding agricultural regenerative agriculture  
**[0:10:58-0:11:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:10:58):**  to their, to their thesis.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:11:01):**  So I hope we're not, you know, we're not just a investor of money.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:11:05):**  But if we can add value by acquiring a company like Pasture Map and bringing our, our, you  
**[0:11:09-0:11:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:11:09):**  know, our expertise of running businesses to it, if we can start a company, I think  
**[0:11:12-0:11:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:11:12):**  we'll, I think we'll start one or two in the next year.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:11:15):**  We're somewhat in progress already.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:11:17):**  And if we can invest in some companies where, you know, we can bring a business community  
**[0:11:21-0:11:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:11:21):**  together and hopefully accelerate them.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:11:23):**  And I think, you know, the power of bringing a small network together could be great.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:11:26):**  So we'll, I think Soilworks is our kind of vehicle to do that.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:11:30):**  Hopefully, we'll build a little bit of a brand and that'll attract, you know, smart people  
**[0:11:34-0:11:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:11:34):**  and we can, you know, start having good conversations.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:11:37):**  And so far, it's been funded by you and your business partner.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:11:40):**  Are there any plans to take on outside capital and to put other people's capital to work  
**[0:11:45-0:11:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:11:45):**  as well?  
**[0:11:46-0:11:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:11:46):**  I should probably have some disclaimers.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:11:48):**  We're not actually raising the fund now, but if we were, I guess we'd have to do that.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:11:50):**  So yeah, I think we will.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:11:52):**  I think we will.  
**[0:11:53-0:11:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:11:53):**  I mean, our capital is not limitless, obviously.  
**[0:11:56-0:12:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:11:56):**  You know, my gut right now is that we'll be, like ScaleWorks, we'll always stay kind of  
**[0:12:00-0:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:12:00):**  boutique size where we can actually have an impact.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:12:03):**  But you never know.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:12:04):**  I mean, this space, I think, especially as farmers have to figure out how to migrate  
**[0:12:09-0:12:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:12:09):**  and transition, that could take a lot of money.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:12:11):**  So if the funds, if the other funds exist, great.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:12:14):**  I don't think, you know, we don't want to compete with anyone on just dollars in the  
**[0:12:17-0:12:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:12:17):**  bank.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:12:18):**  But yes, I think at some point we'll have to raise money and we'll figure out, will  
**[0:12:20-0:12:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:12:20):**  it be a fund or will it be a company?  
**[0:12:22-0:12:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:12:22):**  And I don't know the answer to that yet, but I think we'll do something.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:12:25):**  Yeah.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:12:26):**  And I like to ask this prioritization question, which I always have to explain a bit.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:12:30):**  Using the ITN framework, which is importance, tractability and the lignactiveness, which  
**[0:12:34-0:12:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:12:34):**  I always struggle with.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:12:36):**  It's definitely inspired by the effective altruism community that uses it a lot.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:12:40):**  I will put a link in the show notes below if you want to know more, but it really looks  
**[0:12:43-0:12:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:12:43):**  at importance, like what is the scale of the problem, tractability, how solvable is it  
**[0:12:48-0:12:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:12:48):**  and how many other people are working on it in a sense, like how much of a difference  
**[0:12:50-0:12:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:12:50):**  can you make?  
**[0:12:51-0:12:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:12:51):**  If you had to describe your approach to investing in and obviously being an entrepreneur in  
**[0:12:57-0:13:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:12:57):**  regenerative agriculture and food, how would you rank it that?  
**[0:13:00-0:13:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:13:00):**  Like, how would you, basically, why did you choose this approach if you would look at  
**[0:13:04-0:13:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:13:04):**  those, those parts?  
**[0:13:05-0:13:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:13:05):**  You know, it's funny when you think about importance, go back to the macro, there's  
**[0:13:09-0:13:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:13:09):**  no more important space.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:13:10):**  I mean, regenerative agriculture helps our climate and our food system.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:13:14):**  And is there any two bigger problems we have right now than world health and nutrition  
**[0:13:18-0:13:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:13:18):**  obviously being such a big precursor to that and environmental change?  
**[0:13:22-0:13:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:13:22):**  And your approach in that in terms of bringing that business mind and the scalability or  
**[0:13:27-0:13:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:13:27):**  the repeatability as well to the region X space where we are now, will that solve a  
**[0:13:33-0:13:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:13:33):**  lot of the issues that we are all having in terms of that still it's a super tiny sector  
**[0:13:38-0:13:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:13:38):**  and we're sort of fighting for attention everywhere?  
**[0:13:40-0:13:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:13:40):**  Well, look, I actually think one of the, I wouldn't say issues, but one of the neglected  
**[0:13:45-0:13:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:13:45):**  areas so far within the space is that the community is, you know, talks a lot about  
**[0:13:51-0:13:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:13:51):**  it and is getting better and better at the practices of regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:13:54-0:13:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:13:54):**  But I'm a believer that supply follows demand.  
**[0:13:57-0:14:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:13:57):**  And right now I think demand for regenerative produce is, you know, it might not be zero,  
**[0:14:02-0:14:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:14:02):**  but it's pretty low because consumers don't know what it is.  
**[0:14:05-0:14:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:14:05):**  And if you look at, you know, consumer awareness, I mean, the big trend changes, consumer awareness  
**[0:14:10-0:14:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:14:10):**  of the importance of nutrition and high quality food is growing and growing.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:14:15):**  Right.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:14:16):**  And, you know, you look at just the growth of organic and as we all know, organic isn't  
**[0:14:19-0:14:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:14:19):**  necessarily great for the environment or, you know, might be better than the opposite  
**[0:14:22-0:14:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:14:22):**  method, but it's still not perfect.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:14:24):**  And so it's a good start.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:14:25):**  It's a start.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:14:26):**  Yeah, I think.  
**[0:14:27-0:14:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:14:27):**  And in terms of consumer awareness, everybody knows organic.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:14:29):**  They've done a really good job.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:14:31):**  We've all done a good job in that.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:14:33):**  And I think, I think if we could get regenerative produce or whatever it becomes called to that  
**[0:14:37-0:14:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:14:37):**  level of awareness, then supply will follow demand, more and more farmers will do it,  
**[0:14:41-0:14:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:14:41):**  more and more farmers will migrate.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:14:42):**  And so, so what are your plans there?  
**[0:14:44-0:14:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:14:44):**  Because you mentioned we're going to start one or two companies.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:14:46):**  I'm guessing now that they're going to be in the food space.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:14:49):**  I don't know.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:14:50):**  I have some I'm not going to share yet.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:14:52):**  Next podcast.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:14:53):**  But I don't want to jinx us.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:14:54):**  So I don't know, maybe we'll support companies in the consumer space.  
**[0:14:57-0:15:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:14:57):**  I mean, have you seen some in like the food as medicine, the nutrient density, because  
**[0:15:02-0:15:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:15:02):**  it's such a complex story.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:15:04):**  I see a lot of opportunity there.  
**[0:15:05-0:15:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:15:05):**  I absolutely believe that the key to getting consumer demand is going to be nutrient density,  
**[0:15:09-0:15:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:15:09):**  health care, etc.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:15:11):**  I haven't seen too many examples yet.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:15:13):**  Definitely without anybody listening that has them.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:15:15):**  But that like food companies that are built around healthy soils, just very simply.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:15:20):**  Have you seen some little examples yet?  
**[0:15:22-0:15:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:15:22):**  Like are we getting there?  
**[0:15:23-0:15:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:15:23):**  No, I wish we were.  
**[0:15:24-0:15:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:15:24):**  I think this is just such a small space.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:15:26):**  I mean, look, the farmers markets, an example.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:15:28):**  Of course.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:15:29):**  But there so there you don't know unless you have the bioneutrient meter, then get rich,  
**[0:15:32-0:15:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:15:32):**  which isn't ready yet, because there's no database around.  
**[0:15:35-0:15:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:15:35):**  You cannot really see which tomato has been grown in healthy soils.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:15:38):**  Exactly.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:15:39):**  And so, you know, you can go online to your local farmer.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:15:41):**  But look, the average consumer, even the average educated consumer about the importance of  
**[0:15:45-0:15:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:15:45):**  nutrition is not going to do that.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:15:46):**  And it's just it's not it's not easy to get regenerative produce.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:15:50):**  And then you got to ask the question, I mean, again, within the regenerative space, is regenerative  
**[0:15:54-0:15:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:15:54):**  produce, is that what consumers want?  
**[0:15:56-0:15:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:15:56):**  I mean, will the consumer care that you're regenerating your land?  
**[0:15:59-0:16:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:15:59):**  I mean, it's great for the environment and the macro view of this food is good for, you  
**[0:16:03-0:16:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:16:03):**  know, it helps someone restore their soil.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:16:05):**  But is it good for me?  
**[0:16:06-0:16:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:16:06):**  I mean, did this come from good soil or soil that was just started regenerating a month  
**[0:16:09-0:16:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:16:09):**  ago?  
**[0:16:10-0:16:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:16:10):**  And so I don't know the answers to those.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:16:12):**  But I think until those questions are asked and we start once we start getting regenerative  
**[0:16:16-0:16:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:16:16):**  produce in front of consumers, just like in the soft world, they will tell us what works  
**[0:16:20-0:16:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:16:20):**  and what doesn't.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:16:21):**  And we can adapt on the fly.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:16:22):**  But, you know, when you when you talk when I talk to a friend or colleague or family  
**[0:16:25-0:16:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:16:25):**  member about regenerative agriculture, they just gloss over it.  
**[0:16:29-0:16:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:16:29):**  No idea what that is.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:16:31):**  And the exciting part is when you explain it, everyone is fascinated by it.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:16:34):**  Then they start kind of their own cognitive bias of, oh, I saw I recognised this.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:16:38):**  Is it, you know, was there a conference about this?  
**[0:16:40-0:16:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:16:40):**  Is this person speaking about it?  
**[0:16:41-0:16:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:16:41):**  But then someone says, you know, where can I get this food?  
**[0:16:44-0:16:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:16:44):**  And there's no answer to that yet.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:16:45):**  And so there's no good answer to it.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:16:47):**  So how would you approach that?  
**[0:16:48-0:16:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:16:48):**  I mean, you are now in soil works, obviously, but as nutrient density is so key and it's  
**[0:16:54-0:16:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:16:54):**  such a horrible word.  
**[0:16:55-0:17:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:16:55):**  What would be the steps there to fastly iterate a minimal viable product, like bringing the  
**[0:17:00-0:17:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:17:00):**  software spirit and work ethics and approach to that?  
**[0:17:05-0:17:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:17:05):**  How would that look like if we apply that to nutrient density?  
**[0:17:07-0:17:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:17:07):**  Well, I kind of think of it as a pyramid of sorts.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:17:10):**  I think the top of the pyramid is taste.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:17:13):**  I think, you know, people don't want to have medicine.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:17:17):**  Medicine tastes horrible because if it tasted good, you wouldn't believe it would make you  
**[0:17:19-0:17:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:17:19):**  any better.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:17:20):**  And so I think number one is taste.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:17:22):**  You know, it has to taste.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:17:23):**  By the way, real food should taste great.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:17:25):**  It should taste the best.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:17:26):**  And so I think Dan Barber is such a good steward of this community because he goes straight  
**[0:17:31-0:17:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:17:31):**  to I'm going to make the best food for consumers.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:17:34):**  And so regenerative produce should be the most tasty food.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:17:38):**  It should also be the most nutrient dense.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:17:40):**  And so as a buyer for my family, not just a kind of restaurant goer, you look and say,  
**[0:17:45-0:17:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:17:45):**  well, if I'm in the store, I want something that's really nutrient dense and that the  
**[0:17:48-0:17:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:17:48):**  kids are going to like.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:17:50):**  And then I think the third part is, oh, this was carbon negative.  
**[0:17:54-0:17:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:17:54):**  Awesome.  
**[0:17:55-0:17:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:17:55):**  I'm so great about this.  
**[0:17:56-0:17:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:17:56):**  I mean, I'm eating meat, which, you know, the world has been telling me is bad for me,  
**[0:17:59-0:18:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:17:59):**  but actually is really good for me.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:18:00):**  It's super nutrient dense.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:18:02):**  I mean, nothing more I can give my kids is so packed with nutrients.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:18:06):**  And it's carbon negative.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:18:07):**  Wow, I feel awesome.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:18:08):**  And so I think there are lots of kind of, you know, step one, two, three that I think,  
**[0:18:13-0:18:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:18:13):**  look, we'll see.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:18:14):**  We'll see what consumers react to.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:18:15):**  But you know, you want to get out there and start getting them to react.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:18:17):**  I think that's the approach.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:18:19):**  Test, test, test and see, I mean, real people that put money on the table, either as customers  
**[0:18:25-0:18:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:18:25):**  for a faster map or as consumers in a shop.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:18:28):**  I mean, that's the often what goes, goes wrong as well.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:18:31):**  Like people develop things in their silo somewhere and the world needs you idea, but then you  
**[0:18:36-0:18:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:18:36):**  get out and nobody cares about what you develop.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:18:38):**  So getting that minimum viable and getting into real markets, I think is key.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:18:44):**  And what would you say like to smart, I would say smart investors, let's say they're all  
**[0:18:49-0:18:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:18:49):**  listening to this show.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:18:50):**  You've made your first steps, actually your first investments in the space.  
**[0:18:54-0:18:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:18:54):**  What would you tell them, obviously, without giving investment advice, all the disclaimers  
**[0:18:57-0:19:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:18:57):**  here are true to look out for, to look into in terms of regenerative agriculture as you've  
**[0:19:02-0:19:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:19:02):**  been going down the rabbit hole?  
**[0:19:03-0:19:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:19:03):**  It's a good question.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:19:05):**  The caveat being that advising smart investors assumes that we're smart investors.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:19:09):**  So the extra disclaimer that we might, we may not be in, we're just getting started  
**[0:19:13-0:19:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:19:13):**  ourselves.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:19:14):**  So I think when you look ag tech, especially in Silicon Valley, you say, oh, ag tech, we're  
**[0:19:19-0:19:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:19:19):**  investing in ag tech.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:19:20):**  And it's, it's our last hundred years of ag tech and the industrialization of agriculture  
**[0:19:25-0:19:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:19:25):**  have been about getting more from less scale, scale, scale, more from less, more chemicals  
**[0:19:29-0:19:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:19:29):**  for more produce.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:19:30):**  And I think it has to be the opposite of that.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:19:32):**  You know, it can't be more from less, you know, obviously we don't want less, but you  
**[0:19:37-0:19:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:19:37):**  know what our current, you know, all the ag tech we're doing now in software for precision  
**[0:19:42-0:19:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:19:42):**  agriculture.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:19:43):**  I just, I just think it's the wrong, it's the wrong way.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:19:46):**  It's just making us worse.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:19:47):**  And so what we need to do is ag tech, you know, that the, the, the investments in agriculture  
**[0:19:52-0:19:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:19:52):**  need to be on the process and innovation and methodology and logistical side.  
**[0:19:56-0:20:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:19:56):**  I mean, this whole ecosystem, if regenerative agriculture is going to succeed, really needs  
**[0:20:00-0:20:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:20:00):**  to be rebuilt.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:20:01):**  We need to go from massively centralized to massively decentralized.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:20:04):**  And so, you know, how do we change the regulations there to allow that?  
**[0:20:08-0:20:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:20:08):**  How do we support many small businesses?  
**[0:20:10-0:20:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:20:10):**  How do we build scalable logistics chains that are super decentralized?  
**[0:20:14-0:20:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:20:14):**  You know, I think if there's one positive of the current, you know, world health crisis,  
**[0:20:19-0:20:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:20:19):**  it's that we've seen centralized food systems don't work.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:20:21):**  And so maybe, maybe that that'll be an accelerator.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:20:23):**  And so, look, I would just say that things that might not traditionally look like scalable  
**[0:20:29-0:20:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:20:29):**  software investments that are very attractive, I think investors need to look at, you know,  
**[0:20:34-0:20:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:20:34):**  what is the investment ecosystem we can do here?  
**[0:20:36-0:20:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:20:36):**  And it shouldn't just be more from less, which is the, which is what has got us into this  
**[0:20:40-0:20:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:20:40):**  problem to begin with.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:20:41):**  And I mean, this is a question that maybe is very relevant in a couple of years, but  
**[0:20:44-0:20:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:20:44):**  what if you be in charge of a one billion dollar investment fund?  
**[0:20:48-0:20:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:20:48):**  How would you break that down and how would you, or maybe not maybe put everything in  
**[0:20:52-0:20:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:20:52):**  one thing?  
**[0:20:53-0:20:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:20:53):**  What would you do with that starting today?  
**[0:20:55-0:20:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:20:55):**  I almost want to say that I wouldn't want that.  
**[0:20:57-0:21:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:20:57):**  I mean, I'm not convinced that big dollars make big change.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:21:00):**  I think, you know, we see that in the software world all the time.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:21:03):**  You know, the more money companies raise is definitely not a predictor of their success.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:21:08):**  I mean, just look at the innovator, Selena, right?  
**[0:21:10-0:21:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:21:10):**  I mean, small companies that innovate big companies all the time.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:21:13):**  And so I'm not, I actually think, you know, constraints are a great, great, great driver  
**[0:21:18-0:21:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:21:18):**  of innovation.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:21:19):**  I think, you know, I saw the software farmers are super constrained financially, I'm like  
**[0:21:23-0:21:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:21:23):**  everything else and look at how scrappy and innovative they are and getting there, they're  
**[0:21:26-0:21:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:21:26):**  making their farms work.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:21:28):**  And so if I have to have a, that much money to spend, I think one, you know, you could  
**[0:21:33-0:21:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:21:33):**  put a lot of it into just the, how do you finance the transition and the migration?  
**[0:21:37-0:21:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:21:37):**  I know you're doing some, some work on this as it is.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:21:39):**  And so, you know, how do we give, you know, since the government isn't doing it yet, how  
**[0:21:43-0:21:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:21:43):**  do you, how do you help farmers move from regenerative or from, from conventional to  
**[0:21:47-0:21:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:21:47):**  regenerative?  
**[0:21:48-0:21:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:21:48):**  And then, look, you know, that's a big fun.  
**[0:21:51-0:21:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:21:51):**  So I draw the stack of what is the ecosystem in agriculture.  
**[0:21:55-0:22:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:21:55):**  And then I think within each set, each, each, the current food system from, from farmer  
**[0:22:00-0:22:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:22:00):**  to consumer, every step along the way is likely to have to change or likely to change.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:22:05):**  And hopefully, you know, getting the farmer closer to the consumer.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:22:08):**  So outside of quality, the farmer makes more money.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:22:10):**  I think that, you know, the consumer doesn't necessarily have to pay more.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:22:13):**  Right.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:22:14):**  That'd be a nice win win.  
**[0:22:15-0:22:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:22:15):**  And so I think you could look at each part of that ecosystem or that, you know, food  
**[0:22:19-0:22:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:22:19):**  system stack or agri-food system stack and there's innovation going to happen in each  
**[0:22:22-0:22:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:22:22):**  area.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:22:23):**  And so, you know, if you had that much money, you could maybe have lots of little microphones  
**[0:22:26-0:22:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:22:26):**  and a poor fuel on each area.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:22:29):**  Is there something in all of the different stacks, like basically from farm to fork to  
**[0:22:33-0:22:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:22:33):**  plate at the end, something you find most interesting or most exciting at the moment,  
**[0:22:39-0:22:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:22:39):**  because obviously that could change in six months or two months, et cetera.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:22:41):**  Is there something or you recently discovered that you didn't see or know, because every,  
**[0:22:45-0:22:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:22:45):**  I agree, every little piece has to change.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:22:47):**  So it's also difficult to choose where to focus on and what to learn because they're  
**[0:22:50-0:22:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:22:50):**  so different from slaughtering to sending to shipping to processing to growing.  
**[0:22:55-0:22:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:22:55):**  I mean, it's all different industry, basically, and all very complex.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:22:58):**  Is there something that caught your eye recently in one of those stacks that really excites  
**[0:23:03-0:23:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:23:03):**  you?  
**[0:23:04-0:23:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:23:04):**  Yeah.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:23:05):**  I mean, I think processing is a big area.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:23:06):**  I mean, you know, like centralized processing, it makes, you know, it's semi-uneconomical  
**[0:23:11-0:23:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:23:11):**  or untenable really for farmers to compete because they can't get access to centralized  
**[0:23:15-0:23:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:23:15):**  processing plants, which means they can't get that economy of scale.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:23:18):**  They have to go to smaller local state producers who are vastly more expensive.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:23:23):**  So the meat's just more expensive, full stop, straight away, nothing to do with quality  
**[0:23:26-0:23:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:23:26):**  or anything else.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:23:28):**  And it's only sellable within state lines.  
**[0:23:31-0:23:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:23:31):**  And so I think, you know, decentralized processing.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:23:35):**  So, you know, many, many small plants and mobile processing on farm, you know, so animals  
**[0:23:40-0:23:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:23:40):**  never have to even get into a truck, which is, you know, one, good for their quality  
**[0:23:44-0:23:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:23:44):**  of life and two, the quality of meat is often predicted by the stress of an animal.  
**[0:23:48-0:23:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:23:48):**  So less stress is going to be good from the top of the pyramid, bit of taste.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:23:52):**  And so, you know, while that's technically possible, you want to be able to sell, you  
**[0:23:55-0:24:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:23:55):**  know, across state lines and lots of grocery stores will only take USDA inspected.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:24:00):**  And so how and I don't know how innovation helps here because technically it's possible.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:24:04):**  But how do we lobby or get the USDA to change their approach that they'll allow inspections  
**[0:24:09-0:24:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:24:09):**  over, you know, camera or some other, you know, some other way of doing it, that they  
**[0:24:13-0:24:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:24:13):**  don't have to have a person implant, which just makes the barrier to massively decentralized  
**[0:24:17-0:24:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:24:17):**  processing too high and too expensive.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:24:19):**  Yeah.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:24:20):**  Just to give a bit of background in many of these plants, especially the large centralized  
**[0:24:23-0:24:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:24:23):**  ones obviously are closed right now or partly closed because of COVID because they turned  
**[0:24:27-0:24:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:24:27):**  out to be a hotbed and there always needs to be a USDA person onsite when you slaughter.  
**[0:24:34-0:24:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:24:34):**  But of course, if you have a very small mobile slaughter unit that travels from farm to farm,  
**[0:24:39-0:24:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:24:39):**  it just doesn't make any economic sense that there is a person they are paid by the slaughter  
**[0:24:43-0:24:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:24:43):**  house to see every single animal.  
**[0:24:45-0:24:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:24:45):**  But still you need that in terms of getting into the larger contracts and they need to  
**[0:24:50-0:24:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:24:50):**  be USDA approved.  
**[0:24:51-0:24:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:24:51):**  So there's this quadrant basically that makes that technically possible, but practically  
**[0:24:56-0:24:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:24:56):**  not feasible yet.  
**[0:24:57-0:25:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:24:57):**  But of course, maybe in the current situation, there could be movement because with pressure,  
**[0:25:02-0:25:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:25:02):**  everything becomes fluid if it's big enough of an issue.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:25:05):**  Well, of course, if you actually did get, you know, a massively decentralized processing  
**[0:25:10-0:25:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:25:10):**  or mobile processing units across the states or across the world, let's say across the  
**[0:25:13-0:25:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:25:13):**  US, then the selling across state lines wouldn't really matter because every state produces  
**[0:25:19-0:25:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:25:19):**  enough meat anyway.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:25:21):**  So by and large, you'd be able to do it that way.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:25:23):**  So that's one interesting area, I think.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:25:25):**  And OK, so we're taking away your one billion dollar investment fund, which you didn't want  
**[0:25:29-0:25:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:25:29):**  in the first place.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:25:30):**  That is OK.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:25:31):**  Yeah.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:25:32):**  But we give you a magic wand and the magic power to change one thing in actually the  
**[0:25:35-0:25:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:25:35):**  larger agriculture industry.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:25:37):**  What would you do?  
**[0:25:38-0:25:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:25:38):**  Well, I mean, look, the easy answer is just ban all chemicals, maybe give a three year  
**[0:25:41-0:25:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:25:41):**  kind of approach to ban all chemicals.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:25:44):**  But I think if I had a magic wand, I think all consumers know what regenerative light  
**[0:25:48-0:25:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:25:48):**  is right now and understand it.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:25:49):**  And then I think demand would drive supply.  
**[0:25:51-0:25:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:25:51):**  And they will start knocking on the door of anywhere where they buy the current food and  
**[0:25:54-0:25:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:25:54):**  start asking questions on soil health, etc.  
**[0:25:56-0:25:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:25:56):**  Yeah.  
**[0:25:57-0:26:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:25:57):**  And look, the other thing is, I mean, as a consumer, I think if I had a magic wand, you  
**[0:26:01-0:26:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:26:01):**  want on both sides, supply and demand, especially on investment side, to focus on quality, not  
**[0:26:05-0:26:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:26:05):**  quantity.  
**[0:26:06-0:26:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:26:06):**  I mean, I said that before, I guess, but we've been 100 years of quantity.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:26:10):**  Does anyone really believe we have a quantity issue with the amount of food waste?  
**[0:26:13-0:26:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:26:13):**  I mean, I just we don't have a quantity issue.  
**[0:26:15-0:26:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:26:15):**  We have a quality issue.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:26:16):**  And I think every study said is that we can make enough quality food with regenerative  
**[0:26:21-0:26:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:26:21):**  practices that and that would solve so many problems.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:26:24):**  And so if every side of the stakeholder table from producer, supplier and consumer realized  
**[0:26:29-0:26:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:26:29):**  quality matters, I think, you know, we wouldn't necessarily have to pay a lot more because  
**[0:26:32-0:26:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:26:32):**  that scale, I think we can make that work and that would change the world massively.  
**[0:26:37-0:26:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:26:37):**  We keep coming back to scale.  
**[0:26:38-0:26:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:26:38):**  It's also a bit of a, I wouldn't say dirty word, but some people are scared of scale  
**[0:26:42-0:26:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:26:42):**  because you get once we're scaling this regenerative agriculture movement, we lose some of the  
**[0:26:46-0:26:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:26:46):**  complexity, etc., etc.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:26:48):**  What would you say to that?  
**[0:26:49-0:26:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:26:49):**  I think that it shouldn't scale, it should all be small scale, family run farms and it  
**[0:26:54-0:26:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:26:54):**  should actually all be smaller.  
**[0:26:56-0:26:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:26:56):**  I think that that can be scaled.  
**[0:26:58-0:26:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:26:58):**  I don't think it has to be big farms.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:26:59):**  I mean, look at Uber.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:27:00):**  Uber is a massive company, but it's super decentralized.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:27:05):**  All they are is Airbnb or take any of these.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:27:08):**  They have a central purchasing platform that connects you or a central platform that connects  
**[0:27:12-0:27:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:27:12):**  the consumer to the supplier.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:27:14):**  Right.  
**[0:27:15-0:27:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:27:15):**  In which case, you know, sometimes it's me and I want to get it right to the airport.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:27:17):**  But why can't we do that for farmers?  
**[0:27:18-0:27:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:27:18):**  I mean, why doesn't scale doesn't necessarily mean centralization, especially in the current  
**[0:27:24-0:27:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:27:24):**  world we live in where on my mobile phone I can open up an app and I can order online  
**[0:27:28-0:27:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:27:28):**  or order from a farmer or have a central store that connects me to local farmers and they  
**[0:27:32-0:27:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:27:32):**  deliver the next day.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:27:33):**  I don't know what the solution should be, but I think I absolutely think we should have  
**[0:27:38-0:27:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:27:38):**  loads of small farms.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:27:39):**  I don't think big farms, I think big farms that always have a weird, you know, a weird  
**[0:27:43-0:27:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:27:43):**  kind of diseconomy of scale will kick in at some point.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:27:47):**  And maybe it is my own passion because I like my family are small farmers and I'd like to  
**[0:27:51-0:27:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:27:51):**  be a farmer too.  
**[0:27:52-0:27:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:27:52):**  But I think we can.  
**[0:27:53-0:27:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:27:53):**  I'd love to see, you know, I think 100 years ago farmers were wealthy and that now farmers  
**[0:27:58-0:28:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:27:58):**  go bankrupt at a scary rate.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:28:01):**  And so many farmers have off farm jobs.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:28:04):**  I mean, what a joke.  
**[0:28:05-0:28:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:28:05):**  The most important thing for our health and world is that we can eat.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:28:07):**  I mean, you know, regardless of the quality of food we have to eat and the people producing  
**[0:28:11-0:28:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:28:11):**  our food are treated so badly and make so little money.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:28:13):**  I mean, it's ridiculous.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:28:14):**  And so I think, yeah, I think we can, we can scale the logistics, which means we can have  
**[0:28:20-0:28:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:28:20):**  lots of small suppliers, right?  
**[0:28:22-0:28:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:28:22):**  So I do believe that decentralized farming can scale and regenerative from scale because  
**[0:28:28-0:28:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:28:28):**  you need less inputs.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:28:29):**  I mean, the wonderful thing about it is you don't need all the chemicals.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:28:33):**  So you can be a regenerative farmer at any size and hopefully make money because your,  
**[0:28:37-0:28:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:28:37):**  you know, your input cost goes way down.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:28:39):**  Hopefully the quality of your output goes up.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:28:41):**  Maybe the volume goes up a little bit and maybe the price you get goes up either because  
**[0:28:44-0:28:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:28:44):**  of the quality or because you've removed so many parts of the, you know, so many middlemen  
**[0:28:48-0:28:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:28:48):**  from the chain.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:28:49):**  So anyway, long answer, but, but I think this absolutely can scale, but it can scale, you  
**[0:28:54-0:28:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:28:54):**  know, by billions of suppliers.  
**[0:28:55-0:29:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:28:55):**  And I love to ask this question that is definitely inspired by John Kempf, but what do you believe  
**[0:29:00-0:29:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:29:00):**  to be true about regenerative agriculture that others don't?  
**[0:29:02-0:29:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:29:02):**  It could be the scale one, but it could also be a completely different one.  
**[0:29:05-0:29:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:29:05):**  What do you believe to be true that others in regenerative agriculture don't believe  
**[0:29:08-0:29:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:29:08):**  to be true?  
**[0:29:09-0:29:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:29:09):**  I feel like it's such a leap of overconfidence to say, I'm not a regenerative producer myself.  
**[0:29:14-0:29:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:29:14):**  We've been in this space for maybe learning it for two or three years and saying that  
**[0:29:18-0:29:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:29:18):**  there's something that, I mean, every day you learn something new.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:29:20):**  So look, if I had to pick something, I'd say it is that business is not evil.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:29:25):**  Regenerative agriculture, it's great that, you know, there should be a fair price and  
**[0:29:28-0:29:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:29:28):**  that, you know, uh, ethics of the, of how we treat animals and farmers are there.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:29:32):**  But this, this, it has to be a business, right?  
**[0:29:34-0:29:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:29:34):**  This isn't a philanthropic project.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:29:36):**  Regenerative farmers have to make money.  
**[0:29:38-0:29:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:29:38):**  Farmers have to get high quality food that they demand that they're prepared to pay for.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:29:41):**  And so, you know, I don't know if that's something that people debate or not, but if they do,  
**[0:29:44-0:29:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:29:44):**  then that's my, that's my one belief.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:29:46):**  Oh, they definitely do.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:29:48):**  But is there a reason why you picked being a public benefit company and not a foundation  
**[0:29:52-0:29:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:29:52):**  or basically a non-profit?  
**[0:29:53-0:29:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:29:53):**  Yeah.  
**[0:29:54-0:29:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:29:54):**  I mean, I don't think that's even a question.  
**[0:29:56-0:29:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:29:56):**  I mean, like the question was, are we, are we a company or a public benefit company?  
**[0:29:59-0:30:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:29:59):**  A public benefit company is a far profit company that has a mission outside of, of just, of  
**[0:30:05-0:30:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:30:05):**  just creating, creating wealth.  
**[0:30:06-0:30:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:30:06):**  And so, but a foundation or a, or a philanthropy has, you know, they give away money and I  
**[0:30:12-0:30:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:30:12):**  mean, giving away money, it'll help farmers move maybe, but, but how is that going to  
**[0:30:16-0:30:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:30:16):**  create sustainable long-term businesses?  
**[0:30:18-0:30:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:30:18):**  If, if we can't make money at this and we think we're not going to scale it, it's as  
**[0:30:23-0:30:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:30:23):**  simple as that.  
**[0:30:24-0:30:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:30:24):**  If consumers don't want it and love it, they're not going to buy it.  
**[0:30:26-0:30:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:30:26):**  And if they do, people, more and more farmers are going to move to it and then new people  
**[0:30:29-0:30:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:30:29):**  look into it and then other parts of the ecosystem will change.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:30:32):**  I mean, I think, I think trying to make this a kind of altruistic, let's say, you know,  
**[0:30:36-0:30:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:30:36):**  don't worry about making money.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:30:37):**  We'll just make great stuff.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:30:38):**  We'll never work.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:30:39):**  You know, the best way to, to, I won't say beat, but the best way to force the food system  
**[0:30:44-0:30:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:30:44):**  to change outside of consumer demand is by business, right?  
**[0:30:48-0:30:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:30:48):**  I mean, like this, there should be profit all the way along and farmers should make  
**[0:30:51-0:30:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:30:51):**  more money than they have ever before.  
**[0:30:53-0:30:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:30:53):**  And so I absolutely think this has to be driven by business.  
**[0:30:55-0:30:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:30:55):**  Which I think is a good answer to that question.  
**[0:30:59-0:31:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:30:59):**  I think that definitely not, I mean, many would agree listening to this and some probably  
**[0:31:02-0:31:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:31:02):**  weren't.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:31:03):**  So I think it's a really good answer to the question.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:31:05):**  And I want to thank you for your time.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:31:07):**  I think we covered a lot.  
**[0:31:09-0:31:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:31:09):**  I don't think it's the last time we talked because I think there's as you're so, I wouldn't  
**[0:31:13-0:31:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:31:13):**  say fresh in this space, but new at least to be public about this.  
**[0:31:16-0:31:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:31:16):**  I mean, you've just bought Pastrum app.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:31:18):**  You're revitalizing a lot of things.  
**[0:31:19-0:31:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:31:19):**  And from the sound of it, you're going to start one or two companies this year, which  
**[0:31:23-0:31:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:31:23):**  I'm very interested in, but whenever that, that is shareable and open, I would love to  
**[0:31:27-0:31:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:31:27):**  check in and see because I'm super interested in the food as medicine or the tasty food  
**[0:31:32-0:31:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:31:32):**  side of things and the consumer side of things, because I think there's the key to, it flips  
**[0:31:36-0:31:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:31:36):**  the question to, okay, if we all start asking for this on a large scale, farmers will change  
**[0:31:42-0:31:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:31:42):**  and the whole food system will change.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:31:43):**  And that's a very interesting insight.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:31:44):**  So thank you for that.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:31:45):**  So totally agree.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:31:46):**  Look forward to chatting again.

**[0:34:30-0:34:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:34:30):**  We're gonna look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture

**[0:34:51-0:34:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:34:51):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:34:55-0:35:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:34:55):**  We're gonna look at nutrient density, landscape design, and a lot more.

**[0:35:01-0:35:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:35:01):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:35:03-0:35:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:35:03):**  Unfortunately, that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:35:06-0:35:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:35:06):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:35:09-0:35:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/08/25/ed-byrne#t=0:35:09):**  It's also not investment advice.

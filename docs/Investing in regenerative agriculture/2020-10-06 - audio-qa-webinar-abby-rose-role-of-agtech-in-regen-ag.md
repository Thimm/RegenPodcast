**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  
**[0:00:05-0:00:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:00:05):**  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com or in the links below.  
**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:00:14):**  We'll start sharing my screen for a very brief presentation and then we're going to open  
**[0:00:20-0:00:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:00:20):**  it up to Abby to share a lot of interesting things.  
**[0:00:29-0:00:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:00:29):**  So first of all, welcome to Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food.  
**[0:00:32-0:00:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:00:32):**  It's a podcast show we've been hosting for the last three and a half years.  
**[0:00:37-0:00:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:00:37):**  And we've been, especially since COVID, hosting webinars as well.  
**[0:00:41-0:00:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:00:41):**  We've been hosting smaller Q&A webinars, Ask Me Anything webinars, basically to try to  
**[0:00:47-0:00:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:00:47):**  bring the community together and allow you to ask the questions that I did not ask, which  
**[0:00:52-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:00:52):**  are always a lot.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:00:54):**  So very briefly, we're obviously today are at the Q&A with Abby Rose, who is on the  
**[0:00:59-0:01:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:00:59):**  call.  
**[0:01:00-0:01:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:01:00):**  As you can see, we've interviewed her a while ago.  
**[0:01:02-0:01:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:01:02):**  I think it's about a year and a few months ago.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:01:05):**  And I'm very curious on how things are going because I know a lot has changed.  
**[0:01:09-0:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:01:09):**  So we'll get into that soon.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:01:11):**  And she's a fellow podcaster as well.  
**[0:01:13-0:01:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:01:13):**  She's the co-host of PharmaNama.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:01:14):**  So it's very nice to have her here.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:01:17):**  This we already discussed.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:01:18):**  And basically what we've so far done is interviewed probably over 90 and we're getting close to  
**[0:01:23-0:01:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:01:23):**  the 100 interviews with investors, farmers, scientists, fund managers, anybody in the  
**[0:01:28-0:01:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:01:28):**  space to scale, to grow, to replicate regenerative agriculture and food.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:01:34):**  And basically trying to answer that question, how to put money to work in regenerating soil  
**[0:01:38-0:01:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:01:38):**  at scale.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:01:39):**  And not because I think putting money to work is such an amazing thing.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:01:44):**  I think we are literally running out of soil and running out of time.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:01:48):**  And money and finance seems to be the tool that we can use to speed it up.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:01:53):**  It seems to be the tool we can use to destroy a lot of things.  
**[0:01:56-0:02:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:01:56):**  But it seems to be also the tool when put to work properly and appropriately, it seems  
**[0:02:01-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:02:01):**  to be able to speed up a lot of things.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:02:04):**  And if there's one thing we need, it's definitely speed up.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:02:08):**  So if you haven't been listening to the podcast, you can find it in any podcast app.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:02:12):**  Just search for investing in regenerative agriculture, which has a very simple name.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:02:15):**  One of the things we did well at the beginning.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:02:19):**  So just for anybody who's on the call who is scratching their head and think what is  
**[0:02:23-0:02:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:02:23):**  regenerative agriculture, it's probably contrary to the term regenerative agriculture to come  
**[0:02:29-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:02:29):**  up with the definition.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:02:30):**  I found a nice description of it.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:02:33):**  It's definitely any farmer that is deep into regenerative agriculture will tell you it's  
**[0:02:36-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:02:36):**  a journey.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:02:37):**  They're never done.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:02:38):**  They're always, next year I want to experiment with that.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:02:39):**  I want to go further there.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:02:40):**  I want to play with that.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:02:42):**  It's not a zero or one like you either are or not.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:02:45):**  No, it's a journey.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:02:46):**  It's a lot of steps and it really is place and it's context specific, but it's probably  
**[0:02:52-0:02:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:02:52):**  a system of farming principles and practices that increases biodiversity, enriches soils,  
**[0:02:57-0:02:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:02:57):**  improves watersheds and enhances ecosystem services.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:02:59):**  So if you want to boil it down, it's a farming system.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:03:02):**  It's a system of principles that builds soil.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:03:05):**  And if you are discussing with farmers that are doing this, they will probably talk more  
**[0:03:08-0:03:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:03:08):**  about the soil than the produce they actually grow and sell, which is quite interesting  
**[0:03:12-0:03:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:03:12):**  or about the earthworms.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:03:13):**  I mean, there's a lot around it.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:03:16):**  I went up and to just make it a bit visual, you can basically, what is the difference  
**[0:03:22-0:03:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:03:22):**  between regenerative and sustainable?  
**[0:03:24-0:03:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:03:24):**  Sustainable as the word says it basically wants to sustain a current system.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:03:27):**  And I think we can all agree that the current agriculture system is pretty, and food system  
**[0:03:31-0:03:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:03:31):**  is pretty broken.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:03:32):**  So why would we want to sustain it?  
**[0:03:34-0:03:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:03:34):**  And we need to go, we want to go, and it's a much more positive movement to actually  
**[0:03:38-0:03:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:03:38):**  go beyond and restore, regenerate soils to begin with, but people, planet, obviously  
**[0:03:44-0:03:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:03:44):**  fallen from that.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:03:45):**  And most of the current agriculture system is very extractive.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:03:48):**  And if you want to see more of that, I will show some followup basically, if you want  
**[0:03:53-0:03:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:03:53):**  to dig deeper on that.  
**[0:03:55-0:03:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:03:55):**  I love this degenerative to regenerative, obviously the colors are nice as well.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:03:58):**  Comes from an article that Ethan Soloviev wrote in 2011 already.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:04:04):**  I will definitely, I urge you if you haven't read it to find it on Medium.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:04:08):**  And I will show another picture from that one soon, but basically this shows the, it's  
**[0:04:13-0:04:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:04:13):**  a continuum.  
**[0:04:14-0:04:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:04:14):**  It's never done.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:04:15):**  There's no easy yes or no answer.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:04:17):**  But you see some practices that come back a lot, which are the soil should always be  
**[0:04:21-0:04:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:04:21):**  covered.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:04:22):**  They're complex rotations, although there are some arguments about that as well.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:04:25):**  But monoculture seem to be very, very tricky doing in a way that makes sense for the soil.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:04:31):**  Very limited or no tilling and the integration of animals, which some people really favor  
**[0:04:36-0:04:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:04:36):**  and some other people less, but there's, there seems to be a consensus that somehow for especially  
**[0:04:42-0:04:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:04:42):**  advanced regenerative agriculture, that somehow animals are integrated into the rotations.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:04:46):**  If we then eat them or not, that's a separate discussion.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:04:50):**  But it seems to be, there's a lot of actually movement happening in regenerative agriculture  
**[0:04:53-0:04:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:04:53):**  livestock space.  
**[0:04:55-0:05:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:04:55):**  This is a super way too busy slide from Ethan Soloviev, the continuum.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:05:01):**  It's very nice.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:05:02):**  I've seen investors use this actually to send it to a company they're talking to and ask  
**[0:05:05-0:05:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:05:05):**  the farmer in this case, the company was a farm to, to grade themselves basically to  
**[0:05:11-0:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:05:11):**  not, not take any position.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:05:12):**  This is good or bad, but okay.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:05:14):**  If you look at your farm, where would you see yourself?  
**[0:05:16-0:05:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:05:16):**  And they basically would put dots on the different characteristics, inputs and practices.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:05:21):**  So just to show, if you want to see some of these frameworks, they're out there to find.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:05:26):**  It's not a zero or one question.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:05:28):**  You either are or not.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:05:29):**  So it's definitely a continuum.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:05:31):**  If you want to dig deeper, I can highly recommend the article of Ethan, a number of books, Kiss  
**[0:05:36-0:05:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:05:36):**  the Ground, Growing Revolution, Dirty Soils, very interesting.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:05:39):**  They're amazing YouTube channels.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:05:41):**  Abby knows a lot of them as well.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:05:43):**  They're amazing podcasts, I wouldn't say ours, but definitely a lot of farmer focused ones.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:05:47):**  If you really want to dig deeper into the soil side of things and the farmer side of  
**[0:05:50-0:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:05:50):**  things and obviously our website as well.  
**[0:05:54-0:05:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:05:54):**  So with that, I would love to, I will switch off the sharing because it's just annoying  
**[0:05:59-0:06:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:05:59):**  and basically want to point it to Abby to basically ask to give an update on VEDA cycle.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:06:08):**  And first of all, welcome obviously.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:06:10):**  Thanks for having me again, Koen.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:06:14):**  And great to be here with everyone.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:06:17):**  Welcome.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:06:18):**  And I guess, well, I know that Koen shared kind of the last interview or podcast that  
**[0:06:27-0:06:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:06:27):**  we did together.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:06:28):**  Some of you may have already heard a bit about our company, but I'll give you a little brief  
**[0:06:33-0:06:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:06:33):**  overview in that VEDA cycle, my parents moved to Chile.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:06:39):**  I'm based in the UK.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:06:40):**  My parents moved to Chile about 15 years ago now and they started farming.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:06:47):**  And that was really the first time I'd ever considered that farming was of interest in  
**[0:06:51-0:06:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:06:51):**  my life.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:06:52):**  I'm ashamed to say.  
**[0:06:55-0:07:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:06:55):**  And it was kind of through being on the farm and recognizing the challenges of farming.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:07:03):**  We are farming organically.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:07:06):**  We started to realize I have a background in physics.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:07:09):**  I studied physics at university and I learned to code.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:07:13):**  And I started to realize that actually I could create some quite simple apps that could really  
**[0:07:17-0:07:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:07:17):**  support managing our farm at the scale that we were operating in.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:07:22):**  And this was back in like 2014.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:07:25):**  So there weren't that many small scale farming apps or regenerative farming apps around.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:07:30):**  And so that's really where we started.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:07:33):**  And so today VEDA cycle apps, we have a few different apps that we offer.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:07:42):**  And I guess the update really from where we last were is that we've broken out one of  
**[0:07:47-0:07:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:07:47):**  the apps or yeah, we've separated out the apps and kind of rebranded.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:07:51):**  One of our apps is called Soil Mentor and another one is called Sector Mentor.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:07:57):**  And I think I've been thinking a lot about what brings all the apps together and really  
**[0:08:02-0:08:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:08:02):**  at the core of everything we do, it's really speaking to what Koen just talked about, which  
**[0:08:07-0:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:08:07):**  is that really the farmer is the expert on their farm.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:08:12):**  To me that is in regenerative agriculture that kind of has to be true.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:08:17):**  Like every single farm is different.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:08:19):**  So you, the farmer has to be the expert for their farm.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:08:23):**  And in order to enable that and to promote that, observation and monitoring is really,  
**[0:08:28-0:08:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:08:28):**  really key to that so that you can learn as you go, try new things, see what works, what  
**[0:08:33-0:08:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:08:33):**  didn't and really have your eye in for what looks good and what doesn't.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:08:37):**  And so that observation being the core, that's the basis of all of our apps essentially.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:08:44):**  And so how do we make those observations more powerful and how can we help farmers build  
**[0:08:51-0:08:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:08:51):**  on those observations year over year and really learn as they go.  
**[0:08:56-0:08:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:08:56):**  So that's what-  
**[0:08:57-0:09:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:08:57):**  Can you describe the, because for the people that didn't listen to the podcast, how this  
**[0:09:01-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:09:01):**  started?  
**[0:09:02-0:09:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:09:02):**  Because it really came from a lack of observation and challenges there simply because of the  
**[0:09:08-0:09:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:09:08):**  relatively large size of the farm, if I remember correctly.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:09:11):**  Yeah.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:09:12):**  We had eight, we had unfortunately, yeah, we had 8,000 olive trees.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:09:16):**  That's where it started.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:09:17):**  And we were going out and observing the trees to try and understand how to best manage them.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:09:24):**  It was actually particularly around frost.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:09:27):**  Some of them were getting frost damage, others weren't.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:09:29):**  And it was unclear if it was the same tree year after year that was just, you know, maybe  
**[0:09:33-0:09:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:09:33):**  just a weak tree, a bad spot, and we just need to take the tree out.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:09:38):**  Or was it actually like every year it was a bit random?  
**[0:09:41-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:09:41):**  You know, with 8,000 trees, you can't remember those kinds of things.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:09:46):**  So that was where we started.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:09:47):**  And we put, in that case, we put NFC tags or contactless tags on every single tree so  
**[0:09:55-0:09:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:09:55):**  that you can just take your phone, go up, scan the tag.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:09:58):**  It tells you the whole history of that tree.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:10:00):**  And you can add photos and also add any new activities you're doing.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:10:08):**  And so it's in this way that we started to build up a real picture of how each tree was  
**[0:10:11-0:10:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:10:11):**  doing and where we were having, you know, where we needed to focus if there was going  
**[0:10:16-0:10:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:10:16):**  to be a frost event to really look after trees better.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:10:20):**  Unfortunately for us, we had a super fire come through in January 2017.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:10:27):**  And so that's something that obviously there's nothing you can do about it.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:10:32):**  And so we lost 90% of our trees at that point.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:10:36):**  So we have replanted.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:10:40):**  But not all olive trees actually.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:10:42):**  That was an important learning for us is that diversity really is key.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:10:47):**  And so we have a mix of nuts and fruits and olives now.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:10:53):**  But yeah, really that observation is where it started.  
**[0:10:56-0:10:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:10:56):**  And what we moved into is we also have some vines.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:10:59):**  And so we make sector mentor mainly for vineyards.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:11:03):**  So we work with a number of vineyards in the UK and some of the best regenerative vineyards  
**[0:11:07-0:11:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:11:07):**  in the US who are like super inspiring.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:11:12):**  And it's interesting that in the vineyard world, it's already a very well established  
**[0:11:16-0:11:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:11:16):**  practice.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:11:17):**  The observation is the key to having a well managed vineyard.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:11:22):**  And so there the adoption of observation has been very quick or the adoption of using technology  
**[0:11:27-0:11:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:11:27):**  to support observation has been very rapid.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:11:31):**  And yeah, so we have a number of vineyards using our app like every day all the time  
**[0:11:36-0:11:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:11:36):**  to keep track of what's going on out in the vines and to learn from year on year trends  
**[0:11:41-0:11:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:11:41):**  what works best in their particular vineyard to build soil health, diversity and to improve  
**[0:11:50-0:11:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:11:50):**  their harvests and the quality of their grapes.  
**[0:11:54-0:11:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:11:54):**  And then on the soil side of things, that's very much so soil mentor is very much focused  
**[0:11:59-0:12:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:11:59):**  on being able to go out and do very simple tests that don't require any expensive equipment.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:12:07):**  So literally getting a spade or a shovel and digging a hole and then how many earthworms  
**[0:12:13-0:12:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:12:13):**  are in that spade full?  
**[0:12:15-0:12:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:12:15):**  How does the soil fall apart when you put it in water?  
**[0:12:19-0:12:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:12:19):**  And we have systems of grading that so that you can actually see, last year I went to  
**[0:12:26-0:12:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:12:26):**  that specific GPS location and I found that the soil got a six in water.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:12:34):**  This year I've gone back, I had put a cover crop in and I started grazing animals in between.  
**[0:12:39-0:12:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:12:39):**  How has the soil changed when I put it in water?  
**[0:12:43-0:12:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:12:43):**  And so our app allows you to take photos, to record the results and then start to see  
**[0:12:47-0:12:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:12:47):**  those trends over time clearly.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:12:50):**  And I'd say, so we just started working with a lady called Nicole Masters of Integrity  
**[0:12:54-0:12:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:12:54):**  Soils in New Zealand and she's a real inspiration.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:12:59):**  So that's really exciting for us to be kind of the technology partner for what she's doing.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:13:04):**  And I'd say she is kind of one of the world leading experts in this very physical soil  
**[0:13:11-0:13:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:13:11):**  observation as the way for farmers to understand their regenerative journey and to really see  
**[0:13:16-0:13:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:13:16):**  how they're moving forward into a more regenerative mindset and a more regenerative agriculture  
**[0:13:21-0:13:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:13:21):**  practice.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:13:23):**  And then what else have we, we also, yeah, since we last spoke on, we've introduced biodiversity  
**[0:13:30-0:13:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:13:30):**  monitoring alongside it so that farmers can, as they're out and about, start to monitor  
**[0:13:36-0:13:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:13:36):**  what it is they're seeing and where.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:13:38):**  Because that also is part of this whole picture of understanding how the ecology is all kind  
**[0:13:43-0:13:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:13:43):**  of fitting together and then fostering it.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:13:48):**  And then the final thing I wanted to just share is that we've also, so we did some work  
**[0:13:53-0:14:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:13:53):**  with a group here in the UK who's not particularly regenerative agriculture focused called NIAB.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:14:00):**  But it's the lady, a soil health expert in this case, a soil health scientist called  
**[0:14:06-0:14:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:14:06):**  Liz Stockdale.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:14:07):**  And what we worked with her on that was very interesting for me was we took lab results,  
**[0:14:13-0:14:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:14:13):**  some more conventional soil testing lab tests.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:14:16):**  And then we started to put alongside that some of these visual tests.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:14:19):**  So like there's a visual evaluation of soil structure framework and an earthworm count  
**[0:14:25-0:14:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:14:25):**  framework.  
**[0:14:27-0:14:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:14:27):**  And we started to kind of put those tests alongside the nitrogen phosphate readings  
**[0:14:34-0:14:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:14:34):**  so that farmers can start to see the value of those readings.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:14:39):**  They are just as valuable as soil tests, those kinds of observations.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:14:43):**  And then we also made it all kind of easy to benchmark against scientific benchmarks,  
**[0:14:49-0:14:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:14:49):**  but also against other farmers in the farming groups.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:14:53):**  And I think that that's a really exciting way forward because again, it's really allowing  
**[0:14:59-0:15:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:14:59):**  the farmers to become the experts through this kind of co-learning and farming groups.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:15:04):**  So they can compare to scientific benchmarks if they like, but also they can start to see,  
**[0:15:10-0:15:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:15:10):**  oh, you know, that field I visited last week at Martha's farm, how does that compare to  
**[0:15:17-0:15:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:15:17):**  my field and why was that better?  
**[0:15:19-0:15:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:15:19):**  Oh, she does this practice.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:15:21):**  And so it's that kind of in-field learning you might call it.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:15:26):**  So that was kind of my update.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:15:28):**  A lot has happened and in general, I mean, the ag tech space seems to not have slowed  
**[0:15:35-0:15:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:15:35):**  down since we talked.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:15:37):**  I mean, the interest is pouring in, the money is pouring in.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:15:41):**  And what as an insider and a bit outsider observer, what have you seen there that excites  
**[0:15:48-0:15:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:15:48):**  you and maybe also a part that worries you?  
**[0:15:51-0:15:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:15:51):**  Yeah.  
**[0:15:52-0:16:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:15:52):**  So I think there are some really exciting things going on.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:16:00):**  I've mainly seen it in the US actually.  
**[0:16:03-0:16:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:16:03):**  There's things I'm sure you guys have heard of like Open Team, Regen Network, obviously  
**[0:16:11-0:16:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:16:11):**  Pasture Map.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:16:12):**  So it was interesting to see that Pasture Map got bought out by, I can't remember what  
**[0:16:18-0:16:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:16:18):**  that is.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:16:19):**  Soilworks.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:16:20):**  We're interviewing them in probably a month or so.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:16:22):**  Yeah.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:16:23):**  Okay.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:16:24):**  Yeah.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:16:25):**  So that was interesting to me because I'm not particularly interested in that kind of  
**[0:16:28-0:16:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:16:28):**  exit world, but it was interesting to me to see that that was the first time that a regenerative  
**[0:16:35-0:16:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:16:35):**  agriculture tech company had really taken that step.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:16:39):**  So that was, yeah.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:16:42):**  And I found it promising also because when I went and looked into Soilworks, it was really  
**[0:16:47-0:16:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:16:47):**  exciting to see what they were committed to.  
**[0:16:50-0:16:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:16:50):**  And it felt like they were the real deal.  
**[0:16:54-0:16:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:16:54):**  So that was cool.  
**[0:16:56-0:16:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:16:56):**  So yeah, that kind of thing is happening.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:16:58):**  And then I think, yeah, with Open Team and Regen Network, what I think is really interesting  
**[0:17:03-0:17:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:17:03):**  there is that Open Team also are quite, they have a good focus on farm, very practical  
**[0:17:13-0:17:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:17:13):**  observations as well.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:17:15):**  They work with LandPKS, I think, who similarly have this kind of observation, some of the  
**[0:17:23-0:17:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:17:23):**  observational focus as well.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:17:26):**  And that they're really trying to bring together many different teams and work together to,  
**[0:17:35-0:17:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:17:35):**  I guess, yeah, have technology really support regenerative agriculture rather than trying  
**[0:17:40-0:17:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:17:40):**  to build lots of different tech companies that are all competing for the space and not  
**[0:17:45-0:17:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:17:45):**  talking to each other.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:17:46):**  In a way, that seems counter to the ethos of regenerative agriculture in itself, that  
**[0:17:52-0:17:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:17:52):**  whole mindset of competing against each other to win the space.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:17:57):**  If you look at the regenerative farmers, they are all working together all the time.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:18:02):**  Even if they are in competition with each other to sell food, they're still working  
**[0:18:05-0:18:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:18:05):**  together.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:18:06):**  So I think that that's really exciting to see some of the regenerative principles very  
**[0:18:10-0:18:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:18:10):**  much reflected in the technology space.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:18:15):**  And also, they're trying to really sew up the whole thing so that you have the monitoring  
**[0:18:20-0:18:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:18:20):**  on the ground, which then feeds into the markets, which then potentially brings money back to  
**[0:18:27-0:18:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:18:27):**  the farm and also helps with carbon sequestration.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:18:32):**  So that seems like an exciting project.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:18:36):**  I was also excited to talk to the Regen Network people because I do have concerns around the  
**[0:18:43-0:18:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:18:43):**  abstraction of what a farm can offer.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:18:48):**  So I guess I'm most comfortable in the soil, basically, and seeing very physical things.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:18:58):**  So as soon as soil becomes a unit or a carbon equivalent unit and then is sold on a market  
**[0:19:08-0:19:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:19:08):**  somewhere, that to me, you're starting to abstract things.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:19:13):**  And so I do have concerns around where the markets could start to really abstract or  
**[0:19:21-0:19:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:19:21):**  you know, everyone knows they can have really adverse effects if you don't stick to as close  
**[0:19:28-0:19:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:19:28):**  as possible to what we're really trying to achieve.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:19:33):**  And so I think that Regen Network, it was great to talk to them and realize that they're  
**[0:19:37-0:19:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:19:37):**  very aware of that and they're really trying to build technologies that will allow for  
**[0:19:44-0:19:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:19:44):**  kind of more of the whole picture of ecosystem services to be kind of packaged up and abstracted.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:19:52):**  But I think, yeah, I guess I find it risky the idea that we would just do a carbon audit  
**[0:19:57-0:19:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:19:57):**  of a farm, abstract that and sell it.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:19:59):**  That'd be fine.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:20:00):**  Yeah.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:20:01):**  Yeah.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:20:02):**  That to me is really, really dangerous ground.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:20:05):**  And if anyone still believes that's true, then I really advise you to go start trying  
**[0:20:10-0:20:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:20:10):**  to farm and see the reality.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:20:13):**  Yeah.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:20:14):**  I think for a lot of people in the ag tech space, unfortunately, my question is always  
**[0:20:18-0:20:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:20:18):**  when is the last time you visited a farm or talk to a regenerative farmer or where's the  
**[0:20:23-0:20:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:20:23):**  farmer on your team slash board?  
**[0:20:25-0:20:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:20:25):**  And you'll be surprised by the answers or disappointed mainly.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:20:29):**  Like it's really for them talking to them and talking with instead of actually partnering  
**[0:20:35-0:20:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:20:35):**  or actually and it's, yeah, it's way more complicated and more interesting probably  
**[0:20:40-0:20:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:20:40):**  if you actually partner.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:20:42):**  So it's for two people that don't come from the farming space.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:20:44):**  I think we can we can agree on that.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:20:46):**  Yeah.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:20:47):**  And I think I have one thing to say about on the morning.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:20:51):**  Another concern, I guess, actually, is I think there's some really exciting stuff happening  
**[0:20:56-0:21:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:20:56):**  from a satellite perspective and, you know, using algorithms to automatically kind of  
**[0:21:04-0:21:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:21:04):**  categorize fields or soil types and that kind of stuff.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:21:07):**  So there's some really great tech companies out there doing that.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:21:13):**  But what I started to realize is that, you know, those algorithms are trained on categorizing  
**[0:21:19-0:21:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:21:19):**  essentially monocultures.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:21:23):**  And I don't know where they could go to learn.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:21:27):**  Or yeah, so I guess what I'm saying is that we're building technologies that, you know,  
**[0:21:32-0:21:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:21:32):**  they may be focused on soils, but they're focused on the soils that are the basis of  
**[0:21:37-0:21:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:21:37):**  monocultural systems.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:21:39):**  And actually, that's that's not that's not regenerative agriculture in my mind.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:21:45):**  It may be the start of it.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:21:46):**  But so I do have concerns that we're going to build categories.  
**[0:21:53-0:21:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:21:53):**  So I can give you an example.  
**[0:21:54-0:21:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:21:54):**  Like there's a company that they automatically now they reckon that they can automatically  
**[0:21:59-0:22:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:21:59):**  categorize almost any field from a satellite image.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:22:03):**  But the categories they give you are like corn, soy, basically all the commodities.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:22:10):**  But where's the space for like companion cropping or an agroforestry field?  
**[0:22:16-0:22:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:22:16):**  You know, like none of that's in there.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:22:17):**  And I so yeah, that's another tension.  
**[0:22:22-0:22:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:22:22):**  Can they deal with agroforestry?  
**[0:22:23-0:22:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:22:23):**  Yeah, I don't know.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:22:24):**  It's way more complex.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:22:25):**  It's what we can measure.  
**[0:22:28-0:22:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:22:28):**  I remember and a shout out to Francesco who's on the call.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:22:32):**  I interviewed Dr. Elaine Ingham last week and she was mentioning the soil food web and  
**[0:22:37-0:22:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:22:37):**  how we see what we measure.  
**[0:22:40-0:22:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:22:40):**  And she was explaining that for a lot of the soil scientists, they basically have the substrate  
**[0:22:45-0:22:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:22:45):**  where they grow, they take a piece of soil and they put it on the substrate.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:22:50):**  And the substrate is very limited food.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:22:51):**  So only two or three types of bacteria actually grow on that.  
**[0:22:54-0:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:22:54):**  And then you put it on a microscope and you see those bacteria.  
**[0:22:56-0:23:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:22:56):**  If you don't see the other 75,000 that are normally living in it.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:23:00):**  And that shows, I mean, if you're if you only have six categories of your satellite, I'm  
**[0:23:05-0:23:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:23:05):**  just naming a number, then obviously you're going to see only six and you're going to  
**[0:23:09-0:23:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:23:09):**  see a lot of unknowns.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:23:10):**  And it's going to be tricky.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:23:12):**  It's very good.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:23:13):**  I think the overview and helping with observations is very interesting, but outsourcing it completely  
**[0:23:17-0:23:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:23:17):**  to a satellite algorithm is going to be tricky and it's just not going to help.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:23:23):**  It's going to be, okay, you have cover crops, so you get paid or, oh, you didn't, but what  
**[0:23:27-0:23:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:23:27):**  type or mixes 15 types or two or one is going to be very, and people are going to figure  
**[0:23:33-0:23:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:23:33):**  out ways to trick it, obviously, which is, which is always the case if we wait long enough.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:23:38):**  So I just put two links in, I put Regenet Network.  
**[0:23:41-0:23:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:23:41):**  We interviewed Gregory completely at the beginning.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:23:44):**  I still need to do an update with them because they came an enormous way.  
**[0:23:48-0:23:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:23:48):**  And so a heroes, which is a company based out of the Netherlands, I'm actually advising  
**[0:23:52-0:23:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:23:52):**  and they will be, I will be interviewing them hopefully soon as well.  
**[0:23:55-0:23:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:23:55):**  So there will be more of these ecosystem marketplaces.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:23:59):**  Everybody hates the word ecosystem, but there will be more interviews coming hopefully in  
**[0:24:03-0:24:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:24:03):**  the near future to dig deeper here because we had Nori on the call, which was great.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:24:08):**  And there's more there to, to explore and to explore these tensions that you mentioned.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:24:13):**  Can we quantify nature and how do we sell it or not sell it?  
**[0:24:17-0:24:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:24:17):**  And what is the marketplace and all of those, we need to, we need to dig deeper.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:24:23):**  And with that, I think we're going to open it up because we said a Q and a, and we actually  
**[0:24:26-0:24:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:24:26):**  have a question already.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:24:27):**  Marcus send us a question who is on the call or I saw before.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:24:30):**  And so I'm going to type it in the chat so we don't forget it in the show notes, but  
**[0:24:33-0:24:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:24:33):**  you can actually ask it Marcus, if you're still there at life, if you want to, oh, you  
**[0:24:38-0:24:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:24:38):**  are there actually.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:24:39):**  Let you see Marcus link.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:24:42):**  Are you listening?  
**[0:24:43-0:24:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:24:43):**  Or it's just a picture.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:24:44):**  I don't know.  
**[0:24:45-0:24:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:24:45):**  I mean, you can read the, um, the question of Marcus of new foundation farms and just  
**[0:24:52-0:24:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:24:52):**  have a, have a stab at it.  
**[0:24:56-0:25:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:24:56):**  And for anybody else with questions, I saw your question, uh, Nisha, we'll get to that  
**[0:25:00-0:25:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:25:00):**  and then we'll basically open it up from there.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:25:03):**  And next time, if you're interested and you have questions beforehand, definitely send  
**[0:25:06-0:25:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:25:06):**  me, it should be a message when you have them.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:25:08):**  Yeah.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:25:09):**  So I can speak to Marcus's question.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:25:12):**  Um, so, um, I mentioned that we had worked with, um, NIAB, uh, to create this like soil  
**[0:25:21-0:25:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:25:21):**  quality dashboard.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:25:22):**  Um, and that was a little bit about comparing the other aspect to it that I didn't talk  
**[0:25:26-0:25:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:25:26):**  about was that it also allowed farmers to like kind of click on a result and, uh, their  
**[0:25:31-0:25:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:25:31):**  outcomes and then to see exactly trend lines as, as Marcus said, but also to see, um, it's,  
**[0:25:41-0:25:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:25:41):**  it's what we called it was considerations.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:25:43):**  And it was, um, questions that you might ask yourself at this point, if you've got, like,  
**[0:25:48-0:25:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:25:48):**  for example, you've got your earthworm number is two, um, and it's showing a red on your,  
**[0:25:53-0:25:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:25:53):**  uh, scientific benchmarks.  
**[0:25:55-0:25:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:25:55):**  You're showing you're the lower quartile against all your peers.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:25:59):**  Um, now what, what does that mean?  
**[0:26:04-0:26:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:26:04):**  Um, and so I think that is the point where I would say, I don't think technology can  
**[0:26:09-0:26:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:26:09):**  provide all the answers.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:26:11):**  I do think that you have to investigate the situation, um, at hand.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:26:18):**  Probably you need to talk to other people and bring in different knowledge.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:26:21):**  But what I do think you can do there is help people ask questions that prompt them to find  
**[0:26:27-0:26:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:26:27):**  information more quickly.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:26:28):**  So that's, that's our approach at the moment.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:26:31):**  So we're just built like, that's what we're working on with Nicole Masters, Integrity  
**[0:26:35-0:26:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:26:35):**  Soils is tailoring that to a regenerative journey as opposed to right now.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:26:40):**  Um, it's more based on like how NIAB would advise people at that point, um, which is  
**[0:26:46-0:26:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:26:46):**  slightly different than a regenerative approach.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:26:48):**  So for example, um, yeah, you know, he said, can it help me work out how I might stack  
**[0:26:54-0:26:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:26:54):**  enterprises for best effect?  
**[0:26:56-0:27:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:26:56):**  It could ask the kind of questions like, um, you know, have you thought about introducing  
**[0:27:02-0:27:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:27:02):**  pastured pigs into your system to improve, um, earthworm numbers and, you know, here's  
**[0:27:08-0:27:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:27:08):**  a case study of someone who has, so it's that kind of, that's the approach we're taking.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:27:14):**  And I would still look to have, uh, it be either through conversation with your co-learning  
**[0:27:22-0:27:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:27:22):**  group, um, and often those co-learning groups have like soils advisors they work with biodiversity  
**[0:27:28-0:27:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:27:28):**  advisors they work with.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:27:30):**  Um, but yeah, I think that's kind of the extent that we would go to.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:27:37):**  I wouldn't want to say you should do this because I don't think you can actually say  
**[0:27:42-0:27:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:27:42):**  that automatically.  
**[0:27:43-0:27:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:27:43):**  Yeah, at the end it's the choice and the interest and curiosity of farmers that listen to the  
**[0:27:54-0:27:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:27:54):**  most interesting pieces probably.  
**[0:27:56-0:27:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:27:56):**  Yeah.  
**[0:27:57-0:28:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:27:57):**  And it's a whole, it's like, it's a whole picture.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:28:00):**  You know, if you think about the whole, uh, holistic management framework, they start  
**[0:28:05-0:28:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:28:05):**  from what are the goals of the farmer.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:28:08):**  And that is a really important place to start from, um, to then think about how you're going  
**[0:28:14-0:28:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:28:14):**  to, uh, implement your regenerative practices.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:28:18):**  Because I mean, another huge benefit of regenerative agriculture that I've heard farmers talk about  
**[0:28:23-0:28:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:28:23):**  is that they literally enjoy their life more.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:28:27):**  And I mean, we can't underestimate those kinds of things as a big part of what regenerative  
**[0:28:31-0:28:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:28:31):**  agriculture is about.  
**[0:28:32-0:28:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:28:32):**  It's, you know, I started saying it's about diversity and health.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:28:36):**  And I think, you know, health on so many levels like soil health, family health, mental health,  
**[0:28:42-0:28:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:28:42):**  um, ecosystem health.  
**[0:28:44-0:28:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:28:44):**  It's just, yeah.  
**[0:28:46-0:28:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:28:46):**  So that's why I think, um, you can't be super prescriptive at that point.  
**[0:28:52-0:28:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:28:52):**  And there are many, many options of what someone could do.  
**[0:28:55-0:28:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:28:55):**  And it's sort of like, again, going back to the farmer is expert on their own farm.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:28:59):**  They've got to figure that out for that exact location on the planet earth and for their  
**[0:29:04-0:29:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:29:04):**  exact paradigm essentially.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:29:06):**  And we got a question from Mia.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:29:09):**  Oh, let me scroll up.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:29:11):**  What tests do you recommend for ranchers?  
**[0:29:13-0:29:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:29:13):**  It's a very broad question.  
**[0:29:15-0:29:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:29:15):**  Um, but is there, I mean, from the grazing people you work with, um, if you are actually,  
**[0:29:22-0:29:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:29:22):**  because I'm not, what are the tests they use the most?  
**[0:29:27-0:29:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:29:27):**  Actually, I think that's a, that's a sharper question.  
**[0:29:30-0:29:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:29:30):**  What do they, what do they benefit from the most?  
**[0:29:34-0:29:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:29:34):**  So I think actually if you're just starting, one of the very best things to look at, if  
**[0:29:38-0:29:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:29:38):**  you want to see the quickest return or the quickest changes is actually to what we call  
**[0:29:44-0:29:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:29:44):**  a rise of sheath test.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:29:46):**  And you can go on our website, soils.beetacycle.com and all of our tests are there like totally  
**[0:29:52-0:29:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:29:52):**  open and you can see how to do each one and how you would grade them.  
**[0:29:56-0:29:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:29:56):**  Um, yeah.  
**[0:29:58-0:30:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:29:58):**  So I think the rise of sheath test is actually the best place to start if you're starting  
**[0:30:02-0:30:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:30:02):**  out because that is just involves digging up, pulling out the plant and looking at the  
**[0:30:07-0:30:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:30:07):**  roots and seeing how much soil is stuck to the roots.  
**[0:30:12-0:30:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:30:12):**  Because if you see the root as the place where, um, root is the place where good soils are  
**[0:30:19-0:30:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:30:19):**  made essentially.  
**[0:30:22-0:30:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:30:22):**  And so you essentially are looking at a soil, healthy soil factory on the roots.  
**[0:30:28-0:30:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:30:28):**  And if your roots are white and they don't, they aren't like helping to produce this healthy  
**[0:30:32-0:30:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:30:32):**  soil, then that's a sign that essentially the biology or your plants aren't interacting  
**[0:30:38-0:30:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:30:38):**  with this soil web below.  
**[0:30:41-0:30:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:30:41):**  So what we've noticed with, especially with grazers is that within like that can start  
**[0:30:48-0:30:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:30:48):**  to change within six months.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:30:51):**  So that's a really nice one to start with.  
**[0:30:53-0:30:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:30:53):**  And I think the other one is the slate test, like for the wet aggregate stability test.  
**[0:30:59-0:31:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:30:59):**  It does depend a little bit on where you are in the world and what your soil is.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:31:03):**  Like if it's a super heavy clay soil, it can be harder to learn from, um, or you just need  
**[0:31:08-0:31:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:31:08):**  to leave it to dry more.  
**[0:31:10-0:31:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:31:10):**  But, um, the, yeah, the wet aggregate stability test is a brilliant way to start to understand  
**[0:31:17-0:31:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:31:17):**  again, how well does your soil hold together in water?  
**[0:31:22-0:31:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:31:22):**  And really you want it to hold together really, really well because it's been built biologically  
**[0:31:26-0:31:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:31:26):**  and therefore it's covered in slimes, which mean that the water can't break down the soil  
**[0:31:32-0:31:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:31:32):**  structure essentially, which I have to say, when I first learned about soils, that was  
**[0:31:37-0:31:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:31:37):**  counterintuitive to me.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:31:38):**  Cause I would think you don't want something that doesn't break down in water, but actually  
**[0:31:43-0:31:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:31:43):**  you do because that then it retains structure like in a flood or for example, it retains  
**[0:31:48-0:31:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:31:48):**  its structure and it allows for oxygen and water to kind of move through it and around  
**[0:31:52-0:31:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:31:52):**  it and be stored.  
**[0:31:54-0:31:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:31:54):**  But it keeps air and water kind of throughout the soil profile basically.  
**[0:31:58-0:32:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:31:58):**  So those are my two faves.  
**[0:32:00-0:32:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:32:00):**  I guess the other one is like a visual evaluation as well.  
**[0:32:02-0:32:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:32:02):**  So digging a hole and then there's kind of a framework for scoring that.  
**[0:32:06-0:32:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:32:06):**  And that is also, if you can get your eye in for that, just go dig.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:32:09):**  Well, in the UK we say go dig under a hedge, but essentially we're saying like an untouched  
**[0:32:15-0:32:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:32:15):**  area nearby and then go dig.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:32:17):**  Yeah, dig in the middle of the field.  
**[0:32:21-0:32:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:32:21):**  So you can assume your soil types are relatively similar and just look at the difference in  
**[0:32:24-0:32:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:32:24):**  those soils visually.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:32:27):**  And that starts to give you a really good idea of what the potential of your field is.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:32:32):**  In terms of biodiversity.  
**[0:32:33-0:32:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:32:33):**  I saw a question of Jeffrey, which Marcus answered.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:32:36):**  Thank you for that.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:32:39):**  The neck or the regenerative agriculture certification.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:32:43):**  There's a lot of different works happening there, but mainly it's rodeo together with  
**[0:32:46-0:32:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:32:46):**  Patagonia and Dr. Bronner's who are launching or have launched actually regenerative organic  
**[0:32:51-0:32:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:32:51):**  certification, basically an add on or the next level of organic.  
**[0:32:56-0:32:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:32:56):**  And the jury is still out of that's going to be the solution.  
**[0:32:59-0:33:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:32:59):**  And but there's a lot of effort being put there.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:33:01):**  And I just put the link in the description.  
**[0:33:03-0:33:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:33:03):**  There's actually a lot of work being done this year and they don't have many farms.  
**[0:33:07-0:33:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:33:07):**  Actually I don't think they have one in Europe.  
**[0:33:11-0:33:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:33:11):**  So they work with a lot of different test farms.  
**[0:33:13-0:33:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:33:13):**  They work with vineyards, coconut producers in basically a lot of different geographies,  
**[0:33:19-0:33:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:33:19):**  but Europe is still underrepresented there.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:33:21):**  So for some people may be interesting to get in touch or to engage.  
**[0:33:25-0:33:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:33:25):**  I see a question from Ethan Steinberg.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:33:27):**  Hi Ethan.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:33:28):**  Congratulations with the race and propagates raised one and a half million.  
**[0:33:32-0:33:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:33:32):**  What traction have you had with farmers using the software and what are the barriers to  
**[0:33:36-0:33:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:33:36):**  keep them from being comfortable with utilizing your tool?  
**[0:33:41-0:33:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:33:41):**  Yeah, so I would say one of the key barriers is actually it is a paradigm shift to think  
**[0:33:50-0:33:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:33:50):**  that the farmer is the expert.  
**[0:33:53-0:33:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:33:53):**  Like so even today, we find that most people are using our app.  
**[0:33:57-0:34:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:33:57):**  They use it with a soils advisor of some sort or and the soils advisor will come in and  
**[0:34:04-0:34:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:34:04):**  do the tests and the farmer will kind of accompany them.  
**[0:34:09-0:34:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:34:09):**  So it's only the most like pioneering, confident farmers who will actually go do the test themselves  
**[0:34:17-0:34:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:34:17):**  and feel confident in that.  
**[0:34:20-0:34:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:34:20):**  So that I would say that is in a way the biggest barrier we found in using the software.  
**[0:34:30-0:34:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:34:30):**  I think the other, yeah, in terms of being comfortable with utilizing the tool, that's  
**[0:34:42-0:34:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:34:42):**  why we're really starting to focus on the farming groups because we found that I can't  
**[0:34:52-0:34:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:34:52):**  speak for the United States so well actually in this or but certainly in the UK.  
**[0:34:58-0:35:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:34:58):**  There are a lot of different farming groups and the farm cluster has actually become a  
**[0:35:02-0:35:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:35:02):**  really prominent feature in the farming world today and very effective way of bringing together  
**[0:35:08-0:35:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:35:08):**  many different farmers who farm in different ways, but they're all kind of local to each  
**[0:35:12-0:35:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:35:12):**  other.  
**[0:35:13-0:35:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:35:13):**  They're kind of in the same watershed, you might say, and they're all working together  
**[0:35:17-0:35:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:35:17):**  to transform that landscape for better biodiversity and soil health.  
**[0:35:21-0:35:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:35:21):**  And so we're really looking to work with those groups because they are already, you know,  
**[0:35:26-0:35:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:35:26):**  they're always sharing pictures about the biodiversity they see and they're excited  
**[0:35:30-0:35:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:35:30):**  together.  
**[0:35:31-0:35:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:35:31):**  So that's kind of the approach we're taking to try and engage directly with farmers.  
**[0:35:39-0:35:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:35:39):**  So we'll see.  
**[0:35:40-0:35:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:35:40):**  That isn't proven and that's where we're going.  
**[0:35:43-0:35:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:35:43):**  And in terms of the, what do you think the second part of the question of Ethan of making  
**[0:35:48-0:35:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:35:48):**  more complex systems like our first three, which I touched upon that very, very briefly.  
**[0:35:53-0:35:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:35:53):**  What is the role of technology there to make that more accessible?  
**[0:35:57-0:35:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:35:57):**  Because that's a huge step.  
**[0:35:58-0:36:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:35:58):**  The moment you add trees or any complex animal to your system, you basically add a layer  
**[0:36:05-0:36:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:36:05):**  of complexity.  
**[0:36:06-0:36:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:36:06):**  And what have you seen there?  
**[0:36:09-0:36:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:36:09):**  Yeah, I think, well, I guess I would ask Ethan back in terms of, is it, do you think it's  
**[0:36:20-0:36:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:36:20):**  that the farmers aren't understanding agroforestry and like how to manage their trees, for example,  
**[0:36:26-0:36:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:36:26):**  like where does the complexity lie?  
**[0:36:27-0:36:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:36:27):**  Is it the idea of introducing trees into the system?  
**[0:36:30-0:36:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:36:30):**  Is it that they don't know how to care for trees?  
**[0:36:34-0:36:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:36:34):**  Because I guess we do work with a few people in agroforestry and it seems to be a relatively  
**[0:36:46-0:36:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:36:46):**  natural evolution.  
**[0:36:48-0:36:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:36:48):**  I have to say here in the UK, there is a lot of government help for that kind of stuff  
**[0:36:52-0:36:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:36:52):**  as well.  
**[0:36:53-0:37:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:36:53):**  So it's maybe not as big a jump to start in that sense because you don't have to put out  
**[0:37:00-0:37:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:37:00):**  as much money, but it seems to be a relatively natural evolution.  
**[0:37:05-0:37:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:37:05):**  Once you start to see what helps build soil health and you start even with a cover crop  
**[0:37:10-0:37:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:37:10):**  and that diversity and you start to see these rhizosheets forming and you're in conversation  
**[0:37:16-0:37:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:37:16):**  with your soils advisor, it sort of all seems to follow.  
**[0:37:22-0:37:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:37:22):**  It's like once you get going, the boulder kind of just keeps rolling, rolling, rolling  
**[0:37:27-0:37:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:37:27):**  and gets faster and heavier.  
**[0:37:28-0:37:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:37:28):**  All right, not heavier, but obviously, but it's just, it's going.  
**[0:37:32-0:37:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:37:32):**  So my experience is I wouldn't start someone on agroforestry because I think that just  
**[0:37:37-0:37:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:37:37):**  placing trees in a field is actually quite difficult.  
**[0:37:43-0:37:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:37:43):**  It's a really difficult place to start.  
**[0:37:44-0:37:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:37:44):**  Trees do die a lot.  
**[0:37:47-0:37:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:37:47):**  And if you don't understand what's going on below ground and how you could foster that  
**[0:37:51-0:37:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:37:51):**  soil with and the biodiversity and all the beneficial insects, then you're probably not  
**[0:37:57-0:37:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:37:57):**  going to have much success.  
**[0:37:59-0:38:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:37:59):**  So yeah, that would be my answer to that.  
**[0:38:04-0:38:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:38:04):**  It's like starting with things that you can really see in a shorter time period, I guess,  
**[0:38:09-0:38:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:38:09):**  and start to like embrace that complexity in those situations.  
**[0:38:15-0:38:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:38:15):**  And then you can start to work with agroforestry systems that you don't have to understand  
**[0:38:20-0:38:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:38:20):**  every single interaction that's going on, but you can understand the basics of the complex  
**[0:38:25-0:38:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:38:25):**  web that's happening around it in a sense.  
**[0:38:29-0:38:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:38:29):**  I have to say, I want to add one thing here, which is that so our company, we say we're  
**[0:38:33-0:38:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:38:33):**  committed to ecology, profitability and beauty.  
**[0:38:37-0:38:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:38:37):**  And a lot of people really cringe at beauty because how do you measure it?  
**[0:38:42-0:38:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:38:42):**  But what I have found is that a lot of farmers really identify with the word beauty.  
**[0:38:48-0:38:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:38:48):**  Even the gruffest farmers can understand what beauty means to them.  
**[0:38:53-0:39:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:38:53):**  And that's part of why a lot of people go into farming is because they get that feeling  
**[0:39:01-0:39:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:39:01):**  of being on the farm.  
**[0:39:02-0:39:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:39:02):**  And that is part of what regenerative agriculture is.  
**[0:39:04-0:39:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:39:04):**  That great feeling of things, and I've had a few conversations with some regenerative  
**[0:39:09-0:39:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:39:09):**  farmers here in the UK about that using beauty as your guide through complex systems.  
**[0:39:18-0:39:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:39:18):**  And I know that sounds super esoteric, but it was interesting.  
**[0:39:23-0:39:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:39:23):**  I mean, these farmers aren't particularly like spiritual or anything like that, but  
**[0:39:28-0:39:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:39:28):**  they really got that.  
**[0:39:29-0:39:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:39:29):**  They were like, yeah, it's like, you know, when it's right and you can start to feel  
**[0:39:35-0:39:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:39:35):**  it.  
**[0:39:37-0:39:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:39:37):**  And so I think, yeah, developing that feeling is.  
**[0:39:41-0:39:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:39:41):**  Trees help with that.  
**[0:39:42-0:39:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:39:42):**  Part of it.  
**[0:39:43-0:39:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:39:43):**  I think that's the trees absolutely help.  
**[0:39:46-0:39:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:39:46):**  Francisco has a question.  
**[0:39:47-0:39:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:39:47):**  Abby, are you considering adding a feature for soil microbiology to SoilMentor, for example,  
**[0:39:52-0:39:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:39:52):**  monitoring the evolution of fungi, bacteria ratios and the co-related with other good  
**[0:39:57-0:39:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:39:57):**  regenerative practices?  
**[0:39:59-0:40:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:39:59):**  Yeah, I mean, absolutely.  
**[0:40:01-0:40:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:40:01):**  I think that's definitely the direction we're going in.  
**[0:40:03-0:40:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:40:03):**  It's how can we have these very visual practical tests you can do in the field alongside like  
**[0:40:12-0:40:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:40:12):**  fungal to bacteria ratios, which my understanding is those are more elaning and based kind of  
**[0:40:18-0:40:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:40:18):**  protocols.  
**[0:40:19-0:40:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:40:19):**  So you look down a microscope and you can learn to do that yourself, but it's slightly  
**[0:40:25-0:40:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:40:25):**  more difficult and requires a bit more equipment.  
**[0:40:27-0:40:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:40:27):**  I think often people will ask other people to do it for them.  
**[0:40:32-0:40:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:40:32):**  But absolutely, those are the kinds of measurements that sit alongside your slate test and your  
**[0:40:39-0:40:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:40:39):**  riser sheets.  
**[0:40:41-0:40:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:40:41):**  And it's all part of understanding how everything's evolving.  
**[0:40:47-0:40:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:40:47):**  So yeah, I think absolutely.  
**[0:40:49-0:40:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:40:49):**  And I think, again, like working with Nicole Masters, those are the kinds of questions  
**[0:40:53-0:40:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:40:53):**  we're going to be asking is what lab tests should we have alongside the earthworm count  
**[0:40:58-0:41:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:40:58):**  and the vest test to really allow for the full picture.  
**[0:41:05-0:41:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:41:05):**  And Nisha had a question.  
**[0:41:06-0:41:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:41:06):**  What do you think about the soil micro biometer?  
**[0:41:08-0:41:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:41:08):**  I don't know what that is.  
**[0:41:11-0:41:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:41:11):**  Can you put a link in the description below, Nisha?  
**[0:41:16-0:41:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:41:16):**  Maybe I've come across it before.  
**[0:41:17-0:41:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:41:17):**  I think it was an automatic.  
**[0:41:20-0:41:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:41:20):**  I'm imagining it's maybe the...  
**[0:41:22-0:41:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:41:22):**  Like the microbiology, the microbial life.  
**[0:41:26-0:41:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:41:26):**  Maybe it's then Kittredge's meter.  
**[0:41:29-0:41:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:41:29):**  But that's by a nutrient, which is more about like once you've got the vegetable itself.  
**[0:41:33-0:41:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:41:33):**  I know, but there was soil in that.  
**[0:41:35-0:41:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:41:35):**  I remember they do, but it's mostly soil organic matter, I think for now.  
**[0:41:41-0:41:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:41:41):**  Anyway, we'll see it in the chat.  
**[0:41:44-0:41:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:41:44):**  Matt Smith asking, how do you think about balancing fast, broad data collection against  
**[0:41:48-0:41:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:41:48):**  slower and more detailed data collection?  
**[0:41:50-0:41:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:41:50):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:41:51-0:41:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:41:51):**  We can spend an hour on that probably.  
**[0:41:56-0:42:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:41:56):**  I think that's really...  
**[0:42:00-0:42:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:42:00):**  I think that is an important part of how we're going to move forward.  
**[0:42:03-0:42:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:42:03):**  I was being a little bit critical of some of the satellite imagery work and how that  
**[0:42:08-0:42:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:42:08):**  can't really deal with the complexity on the ground.  
**[0:42:11-0:42:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:42:11):**  But I do think it's also super helpful for just...  
**[0:42:16-0:42:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:42:16):**  If from the earth, you can just track the percentage of bare soil, for example.  
**[0:42:20-0:42:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:42:20):**  Bare soil is a problem in many situations.  
**[0:42:24-0:42:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:42:24):**  It's not always the problem.  
**[0:42:26-0:42:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:42:26):**  So I think, again, you could do a tracking of bare soil percentage across fields.  
**[0:42:31-0:42:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:42:31):**  And then you would have to ground truth where there are huge amounts of bare soil.  
**[0:42:36-0:42:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:42:36):**  Maybe that's a farmer who has plowed their field for the first time in 10 years because  
**[0:42:40-0:42:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:42:40):**  they needed to do some intervention.  
**[0:42:43-0:42:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:42:43):**  And that's part of a regenerative agriculture regime or practice.  
**[0:42:46-0:42:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:42:46):**  So yeah, I guess it's about finding a way to have the two kind of dance together.  
**[0:42:59-0:43:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:42:59):**  And I haven't...  
**[0:43:00-0:43:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:43:00):**  I guess in a way that's what I think that Open Team are trying to do to a certain extent.  
**[0:43:06-0:43:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:43:06):**  I don't know.  
**[0:43:07-0:43:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:43:07):**  I haven't...  
**[0:43:08-0:43:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:43:08):**  But I think that that's a really good question to ask in terms of for myself as well.  
**[0:43:13-0:43:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:43:13):**  Who are we collaborating with?  
**[0:43:15-0:43:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:43:15):**  Who's doing some of that more fast broad data collection that we can then allow for some  
**[0:43:20-0:43:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:43:20):**  of the slow data collection to be brought together?  
**[0:43:25-0:43:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:43:25):**  That would be a smart collaboration for us, I would say.  
**[0:43:32-0:43:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:43:32):**  Let's keep moving because we're getting close to the hour.  
**[0:43:35-0:43:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:43:35):**  What's the name of the farmer group that's working together?  
**[0:43:37-0:43:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:43:37):**  I think there are farmer groups throughout the UK if I heard you right, like the farmers.  
**[0:43:41-0:43:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:43:41):**  Yeah, that's right.  
**[0:43:42-0:43:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:43:42):**  So they're called Farm Clusters.  
**[0:43:45-0:43:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:43:45):**  That's what they call them here.  
**[0:43:49-0:43:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:43:49):**  And basically they're organized throughout the country.  
**[0:43:51-0:43:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:43:51):**  Okay.  
**[0:43:52-0:43:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:43:52):**  Yeah, I can try and find a link for that.  
**[0:43:54-0:43:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:43:54):**  Then we can put it into show notes after.  
**[0:43:57-0:43:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:43:57):**  Then Margaret had a question.  
**[0:43:59-0:44:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:43:59):**  You want to unmute yourself?  
**[0:44:00-0:44:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:44:00):**  I can unmute myself.  
**[0:44:01-0:44:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:44:01):**  I think you can talk.  
**[0:44:02-0:44:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:44:02):**  You can talk.  
**[0:44:03-0:44:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:44:03):**  Thanks for being here.  
**[0:44:04-0:44:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:44:04):**  It's great to meet you, Abby.  
**[0:44:05-0:44:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:44:05):**  I find these seminars very helpful and interesting.  
**[0:44:14-0:44:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:44:14):**  So my question was just much more broad.  
**[0:44:18-0:44:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:44:18):**  You sitting at the intersection of technology and agriculture, I'm not in the field, background  
**[0:44:24-0:44:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:44:24):**  and business.  
**[0:44:25-0:44:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:44:25):**  So if you could just kind of up level, what keeps you up at night?  
**[0:44:28-0:44:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:44:28):**  I'm kind of thinking about if there's like one issue that just really top of mind, hard  
**[0:44:34-0:44:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:44:34):**  to limit, I'm sure, because you have a lot.  
**[0:44:37-0:44:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:44:37):**  But at a really high level, yeah, what is that one or two things that really keep you  
**[0:44:43-0:44:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:44:43):**  up at night?  
**[0:44:44-0:44:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:44:44):**  Yeah, I guess I really do care about soil is the truth there.  
**[0:44:51-0:45:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:44:51):**  And I think soil health, it can't be like, we can't underestimate how valuable soil health  
**[0:45:00-0:45:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:45:00):**  is to all of us every day in so many ways.  
**[0:45:06-0:45:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:45:06):**  I think that so building soil health across the globe does feel like a really positive  
**[0:45:16-0:45:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:45:16):**  aim.  
**[0:45:20-0:45:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:45:20):**  But I guess I would also say that I do think that what keeps me up at night is the worry  
**[0:45:25-0:45:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:45:25):**  that we're too black and white about things, that we're too, this is the answer.  
**[0:45:30-0:45:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:45:30):**  No, this is the answer and that kind of the dichotomy, the thinking in dichotomies, or  
**[0:45:36-0:45:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:45:36):**  that something's right and something's wrong.  
**[0:45:38-0:45:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:45:38):**  And I think that actually, truthfully, maybe that keeps me up more than anything.  
**[0:45:42-0:45:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:45:42):**  And that's why I'm really pro these very physical visual tasks is because you have to be there,  
**[0:45:47-0:45:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:45:47):**  you have to look, and you have to make an assessment as a human being on the spot rather  
**[0:45:52-0:46:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:45:52):**  than something that's pre-programmed, predetermined, and embedded with all sorts of issues that  
**[0:46:03-0:46:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:46:03):**  someone decided this was right and this was wrong.  
**[0:46:06-0:46:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:46:06):**  But actually, in your situation, it might be completely the opposite.  
**[0:46:10-0:46:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:46:10):**  And that's, I think, what I've, that was my main learning from farming, and from visiting  
**[0:46:14-0:46:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:46:14):**  many different farms is that there is no right way, basically, like you cannot say this is  
**[0:46:21-0:46:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:46:21):**  the way to do it.  
**[0:46:23-0:46:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:46:23):**  So we really have to build systems that iterate, respond, and work with individuals or localised  
**[0:46:33-0:46:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:46:33):**  scenarios in my view.  
**[0:46:37-0:46:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:46:37):**  And Martin had a question or has a question about what about regenerative farmers that  
**[0:46:41-0:46:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:46:41):**  are not certified organic?  
**[0:46:43-0:46:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:46:43):**  They are still part of the regenerative movement, right?  
**[0:46:46-0:46:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:46:46):**  I can take a step of it, but you please go first.  
**[0:46:49-0:46:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:46:49):**  100%.  
**[0:46:50-0:46:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:46:50):**  Like I, so however idealistic some of my speaking may sound, I absolutely, I work with all types  
**[0:46:57-0:47:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:46:57):**  of farmers, and I definitely think that whatever farmers doing that that's absolutely okay.  
**[0:47:07-0:47:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:47:07):**  And that, you know, if they're still, if all they're doing is starting to look at their  
**[0:47:10-0:47:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:47:10):**  soil health, then that's brilliant.  
**[0:47:12-0:47:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:47:12):**  And I would say they've started their regenerative journey.  
**[0:47:15-0:47:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:47:15):**  And who knows how long that will take.  
**[0:47:19-0:47:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:47:19):**  And that, yeah, I guess that's another thing to say is that I really think it's important  
**[0:47:23-0:47:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:47:23):**  not to judge farmers for whatever they are doing or not doing.  
**[0:47:28-0:47:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:47:28):**  That I would say that farmers decisions are based on the system they're part of.  
**[0:47:34-0:47:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:47:34):**  And very infrequently does a farmer make a decision like, oh, I really want to go out  
**[0:47:37-0:47:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:47:37):**  and kill loads of bugs today because it's fun.  
**[0:47:41-0:47:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:47:41):**  They're doing that because it's a business and they need to make money and feed their  
**[0:47:45-0:47:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:47:45):**  family and this is the system we've all created for them to do that in.  
**[0:47:49-0:47:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:47:49):**  So I think it is really important.  
**[0:47:50-0:47:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:47:50):**  And I almost think this is part of our regenerative agriculture paradigm is to, it's not about  
**[0:47:55-0:47:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:47:55):**  dogma and it's not about judgment.  
**[0:47:57-0:48:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:47:57):**  It's about letting people start the journey wherever they are at and then gradually kind  
**[0:48:07-0:48:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:48:07):**  of start that rolling and learn things as they go.  
**[0:48:13-0:48:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:48:13):**  So yeah, it is, I'm open to it all, I guess.  
**[0:48:18-0:48:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:48:18):**  And I actually think like there's some organic farmers, certified organic farmers who are  
**[0:48:23-0:48:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:48:23):**  less regenerative than non-certified organic farmers.  
**[0:48:26-0:48:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:48:26):**  They're quite a few.  
**[0:48:29-0:48:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:48:29):**  From an environmental point of view, you can ask a lot of questions with a number of the  
**[0:48:33-0:48:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:48:33):**  organic farmers and a lot of questions with a number of the conventional farmers.  
**[0:48:37-0:48:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:48:37):**  It's not so black and white.  
**[0:48:39-0:48:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:48:39):**  Let's keep going so we can actually try to answer all the questions, but you keep typing,  
**[0:48:42-0:48:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:48:42):**  which is great.  
**[0:48:43-0:48:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:48:43):**  Thank you all for that.  
**[0:48:44-0:48:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:48:44):**  Nisha is asking, actually she put the microbiometer in a link below and we can follow up on that  
**[0:48:49-0:48:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:48:49):**  after.  
**[0:48:50-0:48:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:48:50):**  What's your biggest challenge?  
**[0:48:51-0:48:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:48:51):**  My biggest challenge?  
**[0:48:52-0:48:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:48:52):**  I love these massive questions.  
**[0:48:58-0:49:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:48:58):**  To the end of the call, which is really good.  
**[0:49:00-0:49:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:49:00):**  We started with very practical ones.  
**[0:49:02-0:49:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:49:02):**  What would you suggest to a rancher?  
**[0:49:04-0:49:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:49:04):**  Yeah.  
**[0:49:05-0:49:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:49:05):**  That's the biggest challenge.  
**[0:49:07-0:49:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:49:07):**  Top of your head.  
**[0:49:09-0:49:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:49:09):**  I do think that one of the biggest challenges is the mindset shift that's required.  
**[0:49:23-0:49:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:49:23):**  I've been working with a regenerative farmer called Fred Price here in the UK.  
**[0:49:28-0:49:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:49:28):**  We've been doing phone calls with many different farmers who are at different parts in their  
**[0:49:31-0:49:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:49:31):**  journey to really understand what are the barriers to change.  
**[0:49:36-0:49:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:49:36):**  I definitely... I'm losing my thread here.  
**[0:49:44-0:49:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:49:44):**  What comes up time and time again is there's so many different things that are locking  
**[0:49:49-0:49:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:49:49):**  them in, the other mindset and the other way or the chemical mindset.  
**[0:49:55-0:50:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:49:55):**  I think the biggest barrier to change is to allow people to gracefully move into the new  
**[0:50:05-0:50:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:50:05):**  paradigm.  
**[0:50:08-0:50:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:50:08):**  That's the challenge is how can we do that gracefully without some massive knockdown  
**[0:50:14-0:50:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:50:14):**  of everything that farmers have done for the last 60 years or 50 years?  
**[0:50:20-0:50:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:50:20):**  Because that's the age bracket most farmers are in.  
**[0:50:26-0:50:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:50:26):**  We need to work with that and not say everything you've done your whole life is terrible, but  
**[0:50:33-0:50:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:50:33):**  instead say, wow, this is a great opportunity to move forward.  
**[0:50:37-0:50:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:50:37):**  How can we support you in that and what are your barriers?  
**[0:50:40-0:50:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:50:40):**  Yes, I do think it's a huge challenge to allow a graceful transition, basically.  
**[0:50:47-0:50:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:50:47):**  I see a number of comments actually on the beauty part, which is great.  
**[0:50:53-0:50:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:50:53):**  Thank you, Matthew, for putting farmer clusters in the chat.  
**[0:50:57-0:51:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:50:57):**  I think we're up to our last question of Glenn.  
**[0:51:00-0:51:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:51:00):**  Are you working with any livestock farmers towards managing their grazing planning?  
**[0:51:04-0:51:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:51:04):**  Can you see a way of linking this to the biological monitoring of their paddocks?  
**[0:51:08-0:51:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:51:08):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:51:10-0:51:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:51:10):**  We do work with a number of farmers who are actually starting to graze where they haven't  
**[0:51:15-0:51:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:51:15):**  before.  
**[0:51:16-0:51:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:51:16):**  It is somewhat early days, I guess.  
**[0:51:22-0:51:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:51:22):**  We haven't created any visuals that really make those links yet.  
**[0:51:28-0:51:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:51:28):**  I think even in the level of grazing outcomes in terms of just how quickly does your grass  
**[0:51:35-0:51:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:51:35):**  grow back, what is your total grass crop from the field, those kinds of things can change  
**[0:51:42-0:51:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:51:42):**  quickly if you're starting to graze in a more holistic grazing way.  
**[0:51:47-0:51:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:51:47):**  Then you could start to link that allowing grass to grow longer and taller, that provides  
**[0:51:54-0:51:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:51:54):**  different habitats for different butterflies.  
**[0:51:57-0:52:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:51:57):**  We are collecting the data in the same location and in the same app, but we haven't actually  
**[0:52:03-0:52:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:52:03):**  created the visuals that bring the two together yet.  
**[0:52:06-0:52:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:52:06):**  But absolutely, that's something we're looking to do.  
**[0:52:11-0:52:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:52:11):**  I think PastureMapped do a bit of that already.  
**[0:52:13-0:52:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:52:13):**  I think they already have some ecosystem monitoring in their app as well, along with all of their  
**[0:52:21-0:52:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:52:21):**  grazing plans.  
**[0:52:22-0:52:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:52:22):**  Yeah, they're completely revised.  
**[0:52:24-0:52:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:52:24):**  I just talked to the new CEO and as they were brought by Soilworks and as the team wanted  
**[0:52:30-0:52:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:52:30):**  to move on to something else, Soilworks who started by actually two investors, one of  
**[0:52:35-0:52:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:52:35):**  them owns a big ranch and was using PastureMapped and didn't want it to die basically and set  
**[0:52:39-0:52:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:52:39):**  up a specific entity to start doing more of these.  
**[0:52:44-0:52:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:52:44):**  They're going to completely revamp PastureMapped and move on to that.  
**[0:52:47-0:52:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:52:47):**  I hope to have them on the show soon because you have so many paddocks and you need to  
**[0:52:53-0:52:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:52:53):**  follow that in some way or form and obviously also looking underneath.  
**[0:52:56-0:53:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:52:56):**  But most of the current grazing planning is literally paper and maybe some Excel and that's  
**[0:53:02-0:53:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:53:02):**  pretty much it, which there must be enormous inefficiencies or time spent there.  
**[0:53:08-0:53:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:53:08):**  Just to see, I saw a few more questions popping in.  
**[0:53:10-0:53:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:53:10):**  We have a few minutes.  
**[0:53:11-0:53:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:53:11):**  I see Jeffrey asking a question about the profitability.  
**[0:53:14-0:53:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:53:14):**  I just put an interview down below Jeffrey with Jonathan Lundgren, who's one of the few  
**[0:53:19-0:53:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:53:19):**  people, farmer and academia actually wrote a paper on the profitability of regenerative  
**[0:53:23-0:53:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:53:23):**  agriculture and showing that at least in their grain studies and they're doing the same with  
**[0:53:28-0:53:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:53:28):**  almonds and ranching actually now in the US that it greatly outperforms any extractive  
**[0:53:34-0:53:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:53:34):**  side of agriculture.  
**[0:53:35-0:53:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:53:35):**  I think it's an interesting myth.  
**[0:53:37-0:53:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:53:37):**  There are two myths there.  
**[0:53:38-0:53:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:53:38):**  One is that conventional extractive agriculture is very profitable, which I would argue it's  
**[0:53:43-0:53:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:53:43):**  not and two is that regenerative agriculture cannot be profitable, which I would argue  
**[0:53:48-0:53:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:53:48):**  it can definitely be.  
**[0:53:50-0:53:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:53:50):**  It happens on, it really depends on the system, the context, the farmer, the history, the  
**[0:53:54-0:53:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:53:54):**  farmers, the choices they make obviously as well.  
**[0:53:57-0:54:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:53:57):**  But I've seen very interesting examples of people having a very healthy life, let's say  
**[0:54:01-0:54:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:54:01):**  and also if they're farming, farming business.  
**[0:54:04-0:54:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:54:04):**  So I hope that answers your question and then just scrolling down, let's see if Francisco  
**[0:54:08-0:54:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:54:08):**  had a question.  
**[0:54:13-0:54:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:54:13):**  Quickly trying to read because we're getting on top of the hour.  
**[0:54:15-0:54:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:54:15):**  Otherwise I will try to add that into the show notes.  
**[0:54:20-0:54:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:54:20):**  I think that would be it if Francesca doesn't have a, it's a very specific field question.  
**[0:54:26-0:54:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:54:26):**  I will try to get into that in the show notes.  
**[0:54:28-0:54:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:54:28):**  I want to thank first of all, Abby for joining us today, spending a bit of time and sharing  
**[0:54:34-0:54:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:54:34):**  your story, your updates and your insights and answering questions.  
**[0:54:37-0:54:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:54:37):**  And then obviously thanking all of you for calling in on, what is it?  
**[0:54:42-0:54:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:54:42):**  The second of July today and I hope you have a great evening, a great day depending on  
**[0:54:47-0:54:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:54:47):**  where you are and hope to see you on the next one.  
**[0:54:50-0:54:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:54:50):**  Thanks so much.  
**[0:54:53-0:54:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:54:53):**  Dear friends of the podcast.  
**[0:54:58-0:55:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:54:58):**  I'm super excited to share with you the online video course, investing in regenerative agriculture  
**[0:55:03-0:55:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:55:03):**  and food, how to put money to work in regenerating soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty  
**[0:55:08-0:55:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:55:08):**  food while doing it.  
**[0:55:09-0:55:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:55:09):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[0:55:11-0:55:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:55:11):**  After a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of audio asking the question,  
**[0:55:15-0:55:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:55:15):**  how to put money to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011  
**[0:55:20-0:55:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:55:20):**  and recording these podcasts since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  
**[0:55:25-0:55:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:55:25):**  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  
**[0:55:27-0:55:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:55:27):**  How have we built our decision-making framework?  
**[0:55:30-0:55:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:55:30):**  What to focus on with the podcast?  
**[0:55:32-0:55:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:55:32):**  How have we picked interviewees?  
**[0:55:35-0:55:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:55:35):**  And what questions should you ask?  
**[0:55:36-0:55:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:55:36):**  What is happening in the space?

**[0:55:38-0:55:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:55:38):**  What should you listen?  
**[0:55:40-0:55:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:55:40):**  What should you watch?  
**[0:55:41-0:55:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:55:41):**  How to approach this space?  
**[0:55:44-0:55:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:55:44):**  For whom is this course?

**[0:56:41-0:56:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:56:41):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  
**[0:56:48-0:56:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:56:48):**  so you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:56:50-0:56:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:56:50):**  We're gonna look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:56:55-0:57:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:56:55):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:57:00-0:57:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:57:00):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[0:57:05-0:57:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:57:05):**  if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:57:07-0:57:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:57:07):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:57:11-0:57:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:57:11):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:57:15-0:57:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:57:15):**  We're gonna look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:57:20-0:57:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:57:20):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:57:21-0:57:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:57:21):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:57:23-0:57:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:57:23):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:57:26-0:57:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:57:26):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:57:29-0:57:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:57:29):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:57:31-0:57:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:57:31):**  Before making any investment please find professional investment advice.  
**[0:57:36-0:57:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-abby-rose#t=0:57:36):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking.

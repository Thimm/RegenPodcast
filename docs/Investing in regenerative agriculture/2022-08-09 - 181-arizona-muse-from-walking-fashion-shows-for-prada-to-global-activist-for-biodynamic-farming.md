**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:00:14):**  Learn how a journey which started in the environmental bubble of Arizona in the US led to a high  
**[0:00:19-0:00:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:00:19):**  end fashion career with shows for Gucci, Prada, front covers of Vogue and much more.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:00:25):**  Where our guest of today was exposed to the incredible destruction of the fashion industry,  
**[0:00:29-0:00:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:00:29):**  which awoke an activist in her.  
**[0:00:31-0:00:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:00:31):**  She dove deep into the issues and found solutions which all tied back to the soil.  
**[0:00:35-0:00:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:00:35):**  Now she continues to be a model for the high end fashion industry, but she uses her voice  
**[0:00:39-0:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:00:39):**  and her position to push for sustainable materials and practices, which are there.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:00:44):**  And while at the same time acting as a global ambassador to promote biodynamic farming and  
**[0:00:49-0:00:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:00:49):**  explain time and time again why it holds the solution to the issues we face, the climate  
**[0:00:55-0:01:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:00:55):**  crisis, biodiversity, water, health and more, and she has to explain time and time again  
**[0:01:00-0:01:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:01:00):**  why it's not a farming practice for quote unquote hippie weirdos.  
**[0:01:04-0:01:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:01:04):**  Enjoy!  
**[0:01:05-0:01:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:01:05):**  This is the Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food podcast, Investing as if the Planet  
**[0:01:13-0:01:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:01:13):**  Mattered, where we talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:01:17-0:01:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:01:17):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:01:23-0:01:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:01:23):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:27-0:01:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:01:27):**  Why my focus on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:30-0:01:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:01:30):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:33-0:01:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:01:33):**  our land and our sea, grow our food, what we eat, wear and consume.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:01:38):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:42-0:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:01:42):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.

**[0:02:21-0:02:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:02:21):**  Alliance and friend of the show, Arizona Muse.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:02:24):**  Welcome Arizona.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:02:25):**  Hello.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:02:26):**  It's so great to be here.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:02:27):**  I'm a longtime listener of the show and it's just such an honor to be chatting with you  
**[0:02:32-0:02:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:02:32):**  officially now.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:02:35):**  And of course people can Google you.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:02:39):**  There's a nice interview with Elle magazine actually, which I'll put in the show notes  
**[0:02:42-0:02:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:02:42):**  as well.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:02:43):**  But just to briefly, also not that briefly if you want to, a bit of your background.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:02:48):**  How did you roll into modeling first of all?  
**[0:02:50-0:02:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:02:50):**  And then when did this, I would say sustainability side first started?  
**[0:02:54-0:02:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:02:54):**  And then of course we'll go into the regenerative biodynamic side.  
**[0:02:56-0:03:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:02:56):**  But what started your sustainability journey?  
**[0:03:00-0:03:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:03:00):**  Was that one moment?  
**[0:03:01-0:03:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:03:01):**  Was that seeing certain things?  
**[0:03:04-0:03:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:03:04):**  Was it a gradual story?  
**[0:03:05-0:03:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:03:05):**  What was the trigger there to, because I think you can stay in the fashion industry for a  
**[0:03:11-0:03:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:03:11):**  very long time without looking at the sustainability side, but you decided to face it head on basically.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:03:16):**  Okay, since you're asking, I'll tell you a bit of my life story.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:03:21):**  I was born in Arizona, which is where I got the name.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:03:23):**  My mom is English and she was pregnant in the desert, in the Sonoran Desert in Tucson.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:03:29):**  And I think just was overwhelmed by the pregnancy maybe, but also by the beauty of the desert  
**[0:03:34-0:03:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:03:34):**  and decided to name me Arizona.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:03:36):**  Then I grew up in Santa Fe, New Mexico, which is highly populated by environmentalists.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:03:40):**  So I thought my worldview was that there are too many environmentalists.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:03:44):**  I'm going to go and do something more radical, like go into fashion.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:03:48):**  And so I became a model and then I realized that there was more for me and I found my  
**[0:03:57-0:04:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:03:57):**  passion at age 26, 27.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:04:01):**  And my passion is environmentalism, going right back to where I came from.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:04:06):**  And of course I learned what you would imagine that environmentalists are not overpopulated  
**[0:04:10-0:04:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:04:10):**  in the world.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:04:11):**  It's actually quite an underdog position to have taken and I love it so much.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:04:16):**  The work I'm able to do as an activist, I now call myself an activist proudly because  
**[0:04:21-0:04:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:04:21):**  that's what I'm doing.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:04:22):**  So I'll go back a step.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:04:23):**  I was invited to a lunch on biodiversity.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:04:27):**  This was the first moment for me when I was, I think 26 or 27 that I realized, wow, why  
**[0:04:33-0:04:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:04:33):**  isn't this word biodiversity being used?  
**[0:04:35-0:04:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:04:35):**  Why did you accept that?  
**[0:04:36-0:04:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:04:36):**  Why did you accept the lunch?  
**[0:04:37-0:04:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:04:37):**  I'm imagining you were invited for a lot of different things, say no to, and said no to  
**[0:04:42-0:04:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:04:42):**  a lot of things.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:04:43):**  It was pretty random.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:04:44):**  It was pretty random actually.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:04:45):**  It was a friend who invited me to, yeah, as you say, a charity lunch and I'd been to many  
**[0:04:49-0:04:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:04:49):**  and I just went and I was surprised that this word biodiversity wasn't being used in front  
**[0:04:53-0:04:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:04:53):**  of me frequently.  
**[0:04:54-0:04:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:04:54):**  In fact, this was the first time that I was really engaging with the word biodiversity  
**[0:04:59-0:05:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:04:59):**  and going, wow, why not?  
**[0:05:01-0:05:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:05:01):**  Why aren't we talking about this?  
**[0:05:03-0:05:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:05:03):**  This seems really important.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:05:05):**  So that for me was my beginning moment and then I started to research fashion and as  
**[0:05:11-0:05:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:05:11):**  you can imagine, found a lot of negative information, but also a lot of non-information.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:05:17):**  This was seven years ago and it was still relatively unknown that fashion was causing  
**[0:05:22-0:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:05:22):**  an immense amount of damage to ecosystems, human welfare, through the dying process,  
**[0:05:28-0:05:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:05:28):**  the growing process of fibers and leather, the tanning process of leather and all the  
**[0:05:33-0:05:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:05:33):**  transport that's involved.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:05:35):**  So there is immense, not to mention the packaging as well, immense waste and a lot of opacity  
**[0:05:42-0:05:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:05:42):**  around that waste.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:05:44):**  I didn't even know, though I had been at the core of the fashion industry for such a long  
**[0:05:49-0:05:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:05:49):**  time, I didn't even know how clothes were made and that really shocked me too.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:05:53):**  I was like, well, again, why not?  
**[0:05:55-0:05:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:05:55):**  Why don't I know this stuff?  
**[0:05:57-0:06:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:05:57):**  I've been in the showrooms and in the fittings for the shows of the biggest, most amazing  
**[0:06:02-0:06:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:06:02):**  fashion houses in the world.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:06:04):**  I got very lucky and my career went super well straight away and I've done campaigns  
**[0:06:08-0:06:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:06:08):**  for Prada and Chanel and so many of the other big fashion houses and been on the covers  
**[0:06:14-0:06:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:06:14):**  of Vogue for years and that is kind of crazy that I managed to do all of that without ever  
**[0:06:21-0:06:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:06:21):**  realizing the impact that this industry was really having.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:06:25):**  So I started to educate myself and I could never go back.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:06:29):**  I now say in my activism, knowledge protects you, knowledge protects you from making poor  
**[0:06:34-0:06:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:06:34):**  decisions, from making decisions that cause harm to the environment and to the people  
**[0:06:39-0:06:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:06:39):**  around you.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:06:41):**  The knowledge isn't scary, weirdly.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:06:43):**  I can tell you I am happier than I've ever been.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:06:47):**  I am more excited about life than I've ever been since I became an activist about climate  
**[0:06:53-0:06:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:06:53):**  change, about the climate crisis that we're all living through and that we're all causing  
**[0:06:58-0:06:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:06:58):**  in some way or another.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:06:59):**  I mean, have you flushed a toilet ever?  
**[0:07:03-0:07:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:07:03):**  Do you eat food?  
**[0:07:04-0:07:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:07:04):**  Okay, you're a part of the climate crisis.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:07:07):**  It's all of us and I think it's nice to just get that out there with a smile and a laugh  
**[0:07:11-0:07:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:07:11):**  because until you admit to yourself that you're causing problems, it's very easy to just kind  
**[0:07:20-0:07:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:07:20):**  of pretend they're on the other side of the room or the other side of the world even worse  
**[0:07:25-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:07:25):**  and that it's not really up to me.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:07:26):**  I'm just one tiny drop in the ocean.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:07:28):**  I can't really do much.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:07:29):**  I don't really have a big impact.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:07:31):**  All those little things that we tell ourselves, it's just not true.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:07:34):**  Each one of us has an immense impact.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:07:36):**  I'll give you my plastic water bottle example that I love that if I make it a policy in  
**[0:07:41-0:07:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:07:41):**  my life that I don't drink water from plastic bottles, that means I will save thousands  
**[0:07:48-0:07:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:07:48):**  of plastic bottles over my lifetime.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:07:51):**  Suddenly you realize it makes a difference.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:07:52):**  Whereas that one time that you're like, oh, I'm not going to buy the plastic water bottle.  
**[0:07:55-0:07:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:07:55):**  You're like, oh, it doesn't really make a difference.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:07:57):**  But over the course of your lifetime, it makes an immense difference.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:08:01):**  Now think of your bathrooms.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:08:03):**  How many do you have plus your kitchen sink?  
**[0:08:06-0:08:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:08:06):**  Do they all have plastic soap bottles sitting there next to them or do they have bars of  
**[0:08:10-0:08:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:08:10):**  soap that were unwrapped and that sit on soap dishes?  
**[0:08:13-0:08:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:08:13):**  Now imagine those three or four bathrooms maybe and the kitchen sink and over the course  
**[0:08:19-0:08:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:08:19):**  of your entire lifetime, wow, that's a lot of plastic bottles.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:08:25):**  So just always think about plastic battles.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:08:28):**  Probably actually in restaurants, et cetera, or with other people, let's say the plastic  
**[0:08:32-0:08:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:08:32):**  bottle becomes sometimes a plastic battle, but it's very, very interesting.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:08:35):**  And the signaling effect I think is super strong.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:08:37):**  And I want to take it one step backwards because you said I became a model.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:08:41):**  I went into the heart of the fashion industry.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:08:44):**  Did you do that with the idea of stepping away from the environmental, let's say scene  
**[0:08:49-0:08:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:08:49):**  or bubble you grew up in, or was it really, okay, I want to be as far away as possible,  
**[0:08:53-0:08:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:08:53):**  or I want to learn maybe among an industry that's not really known.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:08:57):**  Like did you do it with an idea of on the sustainability side or just I want to be far  
**[0:09:03-0:09:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:09:03):**  away from home.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:09:04):**  I want to go into a very different lifestyle, a very different.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:09:07):**  And then what happened there to sort of pulled you back to the environmentalist.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:09:10):**  Was there a trigger?  
**[0:09:11-0:09:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:09:11):**  Was it because you could have done the modeling, quote unquote thing for a long time without  
**[0:09:16-0:09:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:09:16):**  ever worrying about the waste.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:09:17):**  But something triggered there, not the biodiversity lunch, I think it was already before that,  
**[0:09:22-0:09:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:09:22):**  that like, wow, this is a very, very wasteful industry or an industry that really needs  
**[0:09:27-0:09:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:09:27):**  to look in a mirror literally and see what's happening.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:09:31):**  What triggered that?  
**[0:09:32-0:09:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:09:32):**  Or did you know that already from basically where you grew up?  
**[0:09:36-0:09:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:09:36):**  So my entrance into modeling, like many models, was very random.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:09:40):**  I happened to be a certain height and I happened to look in quotes pretty for this era.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:09:44):**  I mean, look at how beauty across the ages in history has really changed so much.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:09:49):**  So it's really very random and I really mean that I just happened to be in the right time  
**[0:09:55-0:09:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:09:55):**  in the right place.  
**[0:09:56-0:09:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:09:56):**  But also it's caused a lot of problems in my life.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:09:57):**  So I don't want to say that I'm I'm grateful for some of the things that it brought, but  
**[0:10:02-0:10:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:10:02):**  it also brought me down in many, many ways emotionally, physically.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:10:08):**  It's not a job that builds people up and it's not an industry that builds people up.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:10:12):**  And that can cause a lot of problems.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:10:13):**  And just my self-esteem was extremely, extremely low, which is contrary to what you might think  
**[0:10:19-0:10:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:10:19):**  of a model.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:10:20):**  Like I looked at all the pictures of me and just saw the problems and the flaws.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:10:24):**  I didn't think of myself as being, wow, amazing.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:10:27):**  Oh, she looks so good.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:10:29):**  Not at all.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:10:30):**  So it was causing immense kind of trauma on my mental health and the way I thought of  
**[0:10:36-0:10:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:10:36):**  myself, which was paralyzing.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:10:39):**  So I also feel like this moment where I found this purpose in life was tremendously valuable  
**[0:10:45-0:10:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:10:45):**  to me as a person, my growth, my development.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:10:49):**  It's just it brought me out of that, which was and now I can move and I can think and  
**[0:10:53-0:10:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:10:53):**  my brain works so much better.  
**[0:10:55-0:11:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:10:55):**  And it's really it's amazing to me to realize that you can, one can, anyone can really find  
**[0:11:03-0:11:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:11:03):**  themselves later on.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:11:05):**  Like I didn't I was quite directionless in my 20s and didn't really know.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:11:10):**  I had absolutely no idea what I wanted to do.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:11:12):**  And I was in a very high powered career that was taking so much time.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:11:17):**  I mean, to give one example, in Milan Fashion Week, you have drivers because the public  
**[0:11:23-0:11:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:11:23):**  transport isn't great.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:11:24):**  And you say my driver drove for one hundred and twelve hours that week.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:11:29):**  That means that I was working one hundred and twelve hours that week because my driver  
**[0:11:33-0:11:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:11:33):**  would drive me to all the appointments I had and wait outside while I had the appointment.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:11:36):**  And then I'd get in the car and drive again.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:11:38):**  It's a whole culture, the model driver culture during Milan Fashion Week.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:11:41):**  And actually, for let's say the public transport in Milan is pretty good, but of course, not  
**[0:11:46-0:11:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:11:46):**  that fast and not that direct.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:11:48):**  You can have it even.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:11:49):**  Oh, yeah.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:11:50):**  Sorry.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:11:51):**  No, I'm not.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:11:52):**  It's not like Milanese public transport at all.  
**[0:11:53-0:12:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:11:53):**  But yeah, if you have to do 120 hours of work, you cannot go subway and train in, bus in  
**[0:12:00-0:12:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:12:00):**  and out.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:12:01):**  You need a driver.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:12:02):**  And that's that's a lot of hours.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:12:05):**  I think people forget that they see the pictures and they don't see.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:12:08):**  I mean, in general, they see the piece of fashion, they see the piece of food, they  
**[0:12:13-0:12:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:12:13):**  see the picture and they don't see a hundred hours that go into that.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:12:17):**  Or the 65 people that go are in the background on every shoot and that nobody sees.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:12:23):**  It's this industry is so enormous when it comes to energy, human energy, fossil fuel  
**[0:12:32-0:12:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:12:32):**  energy and just and time energy.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:12:34):**  It's really, really a big deal, which is why it carries such tremendous importance in the  
**[0:12:40-0:12:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:12:40):**  face of climate change and the solutions.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:12:43):**  And there are incredible solutions that are being found in the sustainable fashion industry.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:12:49):**  And at the moment, it still seems like the sustainable fashion industry is separate from  
**[0:12:52-0:12:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:12:52):**  the normal fashion industry.  
**[0:12:54-0:13:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:12:54):**  And my dear friend and mentor, Ursula de Castro, the founder of Fashion Revolution, has a great  
**[0:13:00-0:13:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:13:00):**  quote where she says she would prefer that the sustainable fashion industry were just  
**[0:13:05-0:13:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:13:05):**  called the fashion industry.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:13:07):**  And the other one was called the unsustainable fashion industry.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:13:10):**  And I just I think that's such a perfect encapsulation of the future we need to move to.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:13:15):**  Like this, what we do needs to become normal.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:13:18):**  Do you remember the first time you saw like potential solutions?  
**[0:13:25-0:13:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:13:25):**  Because you started to go deep into, let's say, the issues, quote unquote, not actually  
**[0:13:29-0:13:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:13:29):**  the issues of the fashion industry.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:13:31):**  You said, I stumbled upon or I found many solutions and different materials and things.  
**[0:13:35-0:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:13:35):**  And do you remember that first one that you said, wow, it's actually possible to do it  
**[0:13:39-0:13:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:13:39):**  in another way?  
**[0:13:40-0:13:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:13:40):**  And do you remember that moment?  
**[0:13:41-0:13:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:13:41):**  Like, OK, this is this potentially is a positive story and not just let's make it a bit less  
**[0:13:46-0:13:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:13:46):**  dirty or a bit cleaner, but still it is in effect, it's fossil fuel, nylon, etc.  
**[0:13:53-0:13:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:13:53):**  Like, do you remember stumbling upon an example there that really triggered you into into  
**[0:13:57-0:13:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:13:57):**  the positive side of things?  
**[0:13:59-0:14:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:13:59):**  Definitely.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:14:00):**  On my birthday one year, September 18th, I met someone who became a tremendous mentor  
**[0:14:06-0:14:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:14:06):**  of mine, Nina Morenzi, who started the Sustainable Angle.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:14:09):**  And the Sustainable Angle is a London based organization whose advisory board I now sit  
**[0:14:13-0:14:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:14:13):**  on and whose sources sustainable materials for the fashion industry from all over the  
**[0:14:17-0:14:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:14:17):**  world.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:14:18):**  She's been doing this for almost 12 years now.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:14:20):**  It was not cool when she started at all.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:14:23):**  But she came from a degree in regenerative agriculture and she was reading about cotton  
**[0:14:29-0:14:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:14:29):**  and she realized, wow, this needs to change.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:14:32):**  We cannot continue growing cotton like this with all the water irrigation and all the  
**[0:14:37-0:14:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:14:37):**  pesticide and herbicide uses in order to make clothes that are sold for far too little money  
**[0:14:43-0:14:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:14:43):**  and do not reward anybody along their supply chain.  
**[0:14:47-0:14:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:14:47):**  So she set up the Sustainable Angle and it is providing a service that is invaluable  
**[0:14:51-0:14:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:14:51):**  to the fashion industry because many designers, if they start to learn about sustainability  
**[0:14:56-0:15:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:14:56):**  and they want to make a change, it was almost impossible to do so before the Sustainable  
**[0:15:01-0:15:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:15:01):**  Angle because looking for sustainable materials was like searching for a needle in a haystack.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:15:06):**  And they were impossible to find.  
**[0:15:08-0:15:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:15:08):**  They were not gathered into one place.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:15:10):**  So Nina has the Sustainable Angle where you can source sustainable fabrics all year round,  
**[0:15:15-0:15:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:15:15):**  but you can also go to the Future Fabrics Expo, which is once a year.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:15:18):**  It's coming up in June 2022.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:15:19):**  Very exciting in London.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:15:21):**  I love it.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:15:22):**  It's a hub of innovators.  
**[0:15:24-0:15:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:15:24):**  There's so many sustainable materials and they're the suppliers who make them, who you  
**[0:15:29-0:15:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:15:29):**  can talk to at their booths, but also seminars all day long with speakers from all over the  
**[0:15:34-0:15:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:15:34):**  world, digital and in person, talking about incredible innovations and solutions.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:15:40):**  Some of them are not yet on the market and some of them are commercially available.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:15:45):**  And so these materials, just to describe, she stumbled upon cotton as an enormous polluter.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:15:52):**  So how, what do you replace cotton with or how do you do cotton differently?  
**[0:15:56-0:15:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:15:56):**  Or maybe they're two different questions.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:15:58):**  What are examples of materials you're very excited about?  
**[0:16:01-0:16:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:16:01):**  We're talking now in spring 2022, stuff that is commercially available, which means at  
**[0:16:06-0:16:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:16:06):**  a certain scale, not enormous, but maybe at a certain scale that if you're running a fashion  
**[0:16:11-0:16:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:16:11):**  brand or you need materials and like what are exciting ones you've seen coming out over  
**[0:16:17-0:16:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:16:17):**  the last period?  
**[0:16:18-0:16:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:16:18):**  Well, the straightforward answer is that organic cotton is a much better solution than conventionally  
**[0:16:23-0:16:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:16:23):**  grown cotton.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:16:24):**  There are restrictions on irrigation and also there won't be the use of heavy duty chemicals.  
**[0:16:29-0:16:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:16:29):**  But a more exciting answer is that look first where you are localized.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:16:35):**  So are you in a desert?  
**[0:16:37-0:16:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:16:37):**  Cotton is a thirsty crop, but also likes hot weather.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:16:40):**  It's a disaster for climate change basically.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:16:42):**  So it's grown all over deserts and it's irrigated with water that should never have been pulled  
**[0:16:46-0:16:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:16:46):**  out of the river nearby.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:16:47):**  So going to crops that replace cotton that are grown in wetter climates where you don't  
**[0:16:54-0:17:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:16:54):**  need to irrigate such as flax and hemp, those crops are amazing for European countries because  
**[0:17:00-0:17:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:17:00):**  they can be and used to be grown widely all over Europe without any fertilization and  
**[0:17:06-0:17:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:17:06):**  without any irrigation.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:17:08):**  Unfortunately, what happened fairly recently in the last 40 some years is that all the  
**[0:17:14-0:17:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:17:14):**  processing equipment for hemp and for flax was bought by Asian countries, mostly Asian  
**[0:17:29-0:17:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:17:29):**  countries.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:17:30):**  So it doesn't any longer exist in Europe.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:17:32):**  So this is one of the contributors to why Europe doesn't grow its own flax and hemp  
**[0:17:37-0:17:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:17:37):**  anymore.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:17:38):**  Sometimes if you buy a piece of garment that is called kind of Belgian linen, usually it's  
**[0:17:43-0:17:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:17:43):**  not even grown in Belgium.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:17:45):**  It may be processed in Belgium still, but the growing is very likely to have happened  
**[0:17:51-0:17:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:17:51):**  in India or in China and the processing will have happened there too, which is great for  
**[0:17:56-0:17:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:17:56):**  localization of processing.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:17:57):**  The processing equipment should always be near to where the material was grown, but  
**[0:18:03-0:18:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:18:03):**  we need to get that back into Europe.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:18:04):**  So whether it's building new machines for Europe or buying them back and distributing  
**[0:18:09-0:18:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:18:09):**  them more evenly around the world, that would help hugely to reduce our reliance on cotton.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:18:18):**  And something interesting happened in the US around cotton, horribly and interesting,  
**[0:18:24-0:18:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:18:24):**  is that it was really used as a defense mechanism to bring down the lives of people of color  
**[0:18:29-0:18:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:18:29):**  in the US.  
**[0:18:30-0:18:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:18:30):**  It was weaponized because originally in the US, again, hemp and flax were grown widely  
**[0:18:36-0:18:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:18:36):**  and they're very resilient to drought and wetness and they're just an amazing crop  
**[0:18:41-0:18:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:18:41):**  basically.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:18:42):**  And the processing can be done locally without any chemicals.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:18:45):**  And then they were replaced by cotton, which is a hugely vulnerable crop.  
**[0:18:49-0:18:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:18:49):**  And so it needs pesticides and herbicides and it needs different machinery and it needs  
**[0:18:53-0:18:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:18:53):**  irrigation and it needs lots of tending.  
**[0:18:55-0:18:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:18:55):**  It's much more time intensive.  
**[0:18:56-0:19:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:18:56):**  So this is historically a really big deal in the social history of the US.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:19:02):**  The perfect solution for slavery basically.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:19:04):**  That's the answer.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:19:06):**  If you want to tie people to the land and chemicals to the land, you use cotton.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:19:11):**  In service, it works really well and it worked really well.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:19:16):**  So moving away from cotton is important socially and environmentally and in terms of logistics  
**[0:19:22-0:19:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:19:22):**  and transport.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:19:24):**  We don't need to be growing so much cotton.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:19:27):**  We can reduce our need for cotton by transitioning to these other materials.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:19:31):**  And that may not be 100 percent.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:19:34):**  The feeling of hemp is different than cotton.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:19:36):**  It can be refined to be smooth, but also you can just blend it with cotton.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:19:41):**  So you could reduce your cotton intake by half by just blending it with with a hemp  
**[0:19:45-0:19:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:19:45):**  material.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:19:46):**  So that is is a really fantastic solution.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:19:49):**  Also, hemp for fiber needs to be separated away from hemp for CBD and THC because if  
**[0:19:57-0:20:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:19:57):**  you see them as one plant and one species, you're you're going to outlaw hemp, which  
**[0:20:04-0:20:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:20:04):**  is again what happened in many, many countries.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:20:06):**  People were required to stop growing this traditional fabric material because of the  
**[0:20:13-0:20:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:20:13):**  FDA's of the world, because of the drug administrations of the world who said, no, no, no, you can't  
**[0:20:18-0:20:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:20:18):**  grow that anymore.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:20:19):**  And everyone's like, yeah, but it doesn't produce a drug.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:20:20):**  And they're like, it doesn't matter.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:20:21):**  It's the same family.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:20:22):**  It's the same family.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:20:23):**  You know, just like these kind of big stupidities that in the end changed the course of history  
**[0:20:30-0:20:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:20:30):**  in such a dramatically negative way.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:20:32):**  We need to examine this and look at how we can how we can fix that and how we can go  
**[0:20:38-0:20:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:20:38):**  back to growing these fashion materials that are so much easier on the environment and  
**[0:20:44-0:20:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:20:44):**  on human welfare as well.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:20:47):**  And do they fit because I'm really not obviously a fashion material expert like flax and hemp  
**[0:20:54-0:20:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:20:54):**  and linen to a certain extent as well.  
**[0:20:56-0:20:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:20:56):**  Do they fit into these in the rotations we would like farmers to do?  
**[0:20:59-0:21:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:20:59):**  Like this is an easy, I would say, plug in, quote unquote, almost to do that today.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:21:05):**  Also produce food is like, where does the fiber rich come from?  
**[0:21:08-0:21:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:21:08):**  Is it you harvest or food or fiber when it comes to flax?  
**[0:21:10-0:21:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:21:10):**  Because I think you can flex it, you can also eat them.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:21:13):**  Like how does it would that look like in Europe, for instance, would it be a relatively easy  
**[0:21:18-0:21:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:21:18):**  way to integrate them?  
**[0:21:19-0:21:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:21:19):**  Of course, then there's the processing, which has to come, which probably needs some new  
**[0:21:23-0:21:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:21:23):**  machinery, smaller, more localized, etc.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:21:26):**  So that I'm imagining with a lot of the new robotics, etc. that should be possible.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:21:31):**  But does it fit easily into into the current rotations that many organic farmers and biodynamic  
**[0:21:37-0:21:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:21:37):**  farmers need to do to keep to keep their soil going?  
**[0:21:40-0:21:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:21:40):**  Is it is it an easy sell, let's say to to the farming community, or at least the advanced  
**[0:21:44-0:21:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:21:44):**  farming community?  
**[0:21:47-0:21:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:21:47):**  About the question of food and fiber, we should definitely ask about an economic farmer because  
**[0:21:51-0:21:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:21:51):**  I don't know if it's the same species of flax that makes linen as you can eat the seeds  
**[0:21:56-0:21:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:21:56):**  in the oil.  
**[0:21:58-0:21:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:21:58):**  It could be.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:21:59):**  I don't want to answer incorrectly.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:22:02):**  But from an investment point of view, I can answer that question and say one need for  
**[0:22:06-0:22:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:22:06):**  investment is to invest into the infrastructure of the processing of these materials.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:22:11):**  Like I mentioned before, we need to build new machinery for Europe or we need to buy  
**[0:22:16-0:22:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:22:16):**  the machinery back from the country.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:22:17):**  And the brands are there too, like the brands are there, let's say the machinery would be  
**[0:22:21-0:22:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:22:21):**  invested in and would be built.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:22:23):**  Do you see strong interest from brands that want this transparency coming from Europe,  
**[0:22:30-0:22:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:22:30):**  that wants this localized stream?  
**[0:22:34-0:22:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:22:34):**  Is there the potential of offtake?  
**[0:22:35-0:22:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:22:35):**  Which is the same discussion in food, obviously.  
**[0:22:37-0:22:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:22:37):**  Yeah, we should bring back this, we should grow this.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:22:39):**  But always the question is, OK, is there at least a front runner market ready to buy these  
**[0:22:45-0:22:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:22:45):**  things, which makes it a lot easier to sell to farmers?  
**[0:22:48-0:22:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:22:48):**  Sustainable fashion is a hot topic now.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:22:50):**  Everyone's interested, everyone wants to participate, but brands don't have the money to buy this  
**[0:22:56-0:22:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:22:56):**  machinery.  
**[0:22:57-0:22:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:22:57):**  It's super expensive.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:22:58):**  It's like millions of euros are needed to invest in this machinery.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:23:01):**  It's not cheap.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:23:02):**  They're very big machines.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:23:03):**  They process a lot at once.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:23:05):**  And it's a hefty investment to buy one even and then to the logistics around it.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:23:11):**  So we need financing for this to work.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:23:15):**  We need, in general, in the sustainable fashion movement, it's relatively small businesses.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:23:22):**  And in the unsustainable fashion industry, it's relatively big businesses.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:23:26):**  So right now, we need to encourage the big businesses to move into the sustainable fashion  
**[0:23:31-0:23:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:23:31):**  industry to start putting their orders in and behind and guarantee or commit to making  
**[0:23:37-0:23:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:23:37):**  orders once these technologies become available and to just express their interest.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:23:42):**  That would help so much.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:23:43):**  So that's I think activism is the answer for that, is getting people to talk about this  
**[0:23:48-0:23:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:23:48):**  and getting people to be inspired by the idea that they can change the world.  
**[0:23:54-0:23:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:23:54):**  And this is what I love about the consulting that I do to transition fashion brands to  
**[0:23:57-0:24:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:23:57):**  become more sustainable is the look on people's faces when you explain to them how they can  
**[0:24:02-0:24:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:24:02):**  be heroes.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:24:03):**  And I mean that they can literally change the world through their business.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:24:06):**  But right now they're causing problems with it.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:24:09):**  And it's not as difficult.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:24:10):**  So describe how it works.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:24:12):**  They ask you to become a consultant or I'm imagining you also give your opinion, let's  
**[0:24:17-0:24:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:24:17):**  say unquestioned when you're unasked when you're in these meetings.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:24:20):**  You say, did you know that you could become a hero or how do you approach that when you  
**[0:24:24-0:24:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:24:24):**  are, let's say, in a boardroom of a large, large, semi-large fashion brand?  
**[0:24:30-0:24:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:24:30):**  I definitely start chatting about it on photo shoots all the time.  
**[0:24:34-0:24:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:24:34):**  And this is a question I get asked a lot, actually.  
**[0:24:37-0:24:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:24:37):**  Like, how do I feel and how do I reconcile working with brands who are causing damage,  
**[0:24:42-0:24:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:24:42):**  who are not sustainable, working with them as a model with my activism?  
**[0:24:47-0:24:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:24:47):**  And at the moment, I still feel like it's necessary to take modeling work with brands  
**[0:24:51-0:24:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:24:51):**  who are not sustainable because it gives me an access point that I would never have otherwise.  
**[0:24:57-0:25:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:24:57):**  I mean, it's just it's incredible to walk into a shoot and be with head designers and  
**[0:25:00-0:25:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:25:00):**  CEOs and chat all day, chit chat chat about how amazing sustainability is and what they  
**[0:25:06-0:25:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:25:06):**  can do and all these fun innovations around materials and how it just isn't as difficult  
**[0:25:11-0:25:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:25:11):**  or as scary as they may have thought.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:25:13):**  And one big issue in consulting now is screenwashing that many, many businesses are starting to  
**[0:25:20-0:25:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:25:20):**  feel like they can just talk about sustainability, whether or not they've done anything.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:25:25):**  And my biggest piece of advice for that for anybody is only talk about the things you've  
**[0:25:31-0:25:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:25:31):**  already done.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:25:32):**  Do not talk about your ambitions and do not celebrate your ambitions because an ambition  
**[0:25:38-0:25:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:25:38):**  is something in the future.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:25:39):**  Net zero in 2050 and nonsense like that.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:25:41):**  That you've never done.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:25:43):**  Yeah.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:25:44):**  So you will get criticized on that because the press now and the media are so much better  
**[0:25:48-0:25:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:25:48):**  educated than they were even last year, even three years ago.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:25:52):**  People will find you out because also consumers are educating themselves.  
**[0:25:55-0:26:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:25:55):**  They want to buy from businesses that are doing something better and at least are showing  
**[0:26:00-0:26:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:26:00):**  the progress that they're making.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:26:02):**  And setting ambitions and targets is not the same as making progress.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:26:07):**  I've even seen situations from very big institutions that I probably shouldn't name, but who have  
**[0:26:14-0:26:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:26:14):**  increased the gravity of their ambitions without even explaining what they've already achieved  
**[0:26:20-0:26:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:26:20):**  on their ambitions from last year.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:26:22):**  I'm like, what?  
**[0:26:23-0:26:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:26:23):**  That makes no sense at all.  
**[0:26:26-0:26:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:26:26):**  That makes no sense.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:26:28):**  And I'm supposed to sit here and clap?  
**[0:26:31-0:26:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:26:31):**  That's not okay.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:26:32):**  That is not progress.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:26:33):**  So yeah, greenwashing, I think that's the biggest solution is just don't talk about  
**[0:26:37-0:26:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:26:37):**  anything that you haven't done yet.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:26:40):**  And has it shifted?  
**[0:26:43-0:26:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:26:43):**  In food you see that, let's say the smaller or medium sized companies, we just had an  
**[0:26:47-0:26:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:26:47):**  interview, it might be out already when this will air, with Grounded, with Gijsboers and  
**[0:26:53-0:27:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:26:53):**  on really regeneratively grown or used regenerative practices, pepper and other spices and tea,  
**[0:27:01-0:27:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:27:01):**  et cetera, from Sub-Saharan Africa.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:27:03):**  And they supply to a lot of brands in Europe that they see these middle sized brands that  
**[0:27:07-0:27:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:27:07):**  really want transparency, want this good story, but also want certain quality and certain  
**[0:27:13-0:27:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:27:13):**  size because they're not tiny, tiny startup.  
**[0:27:15-0:27:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:27:15):**  They're not an enormous unilever, but they're sort of in the middle.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:27:18):**  And they seem to really be taking off.  
**[0:27:20-0:27:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:27:20):**  They're growing fast.  
**[0:27:21-0:27:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:27:21):**  The consumer is really embracing, the front runner consumer obviously is embracing, are  
**[0:27:26-0:27:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:27:26):**  embracing these brands.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:27:28):**  Is that happening as well in the fashion side?  
**[0:27:31-0:27:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:27:31):**  Like that the consumer starts to, and does the big brands start to worry because they're  
**[0:27:34-0:27:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:27:34):**  actually starting to choose other things?  
**[0:27:36-0:27:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:27:36):**  Do you see that as being, is the pace increasing?  
**[0:27:40-0:27:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:27:40):**  Because of course the small ones were always there, but are they starting to become slightly  
**[0:27:44-0:27:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:27:44):**  a bigger force in the space and thus more serious?  
**[0:27:48-0:27:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:27:48):**  Or are we not there yet on this sort of tipping, almost tipping point, I would say.  
**[0:27:51-0:27:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:27:51):**  So what seems to be happening in fashion is that when these bigger businesses get involved,  
**[0:27:56-0:28:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:27:56):**  they usually want to do a capsule collection with sustainable materials, which is kind  
**[0:28:01-0:28:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:28:01):**  of annoying if I may say so myself.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:28:04):**  Which means they do one collection with materials, but they leave it out.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:28:07):**  They do one tiny collection.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:28:08):**  It's not even their main collection or their whole season.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:28:11):**  They just do six pieces with one sustainable material and then they get to enjoy the PR  
**[0:28:18-0:28:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:28:18):**  off of that.  
**[0:28:19-0:28:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:28:19):**  And it's just not real.  
**[0:28:21-0:28:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:28:21):**  It's not truthful and it's not honest.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:28:23):**  So I don't suggest that brands do this.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:28:26):**  It's more impactful to say, if you're a big brand, just change your lining material.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:28:33):**  Make sure that you're sourcing organic lining for your entire collection.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:28:37):**  What is lining for every fashion dummy that's listening?  
**[0:28:41-0:28:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:28:41):**  I used to think that a coat say is made of wool.  
**[0:28:44-0:28:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:28:44):**  Okay, done.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:28:45):**  No, not at all.  
**[0:28:47-0:28:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:28:47):**  A coat is made of a wool outer.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:28:48):**  It has plastic buttons.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:28:50):**  It has a lining made of probably Lyocell or silk if it's expensive.  
**[0:28:54-0:28:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:28:54):**  It has fusing to keep the lining together with the outer material.  
**[0:28:58-0:28:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:28:58):**  It has shoulder pads.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:28:59):**  It may have a zip as well.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:29:01):**  It may have come in a carrier bag made out of a synthetic polyester.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:29:04):**  Like, wow, so many materials.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:29:07):**  So imagine an entire collection of a really big business.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:29:10):**  They've used a lining, a fashion business, they've used a lining material, which is usually  
**[0:29:14-0:29:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:29:14):**  made from trees or from cotton.  
**[0:29:17-0:29:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:29:17):**  Trees would be Lyocell or a sustainable version is Tencel.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:29:20):**  And they buy that one material in huge quantities because they're going to line their whole  
**[0:29:26-0:29:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:29:26):**  collection with it.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:29:27):**  So that makes an impact.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:29:29):**  When you change-  
**[0:29:30-0:29:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:29:30):**  So that's the entry point you would say, okay, the lowest hanging fruit.  
**[0:29:31-0:29:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:29:31):**  I would say that's the best one.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:29:33):**  Take your biggest spend as a fashion brand, whatever material that is, your highest quantity,  
**[0:29:40-0:29:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:29:40):**  your highest quantity order and change that.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:29:42):**  You won't get the biggest PR impact though, because who wants to tell a story about all  
**[0:29:46-0:29:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:29:46):**  this lining that's sustainable?  
**[0:29:48-0:29:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:29:48):**  Like I get it from a PR point of view, it's not as valuable, but it's truthful and it's  
**[0:29:51-0:29:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:29:51):**  honest and that's you making the biggest deal, which I would argue that consumers now do  
**[0:29:56-0:29:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:29:56):**  want to hear stories like that.  
**[0:29:58-0:30:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:29:58):**  That's actually a more interesting story because it educates as well.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:30:00):**  It doesn't misguide the consumer.  
**[0:30:03-0:30:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:30:03):**  Another story that I wanted to tell off the back of this question is about how these businesses  
**[0:30:08-0:30:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:30:08):**  that are larger can start to really, truly support their supply chain and the farmers  
**[0:30:13-0:30:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:30:13):**  down at the bottom end of their supply chain.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:30:16):**  Bottom not being derogatory at all, but bottom being baseline, like at the beginning of the  
**[0:30:21-0:30:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:30:21):**  story where the materials were grown.  
**[0:30:24-0:30:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:30:24):**  Build relationships with them that go beyond just visiting the farm.  
**[0:30:28-0:30:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:30:28):**  This I've heard from farmers a lot, especially I'm thinking particularly of an amazing farm  
**[0:30:33-0:30:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:30:33):**  in the US that is 10,000 acres in Northern Montana on the border of Canada.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:30:39):**  It's incredible what they're doing.  
**[0:30:40-0:30:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:30:40):**  They are really working at the cusp of, at the height of regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:30:46-0:30:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:30:46):**  They want to transition into biodynamics.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:30:48):**  They're working with a lot of biodynamic methods already.  
**[0:30:50-0:30:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:30:50):**  So they are finding that the businesses that source their crops are really interested in  
**[0:30:56-0:30:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:30:56):**  the ways that they're growing.  
**[0:30:58-0:31:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:30:58):**  They even want to come and visit the farm and make sure that they're really growing  
**[0:31:01-0:31:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:31:01):**  them in these regenerative ways.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:31:03):**  But they don't want to make any different a commitment to this farm than they would  
**[0:31:08-0:31:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:31:08):**  any other normal supplier.  
**[0:31:09-0:31:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:31:09):**  So in fact, what they're doing is taking a lot of time away from the team when they  
**[0:31:13-0:31:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:31:13):**  come and visit.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:31:14):**  They're not paying for those visits.  
**[0:31:16-0:31:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:31:16):**  They're not adding value to the farm by visiting and they're not making commitments that are  
**[0:31:22-0:31:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:31:22):**  regenerative in the economic side of things.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:31:26):**  Meaning that they're not taking advantage of-  
**[0:31:28-0:31:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:31:28):**  They want to take pictures and that's it.  
**[0:31:30-0:31:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:31:30):**  Yeah.  
**[0:31:31-0:31:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:31:31):**  They're not, they're not experimenting with CSAs, community supported agriculture.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:31:36):**  They're not buying ahead of time.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:31:37):**  That would be the most helpful thing is what I'm finding for farmers is that farmers just  
**[0:31:43-0:31:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:31:43):**  imagine if you were growing something and you had to pay for the whole thing to be grown  
**[0:31:48-0:31:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:31:48):**  before you got money for it.  
**[0:31:49-0:31:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:31:49):**  Oh wait, that's our normal system.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:31:52):**  That's what every farmer has to do.  
**[0:31:53-0:31:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:31:53):**  Potentially three to six months later after you harvest it and you don't even know-  
**[0:31:57-0:31:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:31:57):**  It's not fair.  
**[0:31:58-0:31:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:31:58):**  Sometimes against prices, et cetera.  
**[0:31:59-0:32:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:31:59):**  No, no.  
**[0:32:00-0:32:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:32:00):**  It's not fair.  
**[0:32:01-0:32:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:32:01):**  Better off take agreements is one of the keys, but a big key, let's say to unlocking money.  
**[0:32:08-0:32:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:32:08):**  You mentioned just one step back to biodynamic.  
**[0:32:12-0:32:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:32:12):**  Do you remember when you stumbled upon biodynamic?  
**[0:32:14-0:32:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:32:14):**  It feels like the next phase.  
**[0:32:16-0:32:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:32:16):**  You were going deep into materials.  
**[0:32:19-0:32:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:32:19):**  Do you remember the first time you heard about biodynamic farming?  
**[0:32:22-0:32:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:32:22):**  What did you think and what was it really like?  
**[0:32:24-0:32:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:32:24):**  What was that meeting with biodynamic?  
**[0:32:26-0:32:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:32:26):**  Let's say how was that or how did that happen?  
**[0:32:29-0:32:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:32:29):**  I went to Steiner Waldorf schools.  
**[0:32:31-0:32:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:32:31):**  I knew about biodynamics as a child and spent the night on a biodynamic farm when I was  
**[0:32:36-0:32:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:32:36):**  10 in the US in Tucson, Arizona and Santa Fe, New Mexico.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:32:40):**  I knew about biodynamics my whole life and always thought it was great and then forgot  
**[0:32:45-0:32:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:32:45):**  about it when I went into fashion.  
**[0:32:47-0:32:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:32:47):**  When I started my sustainability journey, my mom reminded me.  
**[0:32:51-0:32:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:32:51):**  I was learning that everything in fashion, all this information that I was gathering  
**[0:32:58-0:33:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:32:58):**  kept leading me back to soil.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:33:00):**  It's all grown for us in soil.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:33:01):**  My mom at this point said, oh, why don't you go and spend some time on a biodynamic farm?  
**[0:33:05-0:33:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:33:05):**  Remember those?  
**[0:33:06-0:33:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:33:06):**  I started to do just that.  
**[0:33:08-0:33:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:33:08):**  That was when I fell in love with biodynamics, realized it was a climate solution and started  
**[0:33:14-0:33:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:33:14):**  Dirt, this charity that I now run, which is aiming or is there to support soil regeneration  
**[0:33:20-0:33:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:33:20):**  globally.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:33:21):**  The way that we do that is by supporting biodynamic farming initiatives all over the world.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:33:28):**  Very global and creating demand for biodynamic produce, raising awareness about what biodynamics  
**[0:33:35-0:33:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:33:35):**  is because there are so many confusions around what biodynamics is.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:33:39):**  Let's unpack.  
**[0:33:40-0:33:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:33:40):**  What would you...  
**[0:33:41-0:33:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:33:41):**  I would love to hear some of those stories, but let's start with anybody that doesn't  
**[0:33:45-0:33:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:33:45):**  know.  
**[0:33:46-0:33:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:33:46):**  I'll put some links in the show notes below.  
**[0:33:47-0:33:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:33:47):**  How would you describe biodynamic farming for, let's say on a photo shoot, you're being  
**[0:33:52-0:33:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:33:52):**  asked by the CEO, I heard about this biodynamic farming.  
**[0:33:54-0:33:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:33:54):**  What would you tell him or her?  
**[0:33:56-0:34:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:33:56):**  Unfortunately, some usually him, what this type of farming or what this approach almost  
**[0:34:03-0:34:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:34:03):**  to life actually is?  
**[0:34:04-0:34:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:34:04):**  What is it to you and how do you describe this normally to somebody that really doesn't  
**[0:34:09-0:34:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:34:09):**  know anything about this type of agriculture or agriculture in general?  
**[0:34:15-0:34:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:34:15):**  Biodynamic farming is one type of agriculture that can be used in any setting on land.  
**[0:34:22-0:34:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:34:22):**  It doesn't have to be to grow crops.  
**[0:34:24-0:34:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:34:24):**  It can be used to afforest an area.  
**[0:34:28-0:34:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:34:28):**  It can be used in ecosystem regeneration.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:34:31):**  It can be used to repair a mining scar.  
**[0:34:35-0:34:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:34:35):**  Biodynamic farming is a richly nutritious way to farm soil.  
**[0:34:39-0:34:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:34:39):**  It centers around composting and you need animal manure in order to build the most robust  
**[0:34:46-0:34:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:34:46):**  compost which feeds the micro life under soil.  
**[0:34:49-0:34:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:34:49):**  What's special about biodynamics that goes beyond its techniques and it could be said  
**[0:34:55-0:35:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:34:55):**  that biodynamics is an umbrella of regenerative agriculture and you can use all the regenerative  
**[0:35:00-0:35:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:35:00):**  techniques like agroforestry or rotational grazing, mobile grazing underneath that umbrella.  
**[0:35:07-0:35:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:35:07):**  What is different about biodynamics is the preparations.  
**[0:35:11-0:35:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:35:11):**  The preparations are nine liquid tinctures that are made on the farm and sprayed across  
**[0:35:16-0:35:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:35:16):**  the farm for very specific uses.  
**[0:35:18-0:35:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:35:18):**  One is sprayed on compost, six of them are sprayed on compost.  
**[0:35:21-0:35:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:35:21):**  One is sprayed on soil.  
**[0:35:23-0:35:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:35:23):**  One is sprayed on the leaves of the trees before they bud.  
**[0:35:26-0:35:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:35:26):**  Things like that, like super specific applications and they're all made of ingredients from  
**[0:35:30-0:35:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:35:30):**  mineral from plants and from animals and with very specific recipes at very specific times  
**[0:35:36-0:35:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:35:36):**  of year.  
**[0:35:38-0:35:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:35:38):**  This is the practice behind biodynamics.  
**[0:35:42-0:35:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:35:42):**  At the end of the time of the making of the preparations, you might bury them for six  
**[0:35:46-0:35:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:35:46):**  months and then dig them up and you've got this incredible rich humus that is just turbocharged  
**[0:35:52-0:35:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:35:52):**  micro life for soil and for fertility and for biodiversity.  
**[0:35:58-0:36:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:35:58):**  What biodynamics sees is that why biodynamics makes these preparations is for the life within  
**[0:36:04-0:36:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:36:04):**  plants.  
**[0:36:05-0:36:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:36:05):**  Because look at a plant, it's green, it's growing, you can sometimes even eat it, you  
**[0:36:10-0:36:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:36:10):**  can smell it.  
**[0:36:12-0:36:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:36:12):**  Everything in it is keeping it alive and we can see that when it dies.  
**[0:36:16-0:36:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:36:16):**  It looks very different.  
**[0:36:17-0:36:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:36:17):**  It's gray and shriveled.  
**[0:36:19-0:36:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:36:19):**  So that's the life force within it and biodynamics recognizes that there is one and you can farm  
**[0:36:23-0:36:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:36:23):**  it and you do that with the preparations.  
**[0:36:26-0:36:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:36:26):**  They work on the non-physical aspect of the plants, of the animals, of the humans and  
**[0:36:31-0:36:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:36:31):**  of the earth.  
**[0:36:32-0:36:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:36:32):**  This is the medicine for the earth that biodynamics has, which is extremely special right now  
**[0:36:38-0:36:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:36:38):**  in the face of climate change and these preparations were developed in 1924 as a remedy for climate  
**[0:36:44-0:36:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:36:44):**  change.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:36:45):**  And what happened to biodynamic farming that it would say didn't take?  
**[0:36:51-0:36:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:36:51):**  I mean, this we're starting to find out, like on the let's say the traditional academic  
**[0:36:57-0:37:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:36:57):**  scientific like are slowly catching up with this, let's say, and starting to scientifically  
**[0:37:03-0:37:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:37:03):**  prove all of these methods that there's a lot of it in it.  
**[0:37:06-0:37:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:37:06):**  And it's working at scale, at any scale.  
**[0:37:08-0:37:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:37:08):**  I mean, we've seen examples everywhere.  
**[0:37:11-0:37:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:37:11):**  And somehow, biodynamic farming, the moment you mention it, you always get this chug like,  
**[0:37:15-0:37:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:37:15):**  oh yeah, these are the weirdos in the corner.  
**[0:37:18-0:37:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:37:18):**  And it's really odd because it is such a practical set of practices.  
**[0:37:24-0:37:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:37:24):**  And somehow now it seems like regenerative agriculture is taking off and applying most  
**[0:37:29-0:37:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:37:29):**  of these, talking immensely about fermentation and all of that in life, in plants, in soil,  
**[0:37:35-0:37:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:37:35):**  et cetera.  
**[0:37:36-0:37:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:37:36):**  So why didn't that happen with biodynamic farming?  
**[0:37:38-0:37:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:37:38):**  Like what went, I wouldn't say wrong, but why did it take this weird curve to the right  
**[0:37:42-0:37:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:37:42):**  or the left into weirdo land instead of mainstream?  
**[0:37:46-0:37:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:37:46):**  We have an idea because you've studied this, you've looked deep into this and why did that  
**[0:37:52-0:37:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:37:52):**  turn happen?  
**[0:37:53-0:37:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:37:53):**  I definitely don't have the complete answer for that question, but I can ponder it for  
**[0:37:58-0:37:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:37:58):**  a while.  
**[0:37:59-0:38:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:37:59):**  It's nearly 100 years old.  
**[0:38:01-0:38:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:38:01):**  It's 98 years old right now.  
**[0:38:03-0:38:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:38:03):**  And organic agriculture came out of biodynamic agriculture and that's often misunderstood.  
**[0:38:09-0:38:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:38:09):**  It's kind of talked about that biodynamic agriculture builds on organic agriculture,  
**[0:38:15-0:38:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:38:15):**  but actually organic came out of biodynamics and was a simplification of biodynamics that  
**[0:38:20-0:38:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:38:20):**  served a purpose and has been amazing in marketing and changing the way we think about mostly  
**[0:38:27-0:38:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:38:27):**  food, not fashion as much.  
**[0:38:30-0:38:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:38:30):**  And right now I think we need a more complex solution for nature because nature is very  
**[0:38:36-0:38:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:38:36):**  complex and actually can't be simplified down into one specific formula.  
**[0:38:41-0:38:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:38:41):**  And often, not always, because there are some regenerative organic farmers who are doing  
**[0:38:44-0:38:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:38:44):**  incredible things, but often organic can be just the same formula as conventional, but  
**[0:38:52-0:38:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:38:52):**  a less toxic version than.  
**[0:38:54-0:39:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:38:54):**  So it's still plant the seed, fertilize the seed, harvest the crop, and plant the seed  
**[0:39:00-0:39:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:39:00):**  again.  
**[0:39:01-0:39:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:39:01):**  And it just follows this kind of circle that isn't really full of life and isn't really  
**[0:39:06-0:39:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:39:06):**  regenerating soil nor biodiversity around it.  
**[0:39:09-0:39:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:39:09):**  But to go back to your question, I think that the people who are attracted to biodynamics  
**[0:39:15-0:39:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:39:15):**  are wonderfully humble and don't value shouting about the amazing things that they're doing.  
**[0:39:23-0:39:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:39:23):**  And so that has naturally meant that the movement remains smaller and quite internally facing,  
**[0:39:28-0:39:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:39:28):**  which is quite a beautiful thing when you think about it.  
**[0:39:30-0:39:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:39:30):**  No one's showing off.  
**[0:39:31-0:39:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:39:31):**  Everyone's just doing their good work and it's amazing.  
**[0:39:35-0:39:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:39:35):**  So I invite everyone to get into biodynamics, go and learn about it, go and visit a biodynamic  
**[0:39:40-0:39:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:39:40):**  farm if they want you to visit, obviously.  
**[0:39:42-0:39:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:39:42):**  Be respectful.  
**[0:39:43-0:39:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:39:43):**  Farmers don't always want.  
**[0:39:44-0:39:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:39:44):**  Yeah, and do pay for it or buy a lot of things.  
**[0:39:47-0:39:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:39:47):**  Exactly.  
**[0:39:48-0:39:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:39:48):**  Offer something to them and be really grateful that you can go and spend time with them because  
**[0:39:53-0:39:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:39:53):**  they're amazing.  
**[0:39:54-0:39:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:39:54):**  Biodynamic farmers are the most intelligent people I've ever met or spent time with.  
**[0:39:58-0:40:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:39:58):**  I mean, what this practice does to humans is incredible.  
**[0:40:02-0:40:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:40:02):**  They're on another level of being human.  
**[0:40:05-0:40:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:40:05):**  Their conversations, the way they think, their observance of the land around them.  
**[0:40:09-0:40:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:40:09):**  It's very, very special.  
**[0:40:10-0:40:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:40:10):**  This quality of sensitivity is heightened and heightened when you're doing these biodynamic  
**[0:40:17-0:40:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:40:17):**  practices.  
**[0:40:18-0:40:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:40:18):**  What is very unique about it as well is that it is certified in many places.  
**[0:40:22-0:40:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:40:22):**  Like there is a certification, there is a certain standard that you have to, like before  
**[0:40:27-0:40:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:40:27):**  you can call yourself obviously biodynamically certified.  
**[0:40:31-0:40:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:40:31):**  How did that happen?  
**[0:40:32-0:40:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:40:32):**  And do you think it avoided the pitfalls of organic, which with the certification that  
**[0:40:37-0:40:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:40:37):**  they asked the government to come in, in the US specifically, but in other places as well,  
**[0:40:41-0:40:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:40:41):**  to certify it?  
**[0:40:42-0:40:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:40:42):**  And that led to, of course, a boom in organic, but also, let's say, the loss of the original  
**[0:40:47-0:40:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:40:47):**  principles.  
**[0:40:48-0:40:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:40:48):**  And like you said, it's just a less toxic version in many cases, in some cases it isn't.  
**[0:40:53-0:40:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:40:53):**  In many cases, it's very large scale, relatively extractive, large plowing machines, etc.  
**[0:40:59-0:41:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:40:59):**  It's not viewing the farm as a holistic entity or an holistic organism.  
**[0:41:04-0:41:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:41:04):**  Do you think that biodynamic certification has avoided that pitfall?  
**[0:41:09-0:41:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:41:09):**  The certifying body of biodynamics is called Demeter.  
**[0:41:13-0:41:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:41:13):**  And Demeter exists all over the world and is wonderfully independent of itself in a  
**[0:41:21-0:41:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:41:21):**  way.  
**[0:41:22-0:41:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:41:22):**  And I think that is a protection mechanism that we should really respect.  
**[0:41:26-0:41:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:41:26):**  So there are many, many entities of Demeter all over the world, most of which can offer  
**[0:41:31-0:41:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:41:31):**  the certification, some of which just promote biodynamics.  
**[0:41:34-0:41:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:41:34):**  But basically each territory around the world has its own Demeter.  
**[0:41:38-0:41:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:41:38):**  And that means that communication around the world can sometimes be a challenge to make  
**[0:41:44-0:41:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:41:44):**  it all the same.  
**[0:41:45-0:41:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:41:45):**  But it also, again, as I said, it protects from this unification, this centralization  
**[0:41:52-0:41:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:41:52):**  that can often lead to lower quality everything.  
**[0:41:56-0:42:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:41:56):**  So I really respect this about the biodynamic movement that they have maintained this autonomy  
**[0:42:00-0:42:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:42:00):**  in different regions, understanding that different regions have different needs.  
**[0:42:04-0:42:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:42:04):**  Nevertheless, the standard of the certification is equally as high everywhere in the world.  
**[0:42:11-0:42:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:42:11):**  And what would you tell to investors?  
**[0:42:14-0:42:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:42:14):**  Imagine we're in a large theater, we do this in person and the room is full of or the audience  
**[0:42:19-0:42:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:42:19):**  is full of investors that are curious, obviously, because otherwise they wouldn't have come.  
**[0:42:25-0:42:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:42:25):**  We're talking about soil, we're talking about life, we're talking about really good food  
**[0:42:29-0:42:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:42:29):**  and fibers and materials.  
**[0:42:30-0:42:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:42:30):**  What would you tell them when they walk out?  
**[0:42:32-0:42:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:42:32):**  Obviously, we're not giving investment advice, but when they walk out of that theater tonight  
**[0:42:36-0:42:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:42:36):**  after that, what should they do the next day?  
**[0:42:38-0:42:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:42:38):**  Should they visit that farm?  
**[0:42:39-0:42:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:42:39):**  Should they search for it?  
**[0:42:40-0:42:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:42:40):**  Where would they, where would you send them to learn more and to start getting active?  
**[0:42:45-0:42:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:42:45):**  Not maybe immediately buying a few million euros worth of flex processing machinery,  
**[0:42:50-0:42:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:42:50):**  but where would you send them to learn more where we definitely need more, let's say,  
**[0:42:55-0:42:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:42:55):**  investment resources in this space?  
**[0:42:56-0:42:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:42:56):**  Is it to grow the farms?  
**[0:42:58-0:43:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:42:58):**  Is it to grow the processing?  
**[0:43:02-0:43:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:43:02):**  Where would you send them to start getting to work?  
**[0:43:04-0:43:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:43:04):**  Well, there's something very interesting happening with Demeter and with biodynamics globally,  
**[0:43:10-0:43:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:43:10):**  which is that this is a certified, meaning all these farms are of a similar caliber all  
**[0:43:17-0:43:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:43:17):**  over the world.  
**[0:43:19-0:43:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:43:19):**  Think about carbon crediting and how that voluntary carbon market right now is a, I  
**[0:43:24-0:43:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:43:24):**  guess we could say mess sometimes.  
**[0:43:26-0:43:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:43:26):**  I was going to say the same.  
**[0:43:29-0:43:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:43:29):**  You were?  
**[0:43:30-0:43:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:43:30):**  Okay, good.  
**[0:43:31-0:43:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:43:31):**  It's a bit different, but it's a bit messy.  
**[0:43:33-0:43:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:43:33):**  It's all over the place.  
**[0:43:34-0:43:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:43:34):**  Let's put it that way kindly.  
**[0:43:35-0:43:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:43:35):**  It's all over the place because it's new and there are many conflicting views about it.  
**[0:43:41-0:43:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:43:41):**  First of all, and I'd like to highlight the indigenous point of view or many indigenous  
**[0:43:46-0:43:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:43:46):**  points of view is that the carbon market itself is deeply flawed because it's capitalistic.  
**[0:43:51-0:43:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:43:51):**  So when you put a value on something that is of nature, you are undermining its intrinsic  
**[0:43:59-0:44:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:43:59):**  value without its monetary value and that can be really dangerous.  
**[0:44:03-0:44:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:44:03):**  And let's listen to indigenous peoples because they are the wisdom holders.  
**[0:44:07-0:44:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:44:07):**  They have been protecting our earth forever and a lot of different groups of people have  
**[0:44:14-0:44:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:44:14):**  constantly trampled on their teachings, ways, knowledge, and themselves, their cultures.  
**[0:44:20-0:44:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:44:20):**  So that's just a caveat that I want to share that opinion that we need to take that into  
**[0:44:27-0:44:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:44:27):**  account as we look at the carbon market and the nature market.  
**[0:44:31-0:44:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:44:31):**  And biodynamics has a unique opportunity to be able to look at and consider its nature  
**[0:44:38-0:44:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:44:38):**  value because biodynamic farmers are offering so many services to the public good, so many.  
**[0:44:48-0:44:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:44:48):**  And it's not, but they only get paid for their crops.  
**[0:44:52-0:44:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:44:52):**  And that is something that is just really mind boggling me right now and how I want  
**[0:44:58-0:45:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:44:58):**  to find a solution for this.  
**[0:45:00-0:45:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:45:00):**  These biodynamic farmers deserve to be remunerated for the services that they are providing humanity  
**[0:45:05-0:45:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:45:05):**  and the earth.  
**[0:45:07-0:45:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:45:07):**  And those include things like water absorption and retention on biodynamic farms is so much  
**[0:45:11-0:45:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:45:11):**  higher than neighboring farms, always.  
**[0:45:14-0:45:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:45:14):**  Then reduction in fire because fires don't burn as well on a farm that is absorbing so  
**[0:45:21-0:45:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:45:21):**  much water.  
**[0:45:22-0:45:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:45:22):**  So those again, two very, very good solutions.  
**[0:45:26-0:45:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:45:26):**  They increase quality of life to farmers.  
**[0:45:30-0:45:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:45:30):**  Biodynamic farmers are not as vulnerable to the mental health issues that tragically,  
**[0:45:38-0:45:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:45:38):**  tragically, I mean, suicide rates in farming are higher than pretty much every national  
**[0:45:46-0:45:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:45:46):**  average.  
**[0:45:47-0:45:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:45:47):**  And it's horrific that these are the people who grow everything we need for us.  
**[0:45:52-0:45:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:45:52):**  And yet they're in such an impossible situation, mostly brought on by debt and the debt cycle  
**[0:45:57-0:46:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:45:57):**  comes from the purchasing of chemicals and genetically modified seed and heavy duty machinery,  
**[0:46:04-0:46:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:46:04):**  but they do feel so unwell and so pressurized that they're actually willing to take their  
**[0:46:09-0:46:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:46:09):**  life.  
**[0:46:10-0:46:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:46:10):**  I mean, it's just, this is so not okay.  
**[0:46:12-0:46:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:46:12):**  And as a society, we need to figure out a solution where we can start supporting farmers  
**[0:46:17-0:46:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:46:17):**  in a way that actually makes them feel good about their lives because of the services  
**[0:46:21-0:46:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:46:21):**  that they're providing.  
**[0:46:22-0:46:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:46:22):**  So to carry on with the list of the services that biodynamic farmers are providing, increased  
**[0:46:27-0:46:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:46:27):**  biodiversity on the farm and also farms act as a safe haven for endangered species because  
**[0:46:32-0:46:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:46:32):**  they can come and live on that farm without the spraying of chemicals, for instance.  
**[0:46:38-0:46:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:46:38):**  Whereas the list goes on and on, I've been able to find about 10 or 15 incredible services  
**[0:46:44-0:46:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:46:44):**  that farmers could be paid for.  
**[0:46:45-0:46:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:46:45):**  So I'm thinking about earth assets rather than carbon credits, because the mainstream  
**[0:46:52-0:46:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:46:52):**  climate narrative you may have noticed is in a bit of a carbon tunnel.  
**[0:46:57-0:47:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:46:57):**  People are only talking about carbon and when you only talk about carbon, you don't have  
**[0:47:01-0:47:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:47:01):**  time to talk about any of the other really, really, really important urgent aspects that  
**[0:47:05-0:47:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:47:05):**  we need to resolve in order to avoid a climate crisis.  
**[0:47:09-0:47:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:47:09):**  If we're talking about net zero by 2050, and that's the only thing we do, we won't win.  
**[0:47:15-0:47:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:47:15):**  Even if we sequestered all the extra atmospheric carbon tomorrow, we would still be in climate  
**[0:47:20-0:47:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:47:20):**  change because it is not only a carbon problem.  
**[0:47:22-0:47:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:47:22):**  It's also a pollution problem.  
**[0:47:24-0:47:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:47:24):**  It's also an ocean acidification problem.  
**[0:47:26-0:47:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:47:26):**  It's also a water cycle problem.  
**[0:47:28-0:47:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:47:28):**  A what?  
**[0:47:29-0:47:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:47:29):**  A water cycle problem.  
**[0:47:30-0:47:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:47:30):**  And there are people that argue.  
**[0:47:31-0:47:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:47:31):**  Yes, sure, it's a motorcycle problem too.  
**[0:47:32-0:47:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:47:32):**  But not the biggest one.  
**[0:47:37-0:47:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:47:37):**  You can do some meditation on that, on the motorcycle diaries.  
**[0:47:41-0:47:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:47:41):**  But I think there are people arguing even that carbon is a symptom of a broken water  
**[0:47:48-0:47:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:47:48):**  cycle, of our land being not full of life and thus full of water.  
**[0:47:52-0:47:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:47:52):**  And we should focus on water.  
**[0:47:53-0:47:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:47:53):**  Jena, I will put a link below, we interviewed him, makes a very strong point of most of  
**[0:47:57-0:48:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:47:57):**  the heating comes from a broken water cycle, not from carbon.  
**[0:48:01-0:48:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:48:01):**  To me, we shouldn't worry about carbon, but it is a very small piece or it's a piece of  
**[0:48:06-0:48:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:48:06):**  a much bigger puzzle.  
**[0:48:07-0:48:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:48:07):**  Yeah.  
**[0:48:08-0:48:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:48:08):**  But then how do we compensate for that without becoming the issue again of a capitalistic  
**[0:48:12-0:48:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:48:12):**  system or the issue again of what we've done so many times with indigenous peoples, et  
**[0:48:17-0:48:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:48:17):**  cetera, that we as soon as we put a price on it, let's say we also argue that if this  
**[0:48:22-0:48:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:48:22):**  forest is worth a billion, which Charles Eisenstein just brought up in a previous interview, which  
**[0:48:26-0:48:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:48:26):**  should be out of now, otherwise we'll link it below, then if we pay two billion for it,  
**[0:48:31-0:48:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:48:31):**  we should cut it down and we should develop that mine underneath.  
**[0:48:35-0:48:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:48:35):**  How do we avoid that reasoning of as soon as we put a price on it, it means that when  
**[0:48:40-0:48:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:48:40):**  we pay that price or more, we can do whatever we want with it.  
**[0:48:45-0:48:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:48:45):**  This is a whole different rabbit hole we go into, but what has your research until now?  
**[0:48:50-0:48:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:48:50):**  I'm not saying there should be an answer, et cetera.  
**[0:48:52-0:48:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:48:52):**  How would you approach that when we want to start paying as soon as possible biodynamic  
**[0:48:57-0:49:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:48:57):**  farmers and land stewards for the immense services?  
**[0:49:02-0:49:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:49:02):**  I also don't like the word ecosystem services, but let's say ecosystem services they provide.  
**[0:49:06-0:49:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:49:06):**  How do we start tomorrow without digging ourselves into another hole that we don't want to get  
**[0:49:11-0:49:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:49:11):**  into?  
**[0:49:12-0:49:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:49:12):**  Well, I think that to start in my space is the Demeter certification guarantees a certain  
**[0:49:19-0:49:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:49:19):**  quality of farming, so that therefore it's easier to say these farms are of a similar  
**[0:49:25-0:49:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:49:25):**  ilk and so we can guarantee that this is happening on these farms because it's part  
**[0:49:30-0:49:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:49:30):**  of our certification.  
**[0:49:32-0:49:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:49:32):**  These farmers deserve to be at least recognized.  
**[0:49:36-0:49:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:49:36):**  First of all, just recognize them for what they're doing.  
**[0:49:38-0:49:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:49:38):**  Then a later stage would be to actually pay them for what they're doing and maybe that  
**[0:49:42-0:49:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:49:42):**  needs to come out of subsidies.  
**[0:49:43-0:49:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:49:43):**  Maybe taxpayer money could go there.  
**[0:49:46-0:49:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:49:46):**  I would feel amazing.  
**[0:49:47-0:49:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:49:47):**  If I knew that my taxpayer money were going to ecosystem services that support farmers  
**[0:49:52-0:49:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:49:52):**  to grow richly nutritious food as a byproduct, amazing.  
**[0:49:56-0:49:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:49:56):**  How great would that be?  
**[0:49:58-0:49:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:49:58):**  Because right now I know-  
**[0:49:59-0:50:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:49:59):**  Instead of subsidies that are doing something very different.  
**[0:50:01-0:50:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:50:01):**  Right now I know where my taxpayer money is going when it comes to agricultural subsidies  
**[0:50:06-0:50:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:50:06):**  and I am personally through my taxes paying for the purchasing of immense amounts of chemicals  
**[0:50:12-0:50:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:50:12):**  that are destroying the earth when they're mined, when they're created in a lab, also  
**[0:50:15-0:50:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:50:15):**  in transport, also when they're applied to soil and insects and plants.  
**[0:50:21-0:50:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:50:21):**  It's just crazy that I'm paying for that and I don't want to be paying for that.  
**[0:50:27-0:50:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:50:27):**  I think that is the first shift and I want to recognize that I'm not saying take subsidies  
**[0:50:33-0:50:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:50:33):**  away from the farmers who are using those subsidies to survive.  
**[0:50:38-0:50:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:50:38):**  Not at all.  
**[0:50:39-0:50:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:50:39):**  I'm saying use subsidies to support farmers to transition to farm in a way that's nature  
**[0:50:44-0:50:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:50:44):**  friendly, hopefully biodynamic.  
**[0:50:47-0:50:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:50:47):**  Farmers want to farm this way.  
**[0:50:49-0:50:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:50:49):**  No farmer wants to destroy soil.  
**[0:50:51-0:50:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:50:51):**  No farmer is sitting on their land going, I want to kill all the micro life under the  
**[0:50:56-0:50:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:50:56):**  soil.  
**[0:50:57-0:50:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:50:57):**  Not at all.  
**[0:50:58-0:51:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:50:58):**  Farmers are really intelligent, amazing humans who are just stuck in a cycle that isn't a  
**[0:51:02-0:51:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:51:02):**  system that isn't working and we need to educate out of it and provide exits.  
**[0:51:08-0:51:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:51:08):**  I have two questions that I always like to ask based on that actually.  
**[0:51:13-0:51:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:51:13):**  What if you had a magic wand and you had one thing you could change?  
**[0:51:17-0:51:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:51:17):**  Could be in fashion, could be in land use, could be in general, could be global consciousness.  
**[0:51:22-0:51:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:51:22):**  Most people then say, yeah, I would like to change two things.  
**[0:51:24-0:51:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:51:24):**  I would like to force you to do one thing only, but if you have two, it's also fine.  
**[0:51:27-0:51:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:51:27):**  What would you change overnight?  
**[0:51:30-0:51:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:51:30):**  Tomorrow morning we all wake up and Arizona changed one thing.  
**[0:51:33-0:51:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:51:33):**  What would that be?  
**[0:51:34-0:51:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:51:34):**  Maybe we didn't know that you did it.  
**[0:51:35-0:51:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:51:35):**  Obviously, you don't need the credit.  
**[0:51:37-0:51:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:51:37):**  What if you had that amazing power and responsibility?  
**[0:51:40-0:51:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:51:40):**  What would that be?  
**[0:51:41-0:51:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:51:41):**  I'm smiling now because I'm going to go really radical on you and my activism is quite radical.  
**[0:51:46-0:51:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:51:46):**  I read the most radical people and I love it.  
**[0:51:49-0:51:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:51:49):**  The most radical makes the most sense.  
**[0:51:51-0:51:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:51:51):**  It's the most logical.  
**[0:51:52-0:51:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:51:52):**  What I'm going to say here is get ourselves out.  
**[0:51:56-0:52:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:51:56):**  I would if I had a magic wand, get ourselves out of this domination cycle.  
**[0:52:01-0:52:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:52:01):**  We are conditioned to think that domination is our status quo.  
**[0:52:06-0:52:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:52:06):**  We need to dominate.  
**[0:52:07-0:52:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:52:07):**  We do it in all our relationships, our relationship with the earth, our relationship with our  
**[0:52:11-0:52:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:52:11):**  children, our relationship with our friends and partners, our relationships professionally.  
**[0:52:15-0:52:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:52:15):**  They're all about domination built on domination.  
**[0:52:18-0:52:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:52:18):**  We need to change this around, learn from people like Rhianne Eisler, for instance,  
**[0:52:22-0:52:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:52:22):**  who wrote a whole book on the partnership way, which is one great asset when you're  
**[0:52:28-0:52:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:52:28):**  trying to learn how to relearn, recondition yourself into a more positive way of being  
**[0:52:33-0:52:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:52:33):**  because when you stop living in a dominating way, you have much more space to be curious.  
**[0:52:40-0:52:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:52:40):**  Your creativity can grow and you can make decisions that you would otherwise not have  
**[0:52:44-0:52:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:52:44):**  made.  
**[0:52:45-0:52:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:52:45):**  We need this in the face of climate change because climate change is a human behavioral  
**[0:52:49-0:52:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:52:49):**  problem.  
**[0:52:50-0:52:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:52:50):**  It's not a carbon problem as we were saying.  
**[0:52:53-0:52:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:52:53):**  It's just us.  
**[0:52:55-0:52:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:52:55):**  We need to change the way we think.  
**[0:52:58-0:52:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:52:58):**  There are many, many ways to do this.  
**[0:52:59-0:53:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:52:59):**  Go in and learn from indigenous peoples.  
**[0:53:01-0:53:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:53:01):**  They all know this.  
**[0:53:02-0:53:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:53:02):**  They've been doing this forever.  
**[0:53:04-0:53:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:53:04):**  If you're a white European descent person, you have indigenous roots too.  
**[0:53:08-0:53:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:53:08):**  It took me ages to realize this, but I used to think all the glorious people with brown  
**[0:53:14-0:53:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:53:14):**  skin, they have indigenous roots.  
**[0:53:17-0:53:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:53:17):**  I do too.  
**[0:53:18-0:53:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:53:18):**  Every one of us does.  
**[0:53:19-0:53:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:53:19):**  Look at the Druids if you're from Britain.  
**[0:53:21-0:53:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:53:21):**  They have incredible rituals and ways of thinking that are more distant, so it's harder to find  
**[0:53:27-0:53:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:53:27):**  the European ones because they got wiped out longer ago than the ones in North America,  
**[0:53:32-0:53:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:53:32):**  for instance, in South America.  
**[0:53:34-0:53:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:53:34):**  But that wisdom is what's going to fuel our future.  
**[0:53:38-0:53:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:53:38):**  It's the most exciting learning I've ever done.  
**[0:53:42-0:53:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:53:42):**  Just recently read a book.  
**[0:53:44-0:53:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:53:44):**  Yeah, very, very good.  
**[0:53:45-0:53:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:53:45):**  Read a book.  
**[0:53:46-0:53:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:53:46):**  I wouldn't say I mean, we're used to something on this podcast.  
**[0:53:51-0:53:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:53:51):**  I would definitely link the books of Rian below as well.  
**[0:53:55-0:53:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:53:55):**  I read a book.  
**[0:53:56-0:54:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:53:56):**  I'm going to remember the title probably, Talking for the Trees, I think, or Speak for  
**[0:54:00-0:54:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:54:00):**  the Trees on someone in Ireland that was the last one that got the traditional knowledge.  
**[0:54:06-0:54:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:54:06):**  She was specifically picked by the community that when the last standing forest in Ireland,  
**[0:54:13-0:54:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:54:13):**  which there are not many anymore, and especially now, and she was trained in everything.  
**[0:54:18-0:54:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:54:18):**  She was trained.  
**[0:54:19-0:54:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:54:19):**  She got all the, the full, as we would say now, download.  
**[0:54:21-0:54:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:54:21):**  But of course, then back in the days, she didn't.  
**[0:54:24-0:54:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:54:24):**  And she went into academia and slowly but surely in the US, she basically proved, scientifically  
**[0:54:29-0:54:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:54:29):**  proved all the things she learned already when she was a teenager, which is a fascinating  
**[0:54:33-0:54:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:54:33):**  short book.  
**[0:54:34-0:54:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:54:34):**  I'll put the title below in the show notes as well.  
**[0:54:37-0:54:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:54:37):**  And it was really, it's really interesting that because we need those bridges between  
**[0:54:41-0:54:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:54:41):**  and she was very, very lucky, and we are lucky because she wrote it down.  
**[0:54:44-0:54:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:54:44):**  And some things are because she mentioned a lot of the trees at the end, and a lot of  
**[0:54:48-0:54:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:54:48):**  the recipes, a lot of the healing.  
**[0:54:50-0:54:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:54:50):**  We don't know anymore because it got lost with the Celts, I think.  
**[0:54:54-0:54:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:54:54):**  And but there are still bridges back to that.  
**[0:54:56-0:55:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:54:56):**  Of course, it's longer ago than we would like to.  
**[0:55:00-0:55:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:55:00):**  But I know many farmers that in places start to go deep into old agricultural or architecture  
**[0:55:05-0:55:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:55:05):**  books to understand what was grown here and what made sense in places.  
**[0:55:09-0:55:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:55:09):**  People go back all the way to Roman times.  
**[0:55:10-0:55:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:55:10):**  But of course, we have to go back way further to start seeing, okay, what made sense here?  
**[0:55:14-0:55:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:55:14):**  What was the context?  
**[0:55:15-0:55:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:55:15):**  What was the place like?  
**[0:55:16-0:55:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:55:16):**  What, what grows well together?  
**[0:55:18-0:55:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:55:18):**  What doesn't?  
**[0:55:19-0:55:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:55:19):**  What makes, I mean, a lot of this has been developed, probably lost because it wasn't  
**[0:55:23-0:55:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:55:23):**  written down or it was written down and then burned at some point, or was just told in  
**[0:55:26-0:55:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:55:26):**  oral oral history.  
**[0:55:28-0:55:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:55:28):**  And unfortunately, we lost a lot of that.  
**[0:55:30-0:55:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:55:30):**  But there is still some of that around.  
**[0:55:33-0:55:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:55:33):**  And we need to really make sure we capture it and start reusing it and by that see how  
**[0:55:40-0:55:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:55:40):**  it works and if it works.  
**[0:55:41-0:55:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:55:41):**  Yeah, it holds so many answers and so many tips about what is going to work in the future.  
**[0:55:46-0:55:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:55:46):**  So thinking from an investment point of view, if you're looking for what really is going  
**[0:55:51-0:55:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:55:51):**  to be a climate resilient investment, learn all this about the indigenous people.  
**[0:55:56-0:55:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:55:56):**  I mean, all the secrets are hidden there so that then you can use that knowledge to apply  
**[0:55:59-0:56:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:55:59):**  it to what businesses are available right now to invest into the ones who are aligned  
**[0:56:04-0:56:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:56:04):**  with what indigenous people say those ones are going to succeed.  
**[0:56:09-0:56:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:56:09):**  And it's a perfect bridge to the second question.  
**[0:56:11-0:56:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:56:11):**  People are frequent listeners from the podcast.  
**[0:56:14-0:56:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:56:14):**  If you made it until now, you must be probably a frequent listener.  
**[0:56:17-0:56:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:56:17):**  How would you invest money if you let's say a billion dollars or billion euros?  
**[0:56:21-0:56:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:56:21):**  Let's keep it in Europe for now.  
**[0:56:22-0:56:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:56:22):**  I mean, you can invest it everywhere.  
**[0:56:24-0:56:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:56:24):**  If you had to put that to work, obviously, I'm not looking for the exact euro amounts  
**[0:56:28-0:56:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:56:28):**  behind the comma, etc.  
**[0:56:30-0:56:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:56:30):**  I don't care.  
**[0:56:31-0:56:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:56:31):**  I would care more about what would you prioritize?  
**[0:56:34-0:56:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:56:34):**  What would you what would be the main themes you would focus on in a short time or a longer  
**[0:56:40-0:56:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:56:40):**  time if you had to put this amount of money to work?  
**[0:56:45-0:56:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:56:45):**  Future tech solutions, looking at biomimicry, ocean regeneration, land regeneration, but  
**[0:56:51-0:56:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:56:51):**  not through technological machinery, because that is too costly to build the investment  
**[0:56:57-0:56:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:56:57):**  that it absorbs.  
**[0:56:58-0:57:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:56:58):**  First of all, I mean, the billions that go into making machines to regenerate.  
**[0:57:02-0:57:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:57:02):**  It doesn't make sense.  
**[0:57:03-0:57:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:57:03):**  Just do it with by putting that billion, those billions into people, because people need  
**[0:57:09-0:57:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:57:09):**  jobs and people do better things with money than machines do.  
**[0:57:12-0:57:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:57:12):**  Definitely.  
**[0:57:13-0:57:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:57:13):**  And I would look at simple things like killing two birds with one stone.  
**[0:57:18-0:57:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:57:18):**  For instance, I've been thinking a lot about automobile pollution.  
**[0:57:23-0:57:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:57:23):**  We have roads.  
**[0:57:24-0:57:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:57:24):**  We're not going to stop using them anytime soon.  
**[0:57:26-0:57:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:57:26):**  Instead, what we're doing is building cars that use batteries, but we don't have a good  
**[0:57:32-0:57:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:57:32):**  system for disposing of batteries or recycling batteries right now.  
**[0:57:34-0:57:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:57:34):**  So they're also causing immense amount of problems, even though they are a solution  
**[0:57:38-0:57:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:57:38):**  for air pollution.  
**[0:57:40-0:57:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:57:40):**  But what about just planting greenery on the edge of every single road to absorb a lot  
**[0:57:46-0:57:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:57:46):**  of the pollution so that it doesn't get into our lungs, so that it doesn't get into our  
**[0:57:50-0:57:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:57:50):**  farms, because so many farms are on the roadside.  
**[0:57:53-0:57:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:57:53):**  And what is that doing with the diesel particulate matter in the air?  
**[0:57:56-0:57:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:57:56):**  It's getting on our food.  
**[0:57:57-0:57:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:57:57):**  That's not OK.  
**[0:57:58-0:57:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:57:58):**  It's getting into our soil.  
**[0:57:59-0:58:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:57:59):**  Also, one of the biggest plastic pollutions is tires as they drive on the road and disintegrate.  
**[0:58:05-0:58:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:58:05):**  And that's all going by the roadside.  
**[0:58:07-0:58:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:58:07):**  So we need a buffer on the side of every single road.  
**[0:58:10-0:58:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:58:10):**  And that should be a prioritization for municipalities.  
**[0:58:16-0:58:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:58:16):**  Get a buffer on every road legally and plant it with native species of plants, have it  
**[0:58:21-0:58:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:58:21):**  tended to by local communities, make it a community event.  
**[0:58:24-0:58:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:58:24):**  I think making everything we do into a community event can really increase the power of it.  
**[0:58:30-0:58:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:58:30):**  It's free marketing, but also it brings people together and makes people happier.  
**[0:58:37-0:58:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:58:37):**  And when you go to, I don't know if you go to, let's say agriecology or regenerative  
**[0:58:43-0:58:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:58:43):**  agriculture, even biodynamic, actually, when you go to biodynamic conferences, where are  
**[0:58:48-0:58:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:58:48):**  you contrarian?  
**[0:58:49-0:58:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:58:49):**  Where in your group, in your bubble, let's say, bubble is a bad word, in a positive sense,  
**[0:58:54-0:58:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:58:54):**  where do you think differently?  
**[0:58:55-0:58:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:58:55):**  And it's definitely a question inspired by John Kempf.  
**[0:58:58-0:59:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:58:58):**  Like, what do you believe to be true about biodynamic farming that others don't?  
**[0:59:03-0:59:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:59:03):**  And what do you others in your own scene, because I'm curious where you think differently.  
**[0:59:07-0:59:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:59:07):**  What's the way you stand out when you go to these kind of meetings?  
**[0:59:13-0:59:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:59:13):**  I found that I think of biodynamics at scale.  
**[0:59:17-0:59:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:59:17):**  I think of biodynamics covering all the terrestrial land that humans manage.  
**[0:59:22-0:59:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:59:22):**  And I think that the biodynamic movement hasn't been thinking so big like that.  
**[0:59:29-0:59:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:59:29):**  And I hope that that's going to happen.  
**[0:59:31-0:59:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:59:31):**  And I know there are many, I'm not saying I'm the only person thinking about that, and  
**[0:59:34-0:59:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:59:34):**  I'm not trying to toot my own horn at all.  
**[0:59:36-0:59:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:59:36):**  But I have received feedback from people in the biodynamic movement saying, oh, wow, I  
**[0:59:40-0:59:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:59:40):**  wasn't thinking of it as such a big scale solution.  
**[0:59:45-0:59:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:59:45):**  And so I'd like to run with that and keep going, because it is an incredible climate  
**[0:59:49-0:59:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:59:49):**  solution with so many opportunities.  
**[0:59:54-0:59:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:59:54):**  Why do you think that is?  
**[0:59:55-1:00:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=0:59:55):**  Why is there, hasn't been, I'm not saying you're the first one or the only one, like  
**[1:00:00-1:00:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:00:00):**  you mentioned, but few, let's say talking about, OK, how do we do a region, a country,  
**[1:00:06-1:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:00:06):**  an island, a bioregion landscape in these agroecology, life focused, holistic view,  
**[1:00:14-1:00:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:00:14):**  biodynamic farming?  
**[1:00:15-1:00:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:00:15):**  Like what has been holding back?  
**[1:00:17-1:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:00:17):**  I see it in region in general as well.  
**[1:00:19-1:00:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:00:19):**  Like it's very, we're very much focused on the farm level.  
**[1:00:21-1:00:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:00:21):**  And then sort of what happens beyond the farm gate is like, yeah, but if your whole landscape  
**[1:00:25-1:00:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:00:25):**  is moving backwards, it would be nice if it moves forward.  
**[1:00:27-1:00:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:00:27):**  It makes your life a lot easier because your neighbor isn't spraying like crazy or has  
**[1:00:32-1:00:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:00:32):**  been polluting the river.  
**[1:00:33-1:00:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:00:33):**  I mean, you are all in the same system.  
**[1:00:36-1:00:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:00:36):**  So I would imagine there's a lot of work going into landscape scale regeneration and there's  
**[1:00:41-1:00:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:00:41):**  surprisingly not so much happening there.  
**[1:00:43-1:00:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:00:43):**  What has been holding back the biodynamic movement to think at scale?  
**[1:00:47-1:00:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:00:47):**  Because it is, I mean, I will link below the interview we did with La Viala in Tuscany.  
**[1:00:52-1:00:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:00:52):**  It's more than a thousand, two hundred hectares under management, plus a lot more forestry.  
**[1:00:57-1:00:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:00:57):**  Like scale is definitely there.  
**[1:00:59-1:01:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:00:59):**  Maybe not so known, but it's there.  
**[1:01:00-1:01:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:01:00):**  Like what has been holding back the rest of the movement there to start thinking or dreaming  
**[1:01:05-1:01:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:01:05):**  maybe about scale?  
**[1:01:07-1:01:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:01:07):**  I wonder if it's because farmers are so busy.  
**[1:01:10-1:01:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:01:10):**  They're so busy managing the amount of work and the amount of land that they have.  
**[1:01:16-1:01:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:01:16):**  Maybe it takes non-farmers coming into this space and going, how can we think big?  
**[1:01:21-1:01:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:01:21):**  What can I do to help you expand?  
**[1:01:23-1:01:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:01:23):**  Which is the question that I ask every biodynamic farmer I meet.  
**[1:01:27-1:01:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:01:27):**  How can I support the amazing work that you're already doing so that this can become one  
**[1:01:32-1:01:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:01:32):**  of the most important climate solutions out there?  
**[1:01:36-1:01:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:01:36):**  And maybe it takes that.  
**[1:01:39-1:01:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:01:39):**  And to wrap up, I mean, I usually ask a final question and then it's never the final question,  
**[1:01:44-1:01:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:01:44):**  but what are you busy with these days?  
**[1:01:47-1:01:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:01:47):**  What are you excited about, let's say over the next month as we're going into summer  
**[1:01:50-1:01:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:01:50):**  2022?  
**[1:01:51-1:01:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:01:51):**  I'm not explaining obviously when you're listening to this, but we're talking spring, early spring,  
**[1:01:55-1:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:01:55):**  depending where you are, let's say spring 2022 on a Northern hemisphere, which I learned  
**[1:02:00-1:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:02:00):**  lately actually that according to indigenous peoples, usually the North was down and the  
**[1:02:04-1:02:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:02:04):**  South was up, which is very interesting from our perspective, but let's spark that for  
**[1:02:08-1:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:02:08):**  a second.  
**[1:02:09-1:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:02:09):**  What are you excited about for this summer in terms of your work on your activism on  
**[1:02:15-1:02:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:02:15):**  let's say the most radical stuff?  
**[1:02:16-1:02:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:02:16):**  What are we, what should we look out for from you and your team?  
**[1:02:21-1:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:02:21):**  In terms of what I'm learning about that I'm most excited is I've gotten into the Divine  
**[1:02:25-1:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:02:25):**  Feminine.  
**[1:02:26-1:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:02:26):**  I feel like that's the next step and it's the one after the domination stuff.  
**[1:02:31-1:02:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:02:31):**  It's incredible when you learn about the, well, I'll just leave it there.  
**[1:02:36-1:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:02:36):**  It's incredible.  
**[1:02:37-1:02:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:02:37):**  Go and look at the stuff, Mary Magdalene, Hildegard, all of these stories and legends  
**[1:02:43-1:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:02:43):**  and the way modern people are thinking about it now, academics as well as citizens, it's  
**[1:02:49-1:02:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:02:49):**  really adding a lot to the way I think.  
**[1:02:52-1:02:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:02:52):**  Then also I'm really excited about COP27, which is coming up in November and the preparation  
**[1:02:56-1:03:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:02:56):**  I'm doing for that with Dirt and other organizations, the Biodynamic Association in Egypt because  
**[1:03:02-1:03:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:03:02):**  COP27 is in Egypt and also other organizations that we may be partnering with to raise awareness  
**[1:03:08-1:03:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:03:08):**  about biodynamics.  
**[1:03:10-1:03:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:03:10):**  Excited about my consulting, helping more brands to businesses to transition.  
**[1:03:15-1:03:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:03:15):**  I'm also have been wanting to for ages and it looks like it's finally happening, getting  
**[1:03:20-1:03:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:03:20):**  into the investment world.  
**[1:03:22-1:03:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:03:22):**  I've been having my eye on so many businesses for the last seven years of my activism and  
**[1:03:29-1:03:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:03:29):**  watching them all become successful.  
**[1:03:31-1:03:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:03:31):**  The ones that I thought were going to become successful did and the ones that I thought,  
**[1:03:36-1:03:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:03:36):**  that's not really a good idea, didn't become successful.  
**[1:03:38-1:03:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:03:38):**  I'm honing in on how to choose businesses that are going to succeed and I'm really excited  
**[1:03:45-1:03:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:03:45):**  about becoming a bigger part of the investing space through conversations that I'm having  
**[1:03:49-1:03:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:03:49):**  that are too fledgling to talk about now, but really excited about how they will develop.  
**[1:03:57-1:04:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:03:57):**  I love the regenerative space and it turns out I have a relatively good barometer for  
**[1:04:02-1:04:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:04:02):**  what is going to work and what isn't.  
**[1:04:05-1:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:04:05):**  I think that's because I'm working as much as I can to take my ego out of it.  
**[1:04:10-1:04:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:04:10):**  This isn't about me.  
**[1:04:11-1:04:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:04:11):**  I'm doing this work because I love it.  
**[1:04:13-1:04:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:04:13):**  I'm enriched on a daily basis by the learning that I do on a daily basis to educate myself  
**[1:04:19-1:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:04:19):**  about the climate crisis, about the earth, about human behaviors, about all of these  
**[1:04:23-1:04:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:04:23):**  things that intertwine and interlock.  
**[1:04:27-1:04:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:04:27):**  I think I can see from a really clear point of view because of that.  
**[1:04:29-1:04:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:04:29):**  I'm not in it to win it in a way.  
**[1:04:32-1:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:04:32):**  I'm just in it to support because the win is already there every minute that I spend  
**[1:04:39-1:04:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:04:39):**  of my time doing this.  
**[1:04:42-1:04:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:04:42):**  Depending on the time, at the moment I don't pay myself at dirt and I work 45 to 55 hours  
**[1:04:46-1:04:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:04:46):**  a week on it.  
**[1:04:47-1:04:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:04:47):**  It's amazing to be able to do that.  
**[1:04:49-1:04:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:04:49):**  I feel so grateful and lucky that my modeling career is allowing me to do that.  
**[1:04:55-1:04:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:04:55):**  I understand that most people do not have that privilege and I don't take it lightly  
**[1:04:59-1:05:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:04:59):**  at all.  
**[1:05:00-1:05:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:05:00):**  It's amazing to participate in the gift economy like this, to be giving my time for an organization  
**[1:05:06-1:05:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:05:06):**  that really needs it because dirt is fledgling and it wouldn't be the same if it needed  
**[1:05:11-1:05:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:05:11):**  to pay a CEO right now, which at some point I will need to do that.  
**[1:05:16-1:05:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:05:16):**  I will replace some of what I'm doing or all of what I'm doing with somebody else who's  
**[1:05:19-1:05:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:05:19):**  probably going to be way more skilled than I am in some things.  
**[1:05:22-1:05:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:05:22):**  But at the moment it's necessary that I'm able to do this and I love it.  
**[1:05:27-1:05:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:05:27):**  I don't think there's a better one or a better way to end this conversation.  
**[1:05:32-1:05:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:05:32):**  We'll definitely follow up on a lot of this work on the investment side, on COP and all  
**[1:05:37-1:05:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:05:37):**  of that.  
**[1:05:38-1:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:05:38):**  I hope it's not the last time.  
**[1:05:40-1:05:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:05:40):**  We had you on the podcast and I want to definitely thank you so much for your work and for coming  
**[1:05:46-1:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:05:46):**  on here to share and to discuss about the funny parts, the potential, the huge opportunities,  
**[1:05:54-1:05:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:05:54):**  the barriers of biodynamic farming and actually fashion.  
**[1:05:58-1:05:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:05:58):**  We learned a lot I think in these episodes.  
**[1:05:59-1:06:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:05:59):**  We very rarely talk about fashion and fibers, which is such an enormous industry.  
**[1:06:05-1:06:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:06:05):**  We're sort of keeping the core.  
**[1:06:07-1:06:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:06:07):**  So thank you so much for what you're doing and for coming on here to share and hope to

**[1:06:21-1:06:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:06:21):**  It's so important, so important and interesting to listen to.

**[1:07:27-1:07:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:07:27):**  Dear friends of the podcast, I'm super excited to share with you the online video course  
**[1:07:53-1:07:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:07:53):**  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[1:07:57-1:08:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:07:57):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  
**[1:08:01-1:08:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:08:01):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[1:08:03-1:08:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:08:03):**  After 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question how to put money  
**[1:08:07-1:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:08:07):**  to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011 and recording  
**[1:08:12-1:08:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:08:12):**  these podcasts since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  
**[1:08:17-1:08:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:08:17):**  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  
**[1:08:19-1:08:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:08:19):**  How have we built our decision making framework, what to focus on with the podcast, how have  
**[1:08:24-1:08:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:08:24):**  we picked interviewees, what questions should you ask, what is happening in the space, what  
**[1:08:29-1:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:08:29):**  should you read, what should you listen, what should you watch, how to approach this space.  
**[1:08:36-1:08:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:08:36):**  For whom is this course?  
**[1:08:37-1:08:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:08:37):**  You, the soil builders and investors in the space.  
**[1:08:40-1:08:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:08:40):**  The soil builders, people working in this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers,  
**[1:08:45-1:08:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:08:45):**  vehicle builders, crowd investing, platform builders, ag tech companies, farm to gut food  
**[1:08:50-1:08:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:08:50):**  companies, permaculture, key line designers, holistic management, consultants, etc.  
**[1:08:54-1:08:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:08:54):**  People that are building soil at scale.  
**[1:08:57-1:09:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:08:57):**  And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office  
**[1:09:00-1:09:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:09:00):**  or as private individuals or people who are putting other people's money to work through  
**[1:09:04-1:09:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:09:04):**  foundations, institutional capital, banks, insurance companies, etc.  
**[1:09:09-1:09:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:09:09):**  Is this course free?  
**[1:09:10-1:09:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:09:10):**  No.  
**[1:09:11-1:09:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:09:11):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[1:09:14-1:09:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:09:14):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.  
**[1:09:18-1:09:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:09:18):**  And I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very  
**[1:09:22-1:09:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:09:22):**  different means.  
**[1:09:23-1:09:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:09:23):**  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[1:09:29-1:09:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:09:29):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[1:09:31-1:09:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:09:31):**  Thank you.  
**[1:09:32-1:09:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:09:32):**  So what is this course?  
**[1:09:34-1:09:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:09:34):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides.  
**[1:09:40-1:09:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:09:40):**  So you don't have to write along.  
**[1:09:42-1:09:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:09:42):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[1:09:47-1:09:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:09:47):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[1:09:52-1:09:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:09:52):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[1:09:57-1:09:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:09:57):**  if you're a soil builder.  
**[1:09:59-1:10:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:09:59):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[1:10:04-1:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:10:04):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[1:10:07-1:10:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:10:07):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[1:10:12-1:10:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:10:12):**  So what is it not?  
**[1:10:13-1:10:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:10:13):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[1:10:15-1:10:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:10:15):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[1:10:18-1:10:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:10:18):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[1:10:21-1:10:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:10:21):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[1:10:23-1:10:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:10:23):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.  
**[1:10:28-1:10:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:10:28):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking.  
**[1:10:32-1:10:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/arizona-muse#t=1:10:32):**  Click on the link below, sign up and I'm really looking forward to your feedback.

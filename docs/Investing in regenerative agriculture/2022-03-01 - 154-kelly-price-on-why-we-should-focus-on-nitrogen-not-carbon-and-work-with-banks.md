### Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food  (Tue, 01 Mar 2022 17:00:00)
## 154 Kelly Price on why we should focus on nitrogen not carbon and work with banks  
**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?

**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:00:14):**  Nitrogen and chemical fertilizer.  
**[0:00:15-0:00:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:00:15):**  We don't talk about it a lot, but with energy prices at record levels in Europe and thus  
**[0:00:20-0:00:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:00:20):**  the price of chemical fertilizer is directly tied to fossil fuel gas or quote unquote natural  
**[0:00:25-0:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:00:25):**  gas.  
**[0:00:26-0:00:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:00:26):**  This means record prices for fertilizer.  
**[0:00:28-0:00:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:00:28):**  Last year plus 300% that is a three with two zeros.  
**[0:00:32-0:00:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:00:32):**  As it is an extremely potent greenhouse gas as well, we need to work with farmers to implement  
**[0:00:37-0:00:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:00:37):**  regenerative practices and reduce our reliance on chemical fertilizer.  
**[0:00:41-0:00:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:00:41):**  Our guest of today argues that we can do this by working through the banks.  
**[0:00:47-0:00:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:00:47):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture investing as if the  
**[0:00:52-0:00:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:00:52):**  planet mattered.  
**[0:00:53-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:00:53):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:58-0:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:00:58):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:01:03-0:01:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:01:03):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:01:07):**  Why my focus on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:10-0:01:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:01:10):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:13-0:01:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:01:13):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:01:16):**  And it's time that we as investors big and small and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:21-0:01:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:01:21):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:25-0:01:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:01:25):**  In March last year we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support

**[0:01:50-0:01:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:01:50):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:01:52):**  Welcome to another episode today with the CEO of Agreed, helping farmers to profit naturally.  
**[0:01:57-0:01:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:01:57):**  Welcome Kelly.  
**[0:01:58-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:01:58):**  Hi, thanks for having me.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:02:00):**  And we always start with this.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:02:01):**  I mean, you're a listener of the podcast.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:02:03):**  We start with this personal question.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:02:04):**  How did you end up working on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:02:07-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:02:07):**  Yeah, it's a great question.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:02:09):**  I was a biologist by training and then had a career consulting in the pharmaceutical  
**[0:02:14-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:02:14):**  industry, but I increasingly became concerned about the planet's health as opposed to humans  
**[0:02:19-0:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:02:19):**  health and I really wanted to transition and use my background to focus on entrepreneurship  
**[0:02:26-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:02:26):**  that would help the climate crisis.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:02:30):**  And as a biologist, I know that soil is the foundation of everything.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:02:34):**  The only energy that we're harnessing on the planet for the most part is coming from plants,  
**[0:02:38-0:02:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:02:38):**  which depend on soil.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:02:40):**  So if we don't have soil health, we're not harnessing that energy and we won't be able  
**[0:02:44-0:02:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:02:44):**  to feed ourselves.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:02:45):**  So that's how I came to it.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:02:46):**  And as a biologist, you mentioned, we know that soil is the foundation.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:02:51):**  I don't know if all biologists, I mean, they should know, but they maybe don't.  
**[0:02:56-0:02:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:02:56):**  Do you remember when that realization came?  
**[0:02:59-0:03:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:02:59):**  Like, okay, it all starts with soil or oceans, obviously, depending on what we're eating.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:03:03):**  But do you remember when that realization came and how was it a smaller process?  
**[0:03:08-0:03:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:03:08):**  Was it a book?  
**[0:03:09-0:03:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:03:09):**  Was it a movie?  
**[0:03:10-0:03:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:03:10):**  Was it a tomato you ate straight from the plant?  
**[0:03:13-0:03:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:03:13):**  What was that trigger?  
**[0:03:14-0:03:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:03:14):**  Yeah, well, you know, it's funny.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:03:15):**  It definitely wasn't from my biology courses, which, you know, I thought, wow, I'm a bit  
**[0:03:20-0:03:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:03:20):**  late to the party here to be figuring this out well after university.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:03:25):**  But it was reading Gabe Brown's book Dirt to Soil that really brought that light bulb  
**[0:03:30-0:03:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:03:30):**  moment to me because that's when I had that aha of, oh, yeah, the soil is alive.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:03:37):**  It's a living organism.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:03:39):**  It's an ecosystem.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:03:40):**  And that's what feeds the plants.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:03:43):**  That plus sunlight.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:03:44):**  And if we only have one half of that equation, we're not going to have healthy plants.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:03:49):**  And that was that epiphany for me.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:03:50):**  And if we don't have healthy plants, we can't have healthy humans because we can't feed  
**[0:03:55-0:03:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:03:55):**  ourselves.  
**[0:03:56-0:03:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:03:56):**  And I mean, I think many people be nodding now.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:03:59):**  I say, okay, Gabe Brown, of course, I read the book as well.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:04:01):**  It's super interesting.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:04:02):**  But it's quite a niche book.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:04:03):**  Like, you don't pick that up on an airport normally.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:04:06):**  Like, how did that come to you?  
**[0:04:07-0:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:04:07):**  How did somebody say you should really read this Dirt to Soil?  
**[0:04:10-0:04:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:04:10):**  Like, what was the trigger to open that or to get that book or open a book of quite a  
**[0:04:15-0:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:04:15):**  niche subject of a farmer in the US?  
**[0:04:18-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:04:18):**  Yeah, well, this is kind of how did I come to focus on regenerative agriculture, which  
**[0:04:23-0:04:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:04:23):**  is a whole other story.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:04:24):**  But just to answer your question quickly, we have time.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:04:27):**  We do have time.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:04:28):**  It was watching the film Kiss the Ground, which he features in.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:04:33):**  And that's what really got me understanding.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:04:36):**  You know, I knew that there were problems with the food system from some previous work  
**[0:04:39-0:04:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:04:39):**  I'd done in food waste.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:04:41):**  But it was watching Kiss the Ground and understanding how we're killing the soil with the way we're  
**[0:04:46-0:04:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:04:46):**  currently growing things that helped me get on this mental journey.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:04:51):**  And then, of course, I picked up Gabe's book.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:04:53):**  And I actually got to speak to Gabe a while back.  
**[0:04:55-0:04:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:04:55):**  Wow.  
**[0:04:56-0:04:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:04:56):**  And that was, yeah, that was a really great moment.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:04:58):**  He honestly salted the earth.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:05:01):**  Genuinely nice guy.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:05:02):**  He took a call from me while he was just sitting at DFW Airport waiting for a flight.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:05:07):**  He's that nice.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:05:08):**  Wow.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:05:09):**  And then I've seen him speak virtually.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:05:12):**  And that's the closest we got.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:05:13):**  But that was already fascinating.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:05:16):**  Shout out to Jan Giesbert who might be listening, who's very close to Gabe as well.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:05:21):**  I think it was at a small gathering we organized close to Berlin where he spoke virtually because  
**[0:05:27-0:05:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:05:27):**  it was still COVID times.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:05:29):**  So it's now, but he comes through even through a scream.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:05:31):**  He comes through very, very warm and incredibly engaged in this topic.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:05:36):**  So that's okay, that starts to make sense.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:05:39):**  You see somebody like the entry point of a documentary.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:05:41):**  I think they had an impact with that documentary, which has been quite astonishing.  
**[0:05:45-0:05:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:05:45):**  And then picking up a book and going deeper.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:05:47):**  And then you decided to found a company or to start working, like putting your working  
**[0:05:52-0:05:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:05:52):**  energy and working hours and not just your thinking hours and maybe after work on this  
**[0:05:57-0:05:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:05:57):**  problem.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:05:58):**  What was the first step you took there?  
**[0:06:00-0:06:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:06:00):**  Yeah.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:06:01):**  Well, I've always found in my career that I'm best when I'm able to funnel a passion.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:06:06):**  And in my previous career in pharmaceuticals that was helping cancer patients and I really,  
**[0:06:10-0:06:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:06:10):**  really enjoyed that.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:06:11):**  But as I said, when I became more concerned about the planet, I wanted to pivot to entrepreneurship  
**[0:06:17-0:06:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:06:17):**  that would help the climate crisis.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:06:20):**  And of course, with a background in biology, I was drawn to things in that area.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:06:25):**  And I had worked briefly at various climate tech startups working in the food space.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:06:31):**  One was a company called Winnow that was helping to reduce food waste using AI and computer  
**[0:06:36-0:06:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:06:36):**  vision, which was a great experience and helped me understand how much waste we have in the  
**[0:06:41-0:06:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:06:41):**  system, which is just really terrible.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:06:44):**  Yeah.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:06:45):**  When you see it, I mean, you're saying with visuals, it's when you see the food waste  
**[0:06:48-0:06:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:06:48):**  is very different when you hear 30, 40%.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:06:50):**  We're like, oh, 30, 40%.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:06:52):**  That's like massive.  
**[0:06:54-0:06:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:06:54):**  But when you see like how much, and I think this company is mostly based on restaurants  
**[0:06:59-0:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:06:59):**  or the, and they like, it's just the sheer quantity through imagery is you cannot see  
**[0:07:05-0:07:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:07:05):**  it.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:07:06):**  But Kelly's closing her eyes and remembering the sheer quantity of the mountains of food  
**[0:07:09-0:07:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:07:09):**  waste.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:07:10):**  Yeah.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:07:11):**  Now that triggers something.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:07:12):**  Yeah.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:07:13):**  And just a little bit about that, you know, there's the amount that we're wasting.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:07:15):**  And then when you think about all of the energy and chemical inputs that went into growing  
**[0:07:21-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:07:21):**  that food and transporting that food, and then you think about how that food, if thrown  
**[0:07:26-0:07:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:07:26):**  into a landfill, but turns into methane, which is 30 times more potent than CO2 as a greenhouse  
**[0:07:31-0:07:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:07:31):**  gas, then you just really, your jaw starts dropping, doesn't it?  
**[0:07:35-0:07:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:07:35):**  All that waste, it's mind boggling.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:07:38):**  And still, I mean, you're working with cancer patients and you're working in food waste.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:07:41):**  These are big, hairy problems to talk, you can work your full career in that, but you  
**[0:07:46-0:07:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:07:46):**  decided to start focusing on soil and farmers and the transition to more regenerative practices  
**[0:07:53-0:07:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:07:53):**  or practices that have a regenerative outcome.  
**[0:07:55-0:07:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:07:55):**  What led you down that path?  
**[0:07:57-0:08:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:07:57):**  What led you to, because with Winnow, you could probably work for the next 20, 30 years.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:08:02):**  There's no issue there whatsoever.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:08:04):**  Like food waste is going to be there for a while, unfortunately.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:08:06):**  Yeah, you're exactly right.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:08:07):**  It is a big, hairy problem.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:08:09):**  And in fact, that's what they call it in Winnow.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:08:11):**  And I think, you know, work can be stressful no matter what you're doing.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:08:16):**  And I think that I found that if I'm working on something I really care about, it's not  
**[0:08:19-0:08:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:08:19):**  stressful because it's good kind of stress, right?  
**[0:08:22-0:08:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:08:22):**  You don't mind working hard when you know it's something that's really important to  
**[0:08:25-0:08:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:08:25):**  me really care about.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:08:27):**  And so as I got more into the problem of food waste and the food system, I started understanding  
**[0:08:34-0:08:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:08:34):**  about the problems we face in the production side of things.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:08:37):**  I thought about all that energy that was going into growing it and that was then wasted.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:08:42):**  And that, and I worked with a company called Trident Supply, which is trying to get sustainable  
**[0:08:46-0:08:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:08:46):**  growers matched with restaurants here in the UK.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:08:49):**  And I learned more about the supply chain side of it and how difficult it is to source  
**[0:08:53-0:08:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:08:53):**  sustainable produce.  
**[0:08:55-0:08:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:08:55):**  And so that further informed it.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:08:57):**  And then I had a little detour working for a clean fintech company, which further informed  
**[0:09:04-0:09:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:09:04):**  that the solution we came to agreed.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:09:06):**  But that company was basically trying to help create investment vehicles for decarbonization  
**[0:09:13-0:09:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:09:13):**  tools because right now, if you want to put your money in a good way, like an ESG fund,  
**[0:09:19-0:09:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:09:19):**  there's myriad funds out there to choose from.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:09:22):**  If you peel back the wrapper, you find that most of the companies in that fund are the  
**[0:09:26-0:09:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:09:26):**  same ones, the usual suspects.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:09:28):**  They're banks, financial services and tech companies like Google because they have a  
**[0:09:33-0:09:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:09:33):**  lower carbon footprint.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:09:35):**  They're doing less harm.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:09:37):**  Directly, yeah.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:09:39):**  The scope one and two is a lot lower.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:09:41):**  It's the easy ones, yeah.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:09:42):**  But nobody's tackling the difficult ones.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:09:44):**  Exactly, exactly.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:09:46):**  Nobody's tackling the real source of the problem and coming up with solutions.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:09:50):**  And so I wanted to create something that was actually becoming one of those solutions to  
**[0:09:54-0:09:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:09:54):**  help draw down carbon and really help fix the system itself rather than just do less  
**[0:09:58-0:09:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:09:58):**  bad.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:09:59):**  So that was the thinking behind it.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:10:01):**  The actual impetus was I did a program through Cambridge and their Sustainability Leadership  
**[0:10:08-0:10:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:10:08):**  Institute on sustainable business.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:10:11):**  And I learned about this program called Carbon13.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:10:13):**  It was a new venture builder for the climate crisis that they were creating.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:10:18):**  And they were going to create companies to draw down carbon.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:10:22):**  And I thought, this is it.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:10:23):**  I worked for and with startups.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:10:26):**  I want to start my own.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:10:28):**  And it was a vehicle to meet like-minded founders who are also passionate about the climate  
**[0:10:32-0:10:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:10:32):**  crisis and using entrepreneurship to solve it.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:10:36):**  And so I joined that program.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:10:37):**  It was last, I think, middle of March, and we were the first cohort.  
**[0:10:43-0:10:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:10:43):**  And it was very interesting and exciting because we started during COVID, during lockdown here  
**[0:10:48-0:10:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:10:48):**  in the UK.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:10:49):**  So we had to meet people on Zoom and do everything by Zoom.  
**[0:10:55-0:11:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:10:55):**  And the program, you could kind of liken it to Love Island meets Dragon's Den because  
**[0:11:01-0:11:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:11:01):**  it took from 600 applicants, 60 individuals.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:11:05):**  And then we were supposed to meet each other and team.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:11:08):**  And then those teams had to come up with business ideas that would draw down 10 million tons  
**[0:11:13-0:11:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:11:13):**  of CO2 with their business practices and then work on those ideas and then pitch to the  
**[0:11:19-0:11:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:11:19):**  dragons at the end for funding.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:11:22):**  And so during the teaming, it was meeting people on Zoom, kind of like trying to decide  
**[0:11:26-0:11:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:11:26):**  to financially marry somebody when you've never actually met in real life, which is  
**[0:11:31-0:11:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:11:31):**  interesting.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:11:32):**  Sounds tricky.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:11:33):**  Yeah, definitely.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:11:35):**  And then teams formed and then there was intrigue and teams broke up and you're like, is this  
**[0:11:39-0:11:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:11:39):**  person with this team or that team?  
**[0:11:41-0:11:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:11:41):**  We don't know what's going on.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:11:43):**  So that was kind of the Love Island excitement of it.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:11:47):**  And then 23 teams eventually formed and pitched for funding and eight went on to receive that  
**[0:11:53-0:11:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:11:53):**  funding and we were one of the eight.  
**[0:11:55-0:11:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:11:55):**  And so it was a really great adventure.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:11:58):**  This is a dangerous question to ask because things in Startup Live, as you said, we're  
**[0:12:01-0:12:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:12:01):**  recording this actually in February 2022 and you started in March 21.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:12:06):**  So we're even less than a year in.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:12:08):**  And I've followed this since November last year, so for like three months, four months.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:12:13):**  And it's already, I wouldn't say changed dramatically, but changed over time and morphed into something  
**[0:12:18-0:12:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:12:18):**  else.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:12:19):**  And so I'm going to ask a dangerous question, which might be irrelevant when we put this  
**[0:12:22-0:12:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:12:22):**  out.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:12:23):**  But if you're listening to this in three years, it might be a bit different.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:12:25):**  But what is agreed at the moment?  
**[0:12:27-0:12:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:12:27):**  Like what are you if you had to, I mean, you're doing your fundraising, so you're doing this  
**[0:12:30-0:12:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:12:30):**  elevator pitch 6,000 times probably.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:12:33):**  If you had to explain agreed in a few sentences and we have more than a few sentences because  
**[0:12:37-0:12:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:12:37):**  I will be asking follow up questions.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:12:38):**  But what would you what would you say you are at the moment?  
**[0:12:41-0:12:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:12:41):**  We're in February 2022.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:12:43):**  I love that.  
**[0:12:44-0:12:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:12:44):**  And I always ask the question back for the elevator pitch.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:12:46):**  Well how tall is the building?  
**[0:12:48-0:12:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:12:48):**  Very tall.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:12:49):**  We're in London.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:12:50):**  It's like we have a few minutes.  
**[0:12:51-0:12:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:12:51):**  Is it the Shard?  
**[0:12:52-0:12:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:12:52):**  Are we in the Shard?  
**[0:12:53-0:12:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:12:53):**  Yeah, it's definitely.  
**[0:12:54-0:12:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:12:54):**  Great.  
**[0:12:55-0:12:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:12:55):**  And the answer is very simple.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:12:59):**  We're mission focused and our mission is to accelerate the transition to regenerative  
**[0:13:04-0:13:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:13:04):**  agriculture.  
**[0:13:05-0:13:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:13:05):**  And so as long as we keep our eyes on the prize and we're in love with the problem,  
**[0:13:09-0:13:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:13:09):**  the solution follows.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:13:11):**  We're not focused on a solution that we're trying to shoehorn into a particular problem.  
**[0:13:16-0:13:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:13:16):**  And so that's why it's evolved over time because as we focus on this problem, we understand  
**[0:13:21-0:13:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:13:21):**  more and more about what would actually move the needle.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:13:24):**  And so just kind of taking a step back, my team, there's three of us, myself, my co-founder  
**[0:13:30-0:13:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:13:30):**  Sarah who comes from a farming background and has an expertise in behavior science.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:13:36):**  Always nice to have somebody with a farming background on the team.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:13:39):**  And always like the technical decks I get and I'm scrolling very quickly to the team  
**[0:13:43-0:13:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:13:43):**  page and think, okay, none of them has visited a farm recently.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:13:48):**  It's tricky.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:13:49):**  But I think Robin O'Brien of Replant Capital says, yeah, we'll just delete the deck.  
**[0:13:53-0:13:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:13:53):**  Maybe she didn't say that, but she definitely said the amount of technology companies I  
**[0:13:56-0:14:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:13:56):**  see in Silicon Valley that have not visited a farm recently at all raised an insane amount  
**[0:14:02-0:14:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:14:02):**  of money, burned most of it because yeah, they were searching for a problem with the  
**[0:14:06-0:14:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:14:06):**  tool they had, with the solution they had.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:14:08):**  So okay, sorry, go ahead.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:14:10):**  But anyway, your co-founder has a very concrete farming background, which is great.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:14:13):**  Oh yeah, no, it's great because she keeps us real.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:14:16):**  You know, my co-founder Reed who comes from a tech background and I'll say something,  
**[0:14:20-0:14:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:14:20):**  she's like, do you know what a farmer would say to that?  
**[0:14:23-0:14:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:14:23):**  She's great.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:14:24):**  Yeah.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:14:25):**  We, you're a laptop farmers.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:14:26):**  Yeah, me too.  
**[0:14:27-0:14:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:14:27):**  Yeah, completely.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:14:28):**  I'm Farmville basically compared to her, you know, Excel spreadsheet farmers.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:14:33):**  Yeah.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:14:34):**  Spreadsheet farmer compared to her muddy boots.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:14:35):**  So it's really great to have that perspective.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:14:38):**  And like I said, she keeps it real and she helps us understand the farmer mindset so  
**[0:14:42-0:14:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:14:42):**  that we're starting where they are as opposed to trying to run to catch them and make them  
**[0:14:48-0:14:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:14:48):**  see things our way.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:14:49):**  And then my co-founder Reed comes from engineering tech background.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:14:53):**  He commercialized weather data, satellite weather data for NASA and then had a lovely  
**[0:14:59-0:15:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:14:59):**  career pivot as many of us do and founded his own craft rum distillery, as he likes  
**[0:15:06-0:15:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:15:06):**  to say his fun fact is he's an international award winning rum distiller.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:15:10):**  But that's where he learned about the sustainability issues and sourcing through the supply chain  
**[0:15:14-0:15:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:15:14):**  and really got interested in agriculture.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:15:16):**  So the three of us came from different directions but coalesced on this passion for agriculture,  
**[0:15:24-0:15:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:15:24):**  not only because it's such a source of emissions around one fourth of the world's greenhouse  
**[0:15:29-0:15:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:15:29):**  gases, but because it's such a solution, a potential sink with so many co-benefits and  
**[0:15:35-0:15:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:15:35):**  a way we probably still want to keep eating.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:15:38):**  And if we do, we need to change things.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:15:41):**  So that's why we focused on this mission and we're very passionate about helping farmers  
**[0:15:46-0:15:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:15:46):**  because as we see it, farmers are stuck in a system.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:15:49):**  They really, it's hard to get out of.  
**[0:15:52-0:16:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:15:52):**  They have been conditioned by the markets, by the CPGs, by us, by the companies chasing  
**[0:16:00-0:16:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:16:00):**  cheap food products and everything to chase yield almost at all costs.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:16:07):**  And I mean financial costs and I mean environmental cost.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:16:11):**  And mental costs, social costs as well.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:16:13):**  If we look at the countryside everywhere around the world, just picking on the UK, it's not  
**[0:16:18-0:16:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:16:18):**  going amazingly.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:16:19):**  No, no, no.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:16:21):**  They're literally being run into the ground.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:16:23):**  Sorry, there's so many puns that one can do in ag.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:16:26):**  It's a little dangerous, but they are by the system and the system needs to change and  
**[0:16:33-0:16:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:16:33):**  that's difficult.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:16:34):**  System change is very difficult.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:16:36):**  So in systems change, you want to look at that the easiest off-ramp you can possibly,  
**[0:16:41-0:16:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:16:41):**  even not ramp, it should be a tiny off-road that is very easy to take.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:16:45):**  I mean, a friend of the show, Jeroen Krompoh, likes to say, it's a very Dutch analogy, but  
**[0:16:50-0:16:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:16:50):**  you're sort of stuck with your bicycle in a tram track.  
**[0:16:53-0:16:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:16:53):**  If you've never been on a bicycle in a tram city, you don't know what I mean, but you  
**[0:16:56-0:17:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:16:56):**  can imagine if you're stuck with your little wheel in that tram track, you're going to  
**[0:17:00-0:17:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:17:00):**  follow the tram because if you move left or right, if you try to steer, if you even try  
**[0:17:04-0:17:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:17:04):**  to have some kind of agency, you'll fall over.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:17:07):**  So that's where most farmers are because of all of us and not because we want them  
**[0:17:13-0:17:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:17:13):**  to be there or they want to be there, but because they ended up there.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:17:16):**  So the question is how do we get the wheel out of the tram track in the least disruptive,  
**[0:17:21-0:17:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:17:21):**  painful revolution way?  
**[0:17:23-0:17:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:17:23):**  Because that's probably not what we want.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:17:24):**  No, no, exactly.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:17:26):**  The last thing we want is a whole bunch of our farmers who are some of the best stewards  
**[0:17:30-0:17:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:17:30):**  of the land to then go out of business and maybe have to sell their land to developers  
**[0:17:35-0:17:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:17:35):**  who will just build a bunch of flats or whatever.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:17:38):**  So we really want to help them stay in business sustainably, both financially and ecologically.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:17:45):**  And we did all kinds of background research when we decided to tackle this problem and  
**[0:17:50-0:17:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:17:50):**  accelerate the transition to Regen Ag.  
**[0:17:53-0:17:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:17:53):**  We attended Groundswell here in the UK, which is this wonderful event.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:17:57):**  I kind of liken it to the Glastonbury or for American listeners, Lollapalooza of Regen  
**[0:18:03-0:18:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:18:03):**  Ag, just this massive festival, so feel good, wonderful community there.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:18:08):**  And we talked to so many farmers and really started understanding the issues that they  
**[0:18:11-0:18:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:18:11):**  faced, what drove them to transition to Regen, the impetus that they had and what that journey  
**[0:18:17-0:18:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:18:17):**  was like for them.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:18:18):**  And that really helped inform our thinking.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:18:20):**  But something, you know, Kun, you were talking about how much we've evolved since you last  
**[0:18:25-0:18:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:18:25):**  spoke to us in November.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:18:27):**  When we first started working on this problem, we understood that there were two main barriers  
**[0:18:32-0:18:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:18:32):**  that farmers faced to even thinking about becoming regenerative.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:18:37):**  And one was an informational barrier challenge.  
**[0:18:41-0:18:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:18:41):**  They didn't know what to do on their specific land and their fields because they might see  
**[0:18:47-0:18:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:18:47):**  their neighbour doing something different, regenerative, but they would say, well, my  
**[0:18:51-0:18:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:18:51):**  fields are different, my operation is different, my land is different.  
**[0:18:55-0:19:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:18:55):**  Which is true because it's, as we know, extremely context specific.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:19:00):**  Two hundred percent.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:19:02):**  That's exactly it.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:19:03):**  It's so context specific that you can't take a cookie cutter formula and just plunk it  
**[0:19:08-0:19:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:19:08):**  down on another farm and expect it to work.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:19:11):**  So that's very challenging right there.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:19:12):**  It needs to be a very customised and adaptive approach as you go.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:19:16):**  Regen is a journey, not a destination.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:19:19):**  And one of the things I love about it is they're always looking to improve.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:19:23):**  I think Regen farmers are some of the best scientists on the planet.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:19:27):**  The way they're always reacting to what happens and trying to find something new and better  
**[0:19:30-0:19:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:19:30):**  that works.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:19:32):**  So that is a challenge if you're used to doing things in a more cookie cutter conventional  
**[0:19:38-0:19:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:19:38):**  way to all of a sudden have to completely adapt what you're doing.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:19:43):**  But the other thing was of course finance because as Joe Stanley says in his wonderful  
**[0:19:49-0:19:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:19:49):**  book Farm to Fork, it's hard to be green when your finances are in the red.  
**[0:19:55-0:20:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:19:55):**  And you and I just talked about how difficult these farmers are finding it, how the system  
**[0:20:01-0:20:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:20:01):**  isn't working brilliantly.  
**[0:20:03-0:20:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:20:03):**  In the UK because of Brexit the farmers here are losing the subsidies that they had been  
**[0:20:08-0:20:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:20:08):**  receiving from the EU.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:20:11):**  And farming hasn't been just the most profitable thing in the world to begin with, with the  
**[0:20:16-0:20:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:20:16):**  low food prices and how much the grocery stores are willing to pay for produce and things  
**[0:20:20-0:20:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:20:20):**  like that.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:20:22):**  A lot of the farms here had been relying fairly heavily to even depending upon these subsidies,  
**[0:20:29-0:20:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:20:29):**  just almost like insurance in case they had a bad year with the crop or things like that.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:20:34):**  And so with that going away that makes it all the harder for them to think about doing  
**[0:20:39-0:20:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:20:39):**  something new that might be risky.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:20:42):**  There's a lot of tension or stress in the market now as the new system is coming into  
**[0:20:47-0:20:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:20:47):**  place.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:20:48):**  It's not very clear yet if I, I mean we can spend hours on this alone.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:20:51):**  It's a very interesting opportunity.  
**[0:20:52-0:20:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:20:52):**  I think everybody in this space globally is watching because it's the sort of forced reset  
**[0:20:58-0:21:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:20:58):**  of a subsidy system and there at least is a lot of intention to move into more like  
**[0:21:03-0:21:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:21:03):**  say outcome based schemes and not just very simply pay because you have land for whatever  
**[0:21:09-0:21:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:21:09):**  reason whenever you took it, stole it, bought it, etc. or inherited it.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:21:14):**  And so that it's a very interesting experiment.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:21:16):**  But of course if you're right in it and you are dependent, like say most of your profit  
**[0:21:21-0:21:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:21:21):**  comes from or your living income comes from subsidies that are disappearing almost overnight,  
**[0:21:27-0:21:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:21:27):**  it's very stressful.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:21:28):**  And then you are adding the input crisis we have at the moment.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:21:31):**  We're living in a time where input costs went through the roof and yet I can imagine  
**[0:21:35-0:21:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:21:35):**  creates a lot of stress in not the right places.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:21:40):**  That's exactly it.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:21:42):**  You mentioned the environmental land management scheme ELMS and this is very, very true.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:21:46):**  So an outcome based environmentally focused scheme to help replace this subsidy that to  
**[0:21:52-0:21:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:21:52):**  be honest farmers kind of received just for the fact that they farmed land.  
**[0:21:58-0:22:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:21:58):**  There is kind of no strings attached money.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:22:00):**  For the most part it went to the bottom line which was very helpful for farmers and is  
**[0:22:06-0:22:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:22:06):**  one of the reasons that a robust crop insurance system hasn't really developed here in the  
**[0:22:10-0:22:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:22:10):**  UK.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:22:12):**  And so with the loss of that they're losing that buffer that what functioned as insurance  
**[0:22:16-0:22:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:22:16):**  and the land management scheme that may be coming in that as you said is more outcomes  
**[0:22:20-0:22:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:22:20):**  based.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:22:21):**  There's a few issues with it.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:22:23):**  Nobody knows exactly how it's going to play out.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:22:25):**  That's issue number one.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:22:26):**  As an entrepreneur that's difficult to plan for if you're running your farm obviously  
**[0:22:31-0:22:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:22:31):**  as a company.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:22:32):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:22:34):**  I think that the National Farmers Union, the NFU here is having a conference next week  
**[0:22:39-0:22:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:22:39):**  and one of their talks is like is uncertainty the new business norm or something like that.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:22:44):**  So yes it's very hard to plan.  
**[0:22:46-0:22:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:22:46):**  And I can tell you it is and it will be because nobody's going to be super happy with 100%  
**[0:22:50-0:22:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:22:50):**  happy with all of these but it's coming like there's massive changes coming.  
**[0:22:54-0:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:22:54):**  Oh, the one thing is certain is change.  
**[0:22:56-0:22:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:22:56):**  Yeah, the one thing is certain is this.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:22:58):**  So how does that you're saying we want to help create this offer and we want to help  
**[0:23:02-0:23:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:23:02):**  farmers transition.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:23:04):**  What's the entry point?  
**[0:23:05-0:23:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:23:05):**  What's the least, I wouldn't say easiest because none of this is easy, but what's the first  
**[0:23:09-0:23:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:23:09):**  step or the first entry point for a new company like agreed?  
**[0:23:13-0:23:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:23:13):**  It's not that you're you've been around for a long time.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:23:15):**  You have a stable business somewhere else and you're going to do also some new things.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:23:18):**  Now this is the main business.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:23:20):**  What did you decide as the focal point?  
**[0:23:22-0:23:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:23:22):**  Like is that the knife edge?  
**[0:23:23-0:23:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:23:23):**  There are many other facets obviously, but the point of the knife to enter this and to  
**[0:23:27-0:23:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:23:27):**  meet the farmers where they are aware and then help them where they want to go.  
**[0:23:31-0:23:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:23:31):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:23:32):**  Well, if you think like a farmer and you're losing this subsidy that was kind of your  
**[0:23:36-0:23:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:23:36):**  insurance buffer and your input costs arising at the same time, it's basically a perfect  
**[0:23:41-0:23:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:23:41):**  financial storm that farmers are facing here.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:23:44):**  And we realized that nitrogen actually was the key to everything.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:23:51):**  It was the starting point of the journey because the price of nitrogen fertilizer last year  
**[0:23:57-0:24:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:23:57):**  alone rose about 300% which is just huge.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:24:02):**  Three and two zeros, listeners, three and two zeros, that's three times.  
**[0:24:05-0:24:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:24:05):**  So imagine your main input costs, one of the main input costs overnight went 3x.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:24:10):**  Okay, that's significant.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:24:12):**  Exactly, 3x and that's the thing that kind of ensures you get that yield that you are  
**[0:24:18-0:24:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:24:18):**  incentivized to chase.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:24:20):**  And so that was huge to say the least.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:24:26):**  And we realized that nitrogen is the key because first of all, it is one of the biggest sources  
**[0:24:34-0:24:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:24:34):**  of the carbon footprint of a farm.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:24:38):**  I think a lot of people are focused on carbon and rightfully so, but in some ways this is  
**[0:24:43-0:24:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:24:43):**  almost like an etymological problem because actually what we're focused on is greenhouse  
**[0:24:48-0:24:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:24:48):**  gases and warming.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:24:50):**  And if you think about that, nitrogen is one of the biggest causes of greenhouse gases  
**[0:24:56-0:25:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:24:56):**  in farming because of the Haber-Bosch process that's used to produce it with methane which  
**[0:25:02-0:25:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:25:02):**  consumes about 2% of the world's energy which is just mind-boggling when you think about  
**[0:25:08-0:25:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:25:08):**  it.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:25:09):**  And then you spend all that energy and fossil fuels to create this nitrogen fertilizer.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:25:15):**  When you put it on the fields, you have the other 50% of the emissions which is actually  
**[0:25:20-0:25:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:25:20):**  in the form of nitrous oxide which is a potent greenhouse gas, 300 times more potent than  
**[0:25:27-0:25:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:25:27):**  CO2 that is released in the fields.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:25:31):**  Nitrous oxide is actually a component of smog as well so you've got an air pollution factor.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:25:35):**  So it's just this huge carbon footprint all just to grow our food.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:25:41):**  Carbon equivalent, that's I think the important part here.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:25:43):**  So we just do some of this and then we get to the part that doesn't even get its effect  
**[0:25:49-0:25:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:25:49):**  basically because most of it is wasted.  
**[0:25:51-0:25:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:25:51):**  But just to understand this is a greenhouse gas that we say always carbon equivalent,  
**[0:25:55-0:25:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:25:55):**  we should always say carbon dioxide equivalent or greenhouse gases as there are many different  
**[0:25:59-0:26:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:25:59):**  ones.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:26:00):**  This is one that's 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide or CO2 and it's created with  
**[0:26:04-0:26:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:26:04):**  a lot of energy which I know people are working on.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:26:07):**  But let's say the fertilizer issue on just the production side and then you write it  
**[0:26:12-0:26:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:26:12):**  on your land or you spread it and most of it doesn't end up on a plant.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:26:16):**  Most of it is being like the oxide comes off which creates huge amounts of smoke.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:26:20):**  And so it's a massively wasteful stuff which by any means has created a lot of benefits  
**[0:26:27-0:26:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:26:27):**  as well, a lot of cheap calories we've been producing over the last more or less a century,  
**[0:26:32-0:26:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:26:32):**  probably a bit more.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:26:33):**  But it's creating an enormous wasteful process that has to change.  
**[0:26:38-0:26:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:26:38):**  Like if we like either if you're concerned by energy use, this has to change.  
**[0:26:42-0:26:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:26:42):**  If you're concerned about smoke and does long health and I mean we've just been in two years  
**[0:26:47-0:26:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:26:47):**  of mayhem because of a lot of issues let's say around breathing and issues of smoke.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:26:52):**  It's definitely a thing.  
**[0:26:53-0:26:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:26:53):**  I mean many people die of smoke every year.  
**[0:26:55-0:26:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:26:55):**  Or if you're worried about farmers' financial health because this is a massive cost that  
**[0:26:59-0:27:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:26:59):**  went up 300%.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:27:01):**  This is something we don't talk about enough, nitrogen, nitrogen, nitrogen.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:27:05):**  And it's an essential thing for plants to grow.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:27:07):**  The issue is when you put chemical night, cut more fertilizer, most of it doesn't end  
**[0:27:11-0:27:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:27:11):**  up in plants, right?  
**[0:27:12-0:27:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:27:12):**  What's the percentage?  
**[0:27:13-0:27:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:27:13):**  Yeah.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:27:14):**  Oh goodness.  
**[0:27:15-0:27:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:27:15):**  I mean there's so much variation in that but what I can say is that vast majority about  
**[0:27:19-0:27:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:27:19):**  let's say the first 50 to 60% of the nitrogen that you put on the ground is probably going  
**[0:27:26-0:27:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:27:26):**  to be going into the plant and producing that yield and the rest that they put is just chasing  
**[0:27:32-0:27:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:27:32):**  incremental yield because it's not bioavailable to the plant.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:27:36):**  And that leads to the other problem.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:27:38):**  There's so many but the big problem of runoff.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:27:41):**  What is runoff?  
**[0:27:42-0:27:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:27:42):**  It sounds weird but what just for anybody doesn't live next to a farm on a rainy day,  
**[0:27:47-0:27:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:27:47):**  what is runoff?  
**[0:27:48-0:27:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:27:48):**  Yeah.  
**[0:27:49-0:27:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:27:49):**  So the nitrogen that can't be absorbed by the plant then is washed off the field by  
**[0:27:55-0:28:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:27:55):**  rain and will enter the watershed, enter the water system.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:28:00):**  Just last month, it was announced that 100% of the rivers in the UK are polluted.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:28:06):**  Now of course, that is not only nitrogen fertilizer or nitrate but that is a big component of  
**[0:28:13-0:28:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:28:13):**  it for sure and it causes algal blooms and eutrophication in the waterways.  
**[0:28:20-0:28:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:28:20):**  It's just so bad.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:28:23):**  It's a massive issue.  
**[0:28:24-0:28:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:28:24):**  It's a massive issue.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:28:25):**  There are ways and we can talk about that for a long time but let's say with regenerative  
**[0:28:29-0:28:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:28:29):**  applying practices with the goal of regenerating soil etc. will dramatically reduce depending  
**[0:28:35-0:28:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:28:35):**  how you apply them, how you mix them with the cover crops, keeping the soil covered,  
**[0:28:39-0:28:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:28:39):**  reduces runoff, making a lot more of the nitrogen that is already in the soil bioavailable,  
**[0:28:44-0:28:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:28:44):**  getting the microbial life back into action, biodiversity etc. etc.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:28:48):**  All of those things we know they can dramatically reduce or completely reduce the need for chemical  
**[0:28:54-0:28:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:28:54):**  fertilizer but as we know that and we've seen examples that Kate Brown and many others that  
**[0:28:59-0:29:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:28:59):**  have shown that, the question is how do you make sure that a good chunk and as many as  
**[0:29:05-0:29:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:29:05):**  possible of the farmers in the UK start with them and what's the best start, best point  
**[0:29:12-0:29:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:29:12):**  and how do we incentivize them because of course we cannot ask them as they are deeply  
**[0:29:16-0:29:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:29:16):**  in red to also start paying for new machinery or paying for crop cover crop mixes and because  
**[0:29:22-0:29:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:29:22):**  this transition costs money or at least you have yield drops etc. to take care of it the  
**[0:29:27-0:29:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:29:27):**  first year.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:29:28):**  So as we know that we know it's an issue and now how do we attack that?  
**[0:29:33-0:29:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:29:33):**  Yeah exactly.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:29:34):**  We have to meet the farmers where they are and understand things from their vantage point.  
**[0:29:38-0:29:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:29:38):**  They are financially squeezed.  
**[0:29:40-0:29:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:29:40):**  So even if they had the information and totally understood how exactly to do it on their land,  
**[0:29:45-0:29:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:29:45):**  you know again they are financially probably unable to take on that risk without this buffer  
**[0:29:52-0:29:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:29:52):**  there anymore.  
**[0:29:53-0:29:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:29:53):**  Nobody would.  
**[0:29:54-0:29:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:29:54):**  Let's just be clear nobody would take on that risk.  
**[0:29:55-0:29:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:29:55):**  If you would be the company owner you wouldn't take on that risk.  
**[0:29:59-0:30:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:29:59):**  Farms are businesses.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:30:00):**  Farms are businesses and we have to speak their language which is finance and so that's  
**[0:30:03-0:30:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:30:03):**  where we realized that there was a real opportunity here actually as they're losing the subsidies  
**[0:30:09-0:30:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:30:09):**  and as prices are high and you know likely to stay high for quite a while it's an opportunity  
**[0:30:15-0:30:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:30:15):**  to help them switch on to regenerative practices which reduce their reliance on chemical nitrogen  
**[0:30:21-0:30:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:30:21):**  fertilizer through very simple gateway practices like using cover crops that help fix nitrogen  
**[0:30:27-0:30:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:30:27):**  naturally from the air.  
**[0:30:28-0:30:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:30:28):**  So that's where we started.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:30:30):**  But again if they start on this journey they're going to need to figure out how it works best  
**[0:30:35-0:30:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:30:35):**  for their land, their practice.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:30:38):**  That's that context again.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:30:39):**  And so what we realized the opportunity was was to help them access finance that would  
**[0:30:47-0:30:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:30:47):**  de-risk that transition for them because as they figure things out they may have a drop  
**[0:30:53-0:30:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:30:53):**  in yield.  
**[0:30:54-0:30:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:30:54):**  They're going to have to try things, experiment a little bit, figure out what works on their  
**[0:30:57-0:31:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:30:57):**  land and honestly rehabilitate their soil and build back up that natural fertility because  
**[0:31:04-0:31:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:31:04):**  the one thing about nitrogen fertilizer you and I didn't cover yet is the fact that  
**[0:31:08-0:31:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:31:08):**  it actually kind of kills the soil microbial life that provides that natural fertility.  
**[0:31:15-0:31:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:31:15):**  It disrupts the natural market that exists between a plant and the soil microbes where  
**[0:31:21-0:31:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:31:21):**  the plant is exuding carbon to feed the soil microbes and they then release minerals and  
**[0:31:25-0:31:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:31:25):**  nutrients back to the plant.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:31:26):**  It's a virtuous cycle.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:31:28):**  It's like a market, underground market that you didn't know was happening all the time.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:31:32):**  And so if the plant is getting a lot of this nutrient from above in a chemical form it  
**[0:31:37-0:31:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:31:37):**  kind of doesn't need to work as hard to feed the microbes and they don't get as  
**[0:31:41-0:31:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:31:41):**  much carbon and then they don't exude as much nutrients as well.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:31:45):**  So yeah, it's disrupting that and the farmers aren't building their soil organic matter  
**[0:31:50-0:31:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:31:50):**  as much as they could be by relying on nitrogen and that keeps the farmer on this input financial  
**[0:31:57-0:32:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:31:57):**  treadmill where they're reliant upon it to chase that yield.  
**[0:32:01-0:32:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:32:01):**  And so how do we get them off the treadmill?  
**[0:32:03-0:32:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:32:03):**  What's the angle?  
**[0:32:04-0:32:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:32:04):**  I mean you can of course go out and we've had them on the podcast, Perennial Fund and  
**[0:32:08-0:32:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:32:08):**  Replant Capital to a certain extent and some others that are trying to build transition  
**[0:32:13-0:32:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:32:13):**  finance too and are building transition finance funds which we've seen is a lot of work  
**[0:32:18-0:32:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:32:18):**  of course but also to raise money for this is not easy at all.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:32:23):**  You decided to take another route.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:32:24):**  You decided to see where the money already is or where the risk already is which is a  
**[0:32:29-0:32:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:32:29):**  very interesting one.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:32:30):**  So where did you say, okay, let's get transition finance but let's not set up a massive fund  
**[0:32:35-0:32:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:32:35):**  or crowdfunding platform or lending platform on our own?  
**[0:32:38-0:32:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:32:38):**  Yeah and first of all, a shout out to you and your podcast because that really helped  
**[0:32:41-0:32:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:32:41):**  inform our understanding of the issue with the Mad Agriculture Perennial Fund interviews  
**[0:32:46-0:32:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:32:46):**  and the one with or the many I should say with New Foundation Farms and really understanding  
**[0:32:52-0:32:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:32:52):**  that there are people creating funds and trying to purchase land to then switch it over and  
**[0:32:56-0:33:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:32:56):**  we're actually working with one of those funds which I can mention later.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:33:00):**  But we realized, again going back to the mission since we're mission driven and the mission  
**[0:33:05-0:33:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:33:05):**  is to help farmers transition, we realized that in order to move the needle at scale  
**[0:33:11-0:33:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:33:11):**  we needed to work with people who had those relationships with farmers already rather  
**[0:33:16-0:33:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:33:16):**  than trying to go farm to farm.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:33:18):**  Knocking on the door.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:33:19):**  Yeah.  
**[0:33:20-0:33:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:33:20):**  Knocking on the door, exactly.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:33:22):**  We also as part of our mission just to make things more challenging for ourselves because  
**[0:33:27-0:33:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:33:27):**  trying to save the planet and entrepreneurship in agriculture weren't challenging enough.  
**[0:33:32-0:33:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:33:32):**  We have a mission where we do not want to charge farmers.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:33:37):**  We want to help farmers and put money back into their pockets.  
**[0:33:41-0:33:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:33:41):**  And so we needed a way to do this at scale with people who have relationships with farmers  
**[0:33:45-0:33:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:33:45):**  but in a way that could get finance to them where they're not paying themselves for this  
**[0:33:50-0:33:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:33:50):**  transition.  
**[0:33:51-0:33:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:33:51):**  And so we realized that there was an opportunity with banks.  
**[0:33:56-0:34:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:33:56):**  Banks have relationships with the vast majority of farmers in the country and also thanks  
**[0:34:02-0:34:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:34:02):**  to some recent developments, banks now have a statutory obligation to report on the carbon  
**[0:34:10-0:34:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:34:10):**  footprint and exposure of their book of debt and to also be moving that book of debt towards  
**[0:34:17-0:34:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:34:17):**  net zero by 2040, which is wonderful.  
**[0:34:21-0:34:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:34:21):**  But nobody knows how to do that.  
**[0:34:22-0:34:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:34:22):**  Well, it's also a problem for the banks.  
**[0:34:25-0:34:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:34:25):**  If you're an agriculture bank, yeah, your emissions are going to come from practices,  
**[0:34:30-0:34:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:34:30):**  they're going to come by your clients, your farmers.  
**[0:34:33-0:34:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:34:33):**  And so you're going to need to work with them to help them implement different ways.  
**[0:34:37-0:34:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:34:37):**  Just like you have to work with your real estate portfolio if you happen to be large  
**[0:34:41-0:34:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:34:41):**  on that, you start changing the light bulbs, it's letting, I mean, depending on what's  
**[0:34:45-0:34:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:34:45):**  the state of the real estate, but there are a lot of things you can do to bring it when  
**[0:34:48-0:34:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:34:48):**  say to net zero immediately, but actually energy positive if you wanted to, but very  
**[0:34:52-0:34:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:34:52):**  close.  
**[0:34:53-0:34:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:34:53):**  I mean, there are a lot of low hanging fruit there, which is interesting for a bank as  
**[0:34:57-0:35:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:34:57):**  well because most of these are financial finance questions like yield drop in three years,  
**[0:35:02-0:35:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:35:02):**  but then interesting returns after that's a financial question.  
**[0:35:06-0:35:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:35:06):**  If you want to go to organic, there are premiums.  
**[0:35:07-0:35:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:35:07):**  We can model it out.  
**[0:35:08-0:35:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:35:08):**  We can, we can figure it out if you want to go.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:35:10):**  I mean, I know there even, I heard yesterday some interesting premiums for a region organic  
**[0:35:13-0:35:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:35:13):**  in the US if you're certified, like there are brands now like there, this is a finance  
**[0:35:18-0:35:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:35:18):**  question at the time with finance, you can sort of travel, you can bridge the three years  
**[0:35:22-0:35:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:35:22):**  to five years, whatever your field needs.  
**[0:35:25-0:35:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:35:25):**  If they're obviously interesting financial incentives after, which could be great contracts,  
**[0:35:28-0:35:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:35:28):**  off take agreements, which could be albums that finally wakes up at that time or other  
**[0:35:33-0:35:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:35:33):**  things, but this should get bankers very excited because this is a financial, we need financial  
**[0:35:38-0:35:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:35:38):**  products to bridge that, but then we need intermediaries or at least people to connect  
**[0:35:43-0:35:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:35:43):**  with the farmers to do that.  
**[0:35:45-0:35:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:35:45):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:35:46-0:35:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:35:46):**  We need to help these farmers.  
**[0:35:48-0:35:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:35:48):**  Do they get excited about it or just they get scared?  
**[0:35:50-0:35:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:35:50):**  Like the banks, the conversations because you have had money with the banks recently,  
**[0:35:53-0:35:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:35:53):**  are they interested in seeing this as an opportunity or are they being like, oh, we need to, oh  
**[0:35:58-0:36:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:35:58):**  God, we need to, we need to move now because this thing is coming and we're going to report  
**[0:36:02-0:36:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:36:02):**  and we have to, there's a lot of extra reporting we need to do because as banks we already  
**[0:36:06-0:36:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:36:06):**  need to do so much.  
**[0:36:07-0:36:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:36:07):**  What have you seen or do some of them see it as an opportunity now?  
**[0:36:11-0:36:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:36:11):**  Oh, definitely.  
**[0:36:12-0:36:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:36:12):**  I think the reaction that we've gotten with the many conversations we've had while mixed,  
**[0:36:18-0:36:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:36:18):**  everybody has been interested and supportive.  
**[0:36:21-0:36:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:36:21):**  In fact, we actually have three letters of interest from three banks about this particular  
**[0:36:27-0:36:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:36:27):**  solution that we're working on, which is really wonderful.  
**[0:36:31-0:36:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:36:31):**  One of the things to mention, you don't need to be an ag-only bank for this to be a real  
**[0:36:35-0:36:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:36:35):**  issue because many banks lend in many different areas.  
**[0:36:39-0:36:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:36:39):**  Ag might even be a small portion of their lending, but the fact is that because agriculture  
**[0:36:44-0:36:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:36:44):**  has such an outsized footprint of carbon, it's actually an outsized area of exposure  
**[0:36:50-0:36:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:36:50):**  and risk.  
**[0:36:51-0:36:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:36:51):**  Reporting, yeah.  
**[0:36:52-0:36:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:36:52):**  And risk is interesting here because if these farmers keep going bankrupt because we push  
**[0:36:56-0:37:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:36:56):**  them there, the bank at the end is on the hook for, because they have a lot of money  
**[0:37:02-0:37:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:37:02):**  outstanding there, especially in bad seasons.  
**[0:37:05-0:37:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:37:05):**  So there's a huge risk component, not just the reporting, there's a risk component here  
**[0:37:08-0:37:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:37:08):**  as well.  
**[0:37:09-0:37:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:37:09):**  And the better financial health your farmers are, your tenants, if you have a real estate  
**[0:37:12-0:37:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:37:12):**  building, the easier your job is as a banker.  
**[0:37:16-0:37:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:37:16):**  So how do you work with banks?  
**[0:37:17-0:37:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:37:17):**  How do you, or are you going to work with, because you have letters of interest, what's  
**[0:37:21-0:37:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:37:21):**  the idea?  
**[0:37:22-0:37:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:37:22):**  I mean, this can change if you reach out to Kelly in a month or so, maybe exact details  
**[0:37:26-0:37:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:37:26):**  of this might be slightly different, but at the moment, how do you envision that?  
**[0:37:29-0:37:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:37:29):**  Yeah, well, just taking a step back a little bit about the opportunity for banks here that  
**[0:37:34-0:37:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:37:34):**  we realized, and this is what really aligns those incentives along the lines of what you  
**[0:37:39-0:37:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:37:39):**  were talking about with the tram lines, right?  
**[0:37:42-0:37:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:37:42):**  It's aligning interests and incentives.  
**[0:37:45-0:37:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:37:45):**  The banks, of course, have this reporting obligation.  
**[0:37:48-0:37:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:37:48):**  One of the problems they face is just such a massive thing to quantify, just trying to  
**[0:37:52-0:37:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:37:52):**  quantify it.  
**[0:37:53-0:37:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:37:53):**  I talked to one ESG manager in a bank and she was saying, well, we're taking averages  
**[0:37:58-0:38:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:37:58):**  of averages to figure out how much carbon is sequestered in a hedgerow.  
**[0:38:02-0:38:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:38:02):**  I was like, yeah, well, how long is a piece of string?  
**[0:38:05-0:38:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:38:05):**  I mean, that's just such an impossible question to answer and an impossible or useless method  
**[0:38:10-0:38:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:38:10):**  to arrive at the answer.  
**[0:38:12-0:38:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:38:12):**  So the point is that they're scrambling trying to fill in these numbers, and we realized  
**[0:38:17-0:38:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:38:17):**  that nitrogen actually is a wonderful component area to focus on because as we talked about,  
**[0:38:23-0:38:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:38:23):**  it's such a part of the problem, but it's also incredibly easy to quantify.  
**[0:38:29-0:38:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:38:29):**  Farmers know exactly how much nitrogen they are putting to the kilogram, most likely,  
**[0:38:33-0:38:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:38:33):**  on their fields.  
**[0:38:35-0:38:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:38:35):**  And there are many ways of tracking that and looking at it over time.  
**[0:38:40-0:38:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:38:40):**  And so we realized that we have an opportunity through our data to help banks not only quantify  
**[0:38:47-0:38:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:38:47):**  their exposure on this one key metric, but also benchmark them against region farmers  
**[0:38:52-0:38:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:38:52):**  who have reduced using region practices so that we could say, hey, bank, your farmers  
**[0:38:58-0:39:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:38:58):**  are way up here.  
**[0:39:00-0:39:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:39:00):**  And let's say five years' time, based on our data, we could see that they could reasonably  
**[0:39:04-0:39:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:39:04):**  reduce 10 to 15% of that, which is a huge chunk of carbon CO2e equivalent.  
**[0:39:12-0:39:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:39:12):**  And at the end of that period, they would be more financially resilient because they  
**[0:39:18-0:39:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:39:18):**  would be less reliant on this expensive and fluctuating input.  
**[0:39:22-0:39:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:39:22):**  So most likely, data says that region farms are at least, if not more profitable once  
**[0:39:27-0:39:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:39:27):**  they've reduced those inputs.  
**[0:39:30-0:39:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:39:30):**  And in addition, they're going to be more resilient ecologically because region practices,  
**[0:39:36-0:39:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:39:36):**  for example, using cover crops, keeping the ground covered throughout the year, and having  
**[0:39:41-0:39:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:39:41):**  living roots, and relying more on natural fertility means that those farmers can weather  
**[0:39:45-0:39:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:39:45):**  weather events better like floods and droughts, which we know are increasing with climate  
**[0:39:50-0:39:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:39:50):**  change.  
**[0:39:51-0:39:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:39:51):**  So here you go, bank.  
**[0:39:53-0:39:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:39:53):**  Your farmer is hurting right now, your customer.  
**[0:39:55-0:40:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:39:55):**  You have a means that can help them through this difficult time as input costs are high  
**[0:40:00-0:40:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:40:00):**  and as they lose these subsidies, that at the end of it will mean that your customer  
**[0:40:05-0:40:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:40:05):**  is better off and you have a lower risk customer.  
**[0:40:08-0:40:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:40:08):**  So you save them from going out of business and you help them future-proof their business  
**[0:40:13-0:40:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:40:13):**  for going forward.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:40:14):**  So that's a real win-win.  
**[0:40:16-0:40:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:40:16):**  And so how will they be financing it?  
**[0:40:17-0:40:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:40:17):**  Is it lowering the, maybe it's about lowering the interest rate if a farmer, let's say,  
**[0:40:22-0:40:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:40:22):**  starts with the program, there's no the program, but with the practices and starts learning  
**[0:40:27-0:40:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:40:27):**  from nearby region farmers, starts learning, et cetera.  
**[0:40:30-0:40:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:40:30):**  Or is it actually let's finance your machinery and let's finance the cover crop mix or let's  
**[0:40:35-0:40:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:40:35):**  increase the depth, which is a risk to do that transition?  
**[0:40:38-0:40:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:40:38):**  Where do you see that?  
**[0:40:39-0:40:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:40:39):**  Like that's, let's pile on more depth on farmers, which some people will cringe now when I say  
**[0:40:43-0:40:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:40:43):**  it, or let's lower the interest rate, which I know some people are working on, like replant  
**[0:40:47-0:40:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:40:47):**  capital.  
**[0:40:48-0:40:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:40:48):**  Like if you're doing certain things connected to soil health, we can lower the interest  
**[0:40:52-0:40:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:40:52):**  rate you're paying, which what the Trilos bank is doing.  
**[0:40:55-0:41:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:40:55):**  If you have a house that is on a lower level of energy use, you can actually, you actually  
**[0:41:00-0:41:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:41:00):**  pay less in mortgage because the risk is lower.  
**[0:41:02-0:41:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:41:02):**  Yeah.  
**[0:41:03-0:41:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:41:03):**  Well, the answer is I see it as all of the above.  
**[0:41:06-0:41:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:41:06):**  I see this as a real opportunity for innovation and region finance, regenerative finance,  
**[0:41:13-0:41:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:41:13):**  because you know, of course it could be a lower interest loan and I think it should  
**[0:41:18-0:41:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:41:18):**  be, to be honest with you.  
**[0:41:19-0:41:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:41:19):**  One of our missions is to shift the needle on risk.  
**[0:41:23-0:41:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:41:23):**  For the bank or the farmer or both?  
**[0:41:25-0:41:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:41:25):**  For both, for both, because both banks and farmers now see conventional farming as normal  
**[0:41:31-0:41:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:41:31):**  and region as risky.  
**[0:41:33-0:41:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:41:33):**  And the truth couldn't be any further from that.  
**[0:41:36-0:41:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:41:36):**  It's actually region, which in the long run is going to be much less risky, much more  
**[0:41:41-0:41:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:41:41):**  resilient, and conventional, which is driving farmers into the ground and you know, driving  
**[0:41:46-0:41:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:41:46):**  the climate into crisis.  
**[0:41:48-0:41:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:41:48):**  And so we want to make the case for region being lower risk and therefore it should be  
**[0:41:52-0:41:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:41:52):**  rewarded as such through lower rates, just like you were talking about with the Triodos  
**[0:41:56-0:41:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:41:56):**  Bank and mortgages and things like that.  
**[0:41:59-0:42:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:41:59):**  So we want to make that case and we want to take it straight to the banks who can then  
**[0:42:02-0:42:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:42:02):**  take it straight to their customers and offer creative finance.  
**[0:42:06-0:42:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:42:06):**  It could be lower interest loans.  
**[0:42:08-0:42:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:42:08):**  It could be other things like grants up front simply because it reduces that bank's risk.  
**[0:42:13-0:42:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:42:13):**  You know, there's all kinds of ways that they can do it.  
**[0:42:16-0:42:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:42:16):**  And I think that comes back to one of our other ethos, which is optionality.  
**[0:42:21-0:42:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:42:21):**  We don't believe in telling farmers, you have to do this.  
**[0:42:26-0:42:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:42:26):**  What we think is the better way to go is to help them see a goal that would be beneficial  
**[0:42:32-0:42:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:42:32):**  to them, like lowering their reliance on nitrogen, and then putting options in front of them  
**[0:42:38-0:42:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:42:38):**  ways they could achieve that goal and letting them choose the one that's right for them.  
**[0:42:42-0:42:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:42:42):**  So that's why we've built our platform to help connect farmers to other farmers who  
**[0:42:47-0:42:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:42:47):**  are doing region practices so that they can... that don't necessarily have to be a customer  
**[0:42:51-0:42:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:42:51):**  of the same bank.  
**[0:42:52-0:42:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:42:52):**  I mean, this could be any farmer nearby that is in a similar position, in a similar context,  
**[0:42:58-0:42:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:42:58):**  but farming very differently.  
**[0:42:59-0:43:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:42:59):**  So you can see, feel, touch, smell, etc.  
**[0:43:02-0:43:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:43:02):**  How a transition like that could work.  
**[0:43:04-0:43:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:43:04):**  Exactly.  
**[0:43:05-0:43:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:43:05):**  Seeing is believing.  
**[0:43:06-0:43:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:43:06):**  We know that getting farmers to visit each other and having those farm walks, that's  
**[0:43:10-0:43:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:43:10):**  very, very helpful in bringing these practices to life for them.  
**[0:43:14-0:43:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:43:14):**  Farmers learn best from other farmers, and that's how this is really going to spread.  
**[0:43:18-0:43:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:43:18):**  If this were just a data issue, it might be solved by now because there is a lot of data,  
**[0:43:23-0:43:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:43:23):**  there's a lot of decision support tools out there and more power to them.  
**[0:43:27-0:43:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:43:27):**  But to get that mental shift and the confidence for that farmer to begin on that journey,  
**[0:43:34-0:43:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:43:34):**  they're going to need the financial security that even if they do have a drop in yield,  
**[0:43:38-0:43:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:43:38):**  they're not literally betting and losing the farm.  
**[0:43:41-0:43:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:43:41):**  And they also need that psychological security of knowing that there are other people who've  
**[0:43:47-0:43:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:43:47):**  been there before, who've done this, and give them some advice.  
**[0:43:51-0:43:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:43:51):**  If X happens, that farmer knows what it's like and has some thoughts on what to do in  
**[0:43:56-0:43:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:43:56):**  that context.  
**[0:43:57-0:44:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:43:57):**  So I think you cannot eliminate the human element of this.  
**[0:44:03-0:44:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:44:03):**  Farming is a competitive sport, but it's also very collaborative at the same time.  
**[0:44:07-0:44:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:44:07):**  It's one of those central paradoxes of it that I love.  
**[0:44:11-0:44:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:44:11):**  And so we want to facilitate that.  
**[0:44:12-0:44:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:44:12):**  So we've built this platform to connect farmers to each other and help visualize what region  
**[0:44:17-0:44:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:44:17):**  looks like.  
**[0:44:18-0:44:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:44:18):**  So a farmer arrives, let's say a farmer arrives now, registers him or herself on the platform  
**[0:44:23-0:44:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:44:23):**  and then you suggest like, look, actually not so far away from you.  
**[0:44:27-0:44:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:44:27):**  There are people doing very interesting things.  
**[0:44:29-0:44:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:44:29):**  You might've heard about them, et cetera, but it's actually, and those farmers that  
**[0:44:32-0:44:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:44:32):**  like these, let's say the region farmers that are a few years ahead, are they open to getting  
**[0:44:38-0:44:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:44:38):**  because they might get a lot of these requests now from them.  
**[0:44:40-0:44:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:44:40):**  I would love to have a farm work.  
**[0:44:41-0:44:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:44:41):**  I would love to see like, how do you manage that process of, because seeing is believing,  
**[0:44:45-0:44:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:44:45):**  but these farmers also have to farm.  
**[0:44:47-0:44:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:44:47):**  It's not that they can do farm tours all day, every day, the whole month.  
**[0:44:51-0:44:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:44:51):**  I mean, then nothing gets done.  
**[0:44:52-0:44:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:44:52):**  So how do you manage that process without overwhelming the, let's say the mentors?  
**[0:44:56-0:44:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:44:56):**  Yeah, well, that's a really great point.  
**[0:44:58-0:45:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:44:58):**  So I think that connecting with other farmers is important, but also connecting with agronomy  
**[0:45:02-0:45:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:45:02):**  advisors who specialize in region is important.  
**[0:45:05-0:45:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:45:05):**  And these farmers exist and we are aggregating them on our platform.  
**[0:45:09-0:45:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:45:09):**  So you can kind of have one-stop shopping, find somebody near you, fits your philosophy.  
**[0:45:15-0:45:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:45:15):**  But region advisors right now, most of them, and I was talking to some at the recent base  
**[0:45:21-0:45:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:45:21):**  conference here in the UK of region farmers, they do region advising, but it's not their  
**[0:45:26-0:45:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:45:26):**  entire book of business.  
**[0:45:27-0:45:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:45:27):**  They couldn't probably support themselves right now only on region.  
**[0:45:31-0:45:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:45:31):**  And so we'd love to change that.  
**[0:45:32-0:45:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:45:32):**  We'd love to funnel new farmers getting on this journey to them so that they can only  
**[0:45:36-0:45:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:45:36):**  focus on region, which is their passion.  
**[0:45:38-0:45:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:45:38):**  And again, in this case, the farmer wouldn't pay, but the advisor would pay you or even  
**[0:45:43-0:45:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:45:43):**  not like what the terms of business for agreed, the farmer doesn't pay, which means that it  
**[0:45:47-0:45:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:45:47):**  has to come from the agronomist advisor.  
**[0:45:50-0:45:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:45:50):**  So what we are doing is building this platform free for farmers.  
**[0:45:54-0:46:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:45:54):**  And we're not as currently stands charging anybody to be on the platform.  
**[0:46:00-0:46:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:46:00):**  We want this to be a freely available resource for the agronomy advisors, for the farmers,  
**[0:46:06-0:46:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:46:06):**  for brands like you talked about, you know, there's friends like root zero potatoes, which  
**[0:46:10-0:46:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:46:10):**  are growing carbon neutral potatoes and a wild farmed wheat, which you may know of.  
**[0:46:16-0:46:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:46:16):**  I'm smiling because they should come on, but it might take a few more months.  
**[0:46:19-0:46:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:46:19):**  But yeah, we're in touch with Wild Farm.  
**[0:46:21-0:46:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:46:21):**  I'll put a link below if you want to know more about green and very innovative ways  
**[0:46:25-0:46:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:46:25):**  of farming that.  
**[0:46:26-0:46:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:46:26):**  Definitely check out the website of Wild Farm.  
**[0:46:29-0:46:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:46:29):**  Oh my goodness.  
**[0:46:30-0:46:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:46:30):**  We could do an entire podcast session on just on wheat and nitrogen.  
**[0:46:34-0:46:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:46:34):**  I think that's a whole other topic.  
**[0:46:36-0:46:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:46:36):**  But at any rate, we're putting these resources for farmers to plug into even the carbon markets.  
**[0:46:41-0:46:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:46:41):**  You know, a lot of times we've gotten question, well, there's so much happening in the carbon  
**[0:46:45-0:46:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:46:45):**  market space.  
**[0:46:46-0:46:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:46:46):**  How are you going to be different?  
**[0:46:48-0:46:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:46:48):**  And we don't see ourselves as in competition at all with the carbon markets.  
**[0:46:53-0:46:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:46:53):**  We see ourselves as the beginning of that journey by getting off of nitrogen reliance.  
**[0:46:57-0:47:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:46:57):**  The farmers can then really begin sequestering that carbon in their soil.  
**[0:47:01-0:47:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:47:01):**  So if they want to go ahead and sell those credits later, they can.  
**[0:47:05-0:47:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:47:05):**  And we have put a different markets on our platform for them to potentially plug into,  
**[0:47:10-0:47:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:47:10):**  you know, markets like Agrena.  
**[0:47:12-0:47:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:47:12):**  So we support that, but it's up to the farmer.  
**[0:47:15-0:47:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:47:15):**  All we want to do is help them reduce their reliance on nitrogen.  
**[0:47:18-0:47:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:47:18):**  And we are working with the banks to do that.  
**[0:47:21-0:47:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:47:21):**  And so that's where our funding, our financial model comes from is working with the banks.  
**[0:47:26-0:47:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:47:26):**  Business model comes from.  
**[0:47:27-0:47:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:47:27):**  Yes, exactly.  
**[0:47:29-0:47:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:47:29):**  So we want to be free to farmers.  
**[0:47:30-0:47:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:47:30):**  I mean, in terms of finding a business model, go where the money is to a certain extent.  
**[0:47:35-0:47:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:47:35):**  Banks are known for having money.  
**[0:47:37-0:47:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:47:37):**  They are known for managing large amounts and having small margins, but they are still  
**[0:47:41-0:47:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:47:41):**  managing to be remarkably profitable over the last years.  
**[0:47:45-0:47:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:47:45):**  And yeah, it's, that's definitely an interesting choice and not trying to take a spread on  
**[0:47:50-0:47:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:47:50):**  the carbon side of things or it's where a lot of noise is happening, a lot of focus.  
**[0:47:55-0:47:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:47:55):**  But what's very interesting, I think of this conversation is that the actual, that the  
**[0:47:58-0:48:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:47:58):**  big elephant in the room is nitrogen and nitrogen oxide, which is very potent.  
**[0:48:04-0:48:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:48:04):**  Let's not underestimate that.  
**[0:48:05-0:48:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:48:05):**  And it's very visible literally because of smoke and very visible literally because of  
**[0:48:09-0:48:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:48:09):**  runoff and probably let's say that the rest of the general world, as we're going into  
**[0:48:14-0:48:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:48:14):**  the carbon hype, we'll start paying attention to, hopefully paying attention to nitrogen  
**[0:48:18-0:48:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:48:18):**  because it's much more eminent also on the balance sheet of a farmer and the balance  
**[0:48:22-0:48:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:48:22):**  sheet of a bank apparently.  
**[0:48:23-0:48:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:48:23):**  And the balance sheet of a bank.  
**[0:48:25-0:48:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:48:25):**  That's exactly it.  
**[0:48:26-0:48:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:48:26):**  So, you know, shout out to Mark Carney for really bringing the financial system into  
**[0:48:31-0:48:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:48:31):**  the climate crisis solution and driving this change.  
**[0:48:35-0:48:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:48:35):**  And, you know, I think he's been a big part of this focus on getting banks to report on  
**[0:48:40-0:48:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:48:40):**  this and also shift their financing away from the source of the problem or trying to reduce  
**[0:48:47-0:48:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:48:47):**  it.  
**[0:48:48-0:48:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:48:48):**  And, you know, banks have placed an outsized role in funding the sources of the climate  
**[0:48:51-0:48:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:48:51):**  crisis.  
**[0:48:52-0:48:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:48:52):**  And I think that they are really starting to step up and recognize that and then try  
**[0:48:58-0:49:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:48:58):**  to instead fund the solution.  
**[0:49:00-0:49:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:49:00):**  And my goodness, this is a big part of that solution.  
**[0:49:03-0:49:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:49:03):**  And to end with a few final questions, as we can talk about nitrogen and all of that  
**[0:49:07-0:49:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:49:07):**  for hours, but I want to keep that for another interview.  
**[0:49:10-0:49:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:49:10):**  If you would be in that investor chair, like let's say you had a billion pound sterling  
**[0:49:14-0:49:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:49:14):**  to invest or 10 billion, like a large amount, what would you focus on?  
**[0:49:18-0:49:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:49:18):**  What would be your priorities to get funded or to invest in because this is an investment  
**[0:49:23-0:49:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:49:23):**  fund?  
**[0:49:24-0:49:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:49:24):**  It can be very long, long term.  
**[0:49:25-0:49:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:49:25):**  I don't care.  
**[0:49:26-0:49:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:49:26):**  But what would you focus on?  
**[0:49:27-0:49:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:49:27):**  Yeah.  
**[0:49:28-0:49:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:49:28):**  Well, I, you know, again, kind of would want to focus on solutions to the problem, things  
**[0:49:34-0:49:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:49:34):**  that are helping draw down carbon as opposed to just being less bad.  
**[0:49:37-0:49:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:49:37):**  But I think the other thing is there are always start with the problem in entrepreneurship.  
**[0:49:42-0:49:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:49:42):**  You know, value is created when you solve a problem for somebody.  
**[0:49:46-0:49:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:49:46):**  And so look at what the problems are in the system.  
**[0:49:49-0:49:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:49:49):**  And some of these problems may not be considered as sexy, but they're real burning hair.  
**[0:49:53-0:49:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:49:53):**  For example, I can think of, you know, more sustainable farmers, region farmers wanting  
**[0:49:58-0:50:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:49:58):**  to sell more directly to customers because right now it's very difficult for them to  
**[0:50:05-0:50:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:50:05):**  get any kind of premium on their produce.  
**[0:50:08-0:50:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:50:08):**  There's not a region certification like there is for organic.  
**[0:50:12-0:50:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:50:12):**  There's not a known crafted market for those products.  
**[0:50:16-0:50:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:50:16):**  Consumer awareness of what region even is right now is still quite low.  
**[0:50:20-0:50:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:50:20):**  So that would be a real problem area that the farmers themselves are facing.  
**[0:50:24-0:50:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:50:24):**  And you know, we've talked about the challenges with the transition.  
**[0:50:27-0:50:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:50:27):**  Well, once you have transitioned, how do you get rewarded for having done that transition?  
**[0:50:31-0:50:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:50:31):**  You need markets.  
**[0:50:32-0:50:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:50:32):**  Exactly.  
**[0:50:33-0:50:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:50:33):**  You need markets.  
**[0:50:34-0:50:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:50:34):**  Another thing would be, you know, you could sell direct consumers, but combinable crops,  
**[0:50:38-0:50:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:50:38):**  they have a real challenge because their produce just gets lumped in with unsustainable high  
**[0:50:44-0:50:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:50:44):**  input produce and sold at the same low price.  
**[0:50:48-0:50:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:50:48):**  So somebody who can help solve that problem, that would be huge.  
**[0:50:51-0:50:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:50:51):**  And you'd probably be able to further incentivize a bigger shift these massive crops away from  
**[0:50:56-0:51:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:50:56):**  high inputs if they knew that they could get rewarded for it on the other end.  
**[0:51:00-0:51:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:51:00):**  Yeah.  
**[0:51:01-0:51:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:51:01):**  The more we talk about it, actually, it should be live.  
**[0:51:03-0:51:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:51:03):**  No, maybe.  
**[0:51:04-0:51:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:51:04):**  No, it will be live today actually.  
**[0:51:05-0:51:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:51:05):**  Paul Lightfoot, in the interview, I was messing up the production schedule.  
**[0:51:09-0:51:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:51:09):**  Lightfoot, Paul Lightfoot, I'll put it in the chat as well, or in the description below,  
**[0:51:14-0:51:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:51:14):**  runs a newsletter, is investor himself, and we interviewed him on carbon negative foods  
**[0:51:19-0:51:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:51:19):**  or negative foods as he called it.  
**[0:51:21-0:51:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:51:21):**  So that's the biggest lever for him, at least.  
**[0:51:23-0:51:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:51:23):**  We had a very interesting discussion on creating these markets consumers wanted.  
**[0:51:27-0:51:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:51:27):**  Carbon labeling is coming and now it's up to us to create the brands that pay the farmer  
**[0:51:32-0:51:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:51:32):**  and the farmers, but also make sure we tell and explain and share that story of soil and  
**[0:51:37-0:51:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:51:37):**  the complexity.  
**[0:51:39-0:51:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:51:39):**  But there's some very interesting things happening.  
**[0:51:40-0:51:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:51:40):**  I mean, you mentioned Wildfarmed, but there are luckily others that are moving that needle  
**[0:51:45-0:51:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:51:45):**  because we need much better brands.  
**[0:51:47-0:51:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:51:47):**  We need much better produce products, process things, because not everything can be sold  
**[0:51:51-0:51:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:51:51):**  fresh grain as a great example to get it in our house or get it in our shopping carts  
**[0:51:55-0:51:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:51:55):**  or to get it in our home, which is a, yeah, probably you can put a billion dollars to  
**[0:51:59-0:52:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:51:59):**  work there or a billion pounds if you wanted to.  
**[0:52:02-0:52:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:52:02):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:52:03-0:52:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:52:03):**  So if those brands pop up or crop up, I should say, then we can put them on our platform  
**[0:52:08-0:52:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:52:08):**  because at the end of the day, we're an ecosystem player and we want to support all the players  
**[0:52:12-0:52:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:52:12):**  who are doing good in this space.  
**[0:52:14-0:52:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:52:14):**  So yeah, we are going through banks to reach their customers to help get them financing  
**[0:52:20-0:52:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:52:20):**  for this transition to de-risk it for them.  
**[0:52:23-0:52:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:52:23):**  And that's how we see ourselves as moving the needle.  
**[0:52:26-0:52:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:52:26):**  And final question, if you had a magic wand, what would you change in this space?  
**[0:52:30-0:52:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:52:30):**  In any space?  
**[0:52:31-0:52:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:52:31):**  It could be literally global consciousness if you wanted to, or better taste, which probably  
**[0:52:35-0:52:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:52:35):**  what I would say, but at what, in terms of flavor and in terms of clothes or decoration  
**[0:52:40-0:52:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:52:40):**  or anything, I'm literally only talking about food, but what would you change if you had  
**[0:52:43-0:52:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:52:43):**  the magic power to change one thing only?  
**[0:52:45-0:52:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:52:45):**  Oh my God, so many things, but the one thing I would change is externalities.  
**[0:52:51-0:52:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:52:51):**  Right now the polluter doesn't pay.  
**[0:52:54-0:53:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:52:54):**  And right now the farmer is being vilified as the polluter, even though the entire system  
**[0:53:00-0:53:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:53:00):**  incentivizes the farmer to farm this way right now.  
**[0:53:02-0:53:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:53:02):**  And so if we simply costed in the environmental cost of this nitrogen, the chemical inputs,  
**[0:53:11-0:53:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:53:11):**  then it would not be remotely economical to farm this way.  
**[0:53:14-0:53:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:53:14):**  It's already kind of becoming that way because the cost of nitrogen is predicated on the  
**[0:53:18-0:53:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:53:18):**  cost of natural gas and energy, which as we all know, especially here in Europe, has risen  
**[0:53:23-0:53:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:53:23):**  a lot recently.  
**[0:53:24-0:53:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:53:24):**  So I would cost that in and that would drive system change.  
**[0:53:29-0:53:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:53:29):**  But I also understand that that's very politically unpopular and would lead to all kinds of other  
**[0:53:33-0:53:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:53:33):**  problems like much higher food costs, which could hurt a lot of people too.  
**[0:53:37-0:53:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:53:37):**  So I don't want to pretend that it is a simple solution, but I think that those externalities  
**[0:53:44-0:53:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:53:44):**  are a huge driver of the problem that we've found ourselves in, this massive rut.  
**[0:53:48-0:53:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:53:48):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:53:49-0:53:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:53:49):**  The true cost of the food we pay, I think they did the study, the Rockefellers paid  
**[0:53:53-0:53:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:53:53):**  for the study in the US.  
**[0:53:54-0:54:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:53:54):**  I think it's 3x what we pay in the US yearly for food and the true cost in terms of health  
**[0:54:00-0:54:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:54:00):**  and environmental and social, what they could calculate.  
**[0:54:03-0:54:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:54:03):**  So imagine it's still a lot higher is about 3x.  
**[0:54:07-0:54:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:54:07):**  That's saying we should charge that now and everything should be 3x because of course  
**[0:54:10-0:54:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:54:10):**  that would lead to huge disruption, but we need to figure out an off-ramp of that as  
**[0:54:15-0:54:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:54:15):**  well because we're paying it anyway.  
**[0:54:17-0:54:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:54:17):**  It's not that it is coming, the bill is coming and we're already paying for the dirty rivers,  
**[0:54:22-0:54:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:54:22):**  we're paying for a lot of this indirectly and directly on the health side of things.  
**[0:54:26-0:54:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:54:26):**  So it's definitely coming.  
**[0:54:28-0:54:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:54:28):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:54:29-0:54:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:54:29):**  And farmers right now, it's not the most profitable model even right now without it being priced  
**[0:54:34-0:54:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:54:34):**  in.  
**[0:54:35-0:54:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:54:35):**  And in the UK, a lot of other places, but definitely the UK, our cost of food here is  
**[0:54:40-0:54:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:54:40):**  actually quite low compared to how it used to be like right post-war and everything.  
**[0:54:45-0:54:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:54:45):**  And even then we have people in food poverty and the use of food banks has grown exponentially  
**[0:54:50-0:54:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:54:50):**  just in the past decade.  
**[0:54:52-0:54:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:54:52):**  So Houston, we have a problem and we really need a lot of creative minds to work towards  
**[0:54:56-0:54:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:54:56):**  solving it.  
**[0:54:57-0:55:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:54:57):**  And I hope that maybe your podcast can really inspire a lot more to get working on this.  
**[0:55:01-0:55:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:55:01):**  Let's hope so.  
**[0:55:02-0:55:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:55:02):**  We need more people in this space building things, that's for sure.  
**[0:55:05-0:55:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:55:05):**  I want to thank you so much Kelly for your time in this wild journey that you're on and  
**[0:55:10-0:55:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:55:10):**  looking forward to follow it to check in over time and to see how we can get some of those  
**[0:55:15-0:55:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:55:15):**  big banks to start changing, working with their customers, actually working with instead  
**[0:55:20-0:55:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:55:20):**  of...  
**[0:55:21-0:55:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:55:21):**  Working with their customers.  
**[0:55:22-0:55:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:55:22):**  And being part of the solution just as we want farming to be part of the solution.  
**[0:55:25-0:55:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:55:25):**  Exactly.  
**[0:55:26-0:55:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:55:26):**  Well, thank you so much, Koon.

**[0:56:17-0:56:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:56:17):**  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[0:56:22-0:56:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:56:22):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  
**[0:56:26-0:56:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:56:26):**  Why are we doing this course after a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of  
**[0:56:30-0:56:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:56:30):**  audio asking the question how to put money to work in regenerating soils and I've been  
**[0:56:34-0:56:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:56:34):**  following the space since 2011 and recording these podcasts since 2016 we thought it was  
**[0:56:39-0:56:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:56:39):**  time to share our lessons learned.  
**[0:56:41-0:56:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:56:41):**  What have we seen in the space over the last years?

**[0:57:15-0:57:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:57:15):**  designers, holistic management, consultants, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:57:19-0:57:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:57:19):**  People that are building soil at scale and the investors who are putting their own money  
**[0:57:23-0:57:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:57:23):**  to work through their family office or as private individuals or people who are putting  
**[0:57:27-0:57:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:57:27):**  other people's money to work through foundations, institutional capital banks, insurance companies,

**[0:57:35-0:57:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:57:35):**  No.  
**[0:57:36-0:57:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:57:36):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:57:38-0:57:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:57:38):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.  
**[0:57:42-0:57:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:57:42):**  And I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very  
**[0:57:47-0:57:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:57:47):**  different means.  
**[0:57:48-0:57:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:57:48):**  So I'm inviting you if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[0:57:53-0:57:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:57:53):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[0:57:56-0:57:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:57:56):**  Thank you.  
**[0:57:57-0:57:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:57:57):**  So what is this course?  
**[0:57:58-0:58:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:57:58):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides.  
**[0:58:04-0:58:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:58:04):**  So you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:58:06-0:58:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:58:06):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:58:11-0:58:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:58:11):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:58:17-0:58:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:58:17):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[0:58:21-0:58:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:58:21):**  if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:58:23-0:58:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:58:23):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:58:28-0:58:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:58:28):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:58:32-0:58:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:58:32):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:58:36-0:58:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:58:36):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:58:37-0:58:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:58:37):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:58:39-0:58:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:58:39):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:58:42-0:58:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:58:42):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:58:45-0:58:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:58:45):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:58:47-0:58:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:58:47):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.  
**[0:58:53-0:58:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:58:53):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking, click on

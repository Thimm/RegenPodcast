**[0:00:17-0:00:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:00:17):**  Zealand where regenerative agriculture is really taking off.  
**[0:00:22-0:00:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:00:22):**  Enjoy!  
**[0:00:24-0:00:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:00:24):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:00:28-0:00:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:00:28):**  Everything as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:30-0:00:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:00:30):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:34-0:00:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:00:34):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:00:40-0:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:00:40):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:00:44):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:46-0:00:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:00:46):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:00:50-0:00:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:00:50):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:00:53-0:00:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:00:53):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:00:57-0:01:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:00:57):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:02-0:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:01:02):**  Before we get started, I've been recording these interviews next to my day job and I  
**[0:01:06-0:01:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:01:06):**  will definitely continue to do so and release about an episode a month.  
**[0:01:10-0:01:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:01:10):**  But at the same time I would love to take this further, share more interviews, there  
**[0:01:14-0:01:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:01:14):**  are many more stories to share on investing in regenerative food and agriculture.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:01:18):**  More depth, improve the quality, maybe even doing some video series.  
**[0:01:23-0:01:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:01:23):**  So I started a Patreon community which makes it easy to support creators like myself.

**[0:01:39-0:01:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:01:39):**  And now, without further ado, the interview.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:01:43):**  Enjoy!  
**[0:01:44-0:01:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:01:44):**  So welcome to the podcast, I'm Koen van Zeyen, your host.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:01:47):**  Today I'm joined by Joff Burke, founder of Agro Ecological all the way down in New  
**[0:01:50-0:01:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:01:50):**  Zealand.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:01:51):**  This is an experiment where we try to dive deep into regenerative agriculture projects  
**[0:01:55-0:01:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:01:55):**  on the ground and where we're also recording video as we go over the projects with Joff  
**[0:01:59-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:01:59):**  today.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:02:00):**  Find all the links below in the description and please let us know what you think.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:02:03):**  Agro Ecological is a New Zealand based impact investment manager and advisory firm focused  
**[0:02:08-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:02:08):**  on farmland.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:02:09):**  Welcome Joff!  
**[0:02:10-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:02:10):**  Morning, thank you and good evening.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:02:12):**  Yeah, good evening, good morning.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:02:13):**  We're very far apart and there's a slight delay sometimes in the connection so it's  
**[0:02:18-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:02:18):**  a good experiment to do.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:02:20):**  For the first time actually on this podcast we have a video connection so it's going to  
**[0:02:23-0:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:02:23):**  be very interesting to see how that turns out.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:02:26):**  But to start with a personal question, why and how did you end up in soil?  
**[0:02:31-0:02:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:02:31):**  I mean you are from New Zealand where farming is a huge industry but still you could have  
**[0:02:35-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:02:35):**  chosen many other career paths.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:02:37):**  Yes, it's a good question.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:02:39):**  I'll try and keep it short.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:02:40):**  We could be here all morning slash evening.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:02:43):**  So essentially I'm from a farming background, I was brought up on a beef and sheep property.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:02:48):**  My father always said that if we had had a restaurant we would have done it from paddock  
**[0:02:51-0:02:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:02:51):**  to plate.  
**[0:02:52-0:03:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:02:52):**  So the family was involved with farming, livestock buying, butchery, meat exporting, so pretty  
**[0:03:00-0:03:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:03:00):**  much everything else except restauranting.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:03:02):**  So I think it's kind of in you and you have an appetite for it.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:03:07):**  And you know I went and studied it at university but I think like a lot of young men in the  
**[0:03:14-0:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:03:14):**  1980s who were from farming backgrounds I ended up in investment banking because farming  
**[0:03:17-0:03:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:03:17):**  wasn't looking terribly clever.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:03:18):**  I don't think in many places in the 80s, but I just got to that point in life where I think  
**[0:03:25-0:03:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:03:25):**  I couldn't escape my genes and they started sort of vibrating particularly strongly and  
**[0:03:30-0:03:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:03:30):**  so I ended up pursuing particularly organic agriculture because I got interested, well  
**[0:03:36-0:03:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:03:36):**  you know firstly because I was involved with futures and options I started to get interested  
**[0:03:40-0:03:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:03:40):**  from the deal point of view because this organic stuff seemed a lot more expensive so therefore  
**[0:03:46-0:03:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:03:46):**  did that mean the farmers were making more money and you know having covered some of  
**[0:03:50-0:03:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:03:50):**  it at university I could sort of intellectually get my head around it and that New Zealand  
**[0:03:54-0:03:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:03:54):**  would probably be quite good at it.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:03:57):**  And so that's why I went back and did my postgraduate work back in New Zealand at Lincoln University  
**[0:04:01-0:04:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:04:01):**  and then it sort of expanded from there so yeah that's trying to keep it short.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:04:06):**  That's how we got into it.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:04:07):**  Thank you for that yeah because otherwise we could easily cover a full hour probably  
**[0:04:11-0:04:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:04:11):**  on this easy.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:04:13):**  So tell me agroecological what it is, what you do, who is we in that sense, how many  
**[0:04:19-0:04:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:04:19):**  people are you and why I mean you are from New Zealand but what's the reason of the base  
**[0:04:25-0:04:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:04:25):**  in New Zealand?  
**[0:04:26-0:04:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:04:26):**  Well we are in New Zealand now but I started off in the UK.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:04:30):**  I've spent probably 20 out of the last 25 years in the UK.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:04:33):**  Because you lived there for a long time yeah?  
**[0:04:35-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:04:35):**  Yeah that's right and worked at the organic research centre over there in Berkshire for  
**[0:04:39-0:04:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:04:39):**  a number of years so came back to New Zealand about five years ago.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:04:43):**  So yeah I mean the name is because it kind of does what it says on the tin.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:04:48):**  It's one of those those names that captures exactly what it's about and I think just what  
**[0:04:56-0:04:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:04:56):**  we wanted to try and achieve.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:04:57):**  So we're a small team, there's just a handful of us but I think what we really wanted to  
**[0:05:01-0:05:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:05:01):**  try and achieve was genuine transformation to drive change and one of the limiting factors  
**[0:05:07-0:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:05:07):**  around the perception of ecological agriculture or regenerative agriculture however you want  
**[0:05:12-0:05:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:05:12):**  to term it is that it is less profitable and that people do it purely for philosophical  
**[0:05:20-0:05:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:05:20):**  almost as religious reasons and you know my experience of having been on a lot of farms  
**[0:05:26-0:05:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:05:26):**  is that that that was wrong and particularly here in a New Zealand context that you had  
**[0:05:31-0:05:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:05:31):**  the ability to create a more profitable system particularly if you could capture a premium  
**[0:05:36-0:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:05:36):**  but even potentially without capturing that premium you had the ability to run a leaner  
**[0:05:40-0:05:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:05:40):**  more resilient system and so really it was about that.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:05:44):**  It was about proving that we could create a system that was more environmentally positive  
**[0:05:52-0:05:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:05:52):**  and that we would also drive good if not better financial returns and being able to demonstrate  
**[0:05:59-0:06:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:05:59):**  that through actually doing it.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:06:01):**  So that's really sort of how it came about if you like.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:06:04):**  And it's really based because we used to term organic a lot, we used to term regenerative  
**[0:06:08-0:06:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:06:08):**  a lot, for you it's really that's it's almost a step.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:06:12):**  I mean organic is the official certifier but you cannot really be organic or the official  
**[0:06:17-0:06:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:06:17):**  certification you cannot really be organic without being regenerative at least in your  
**[0:06:22-0:06:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:06:22):**  experience and in your circumstances.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:06:24):**  Yeah I mean that's how I view it.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:06:26):**  I know there are different views around the world and people who say this sort of corporate  
**[0:06:29-0:06:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:06:29):**  organic and stuff like this but for me if you're doing it as well as you possibly can  
**[0:06:35-0:06:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:06:35):**  then you're relying on ecological science or agroecological science.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:06:39):**  So if you like being regenerative there's a byproduct of implementing sound robust best  
**[0:06:46-0:06:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:06:46):**  if you like agroecological management practice which QED makes you organic because all those  
**[0:06:53-0:07:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:06:53):**  techniques are things that fall within the sort of the specifics of organic certification.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:07:02):**  And really organic is just you know either way I view it is that organic is important  
**[0:07:05-0:07:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:07:05):**  because it's a stamp, it's independently audited and it gives consumers some comfort and that  
**[0:07:11-0:07:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:07:11):**  drives the premium and that's important because it makes it more profitable and the more robust  
**[0:07:17-0:07:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:07:17):**  and profitable it is and the more likely it is to drive more money into it and then see  
**[0:07:22-0:07:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:07:22):**  more organic agriculture being rolled out.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:07:25):**  And you know it's been successful for 20-30 years but really hasn't expanded you know  
**[0:07:31-0:07:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:07:31):**  perhaps as much as we we need it to thinking about climate change and other sort of environmental  
**[0:07:36-0:07:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:07:36):**  challenges and thinking about how much capital goes into agriculture as a whole and how much  
**[0:07:42-0:07:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:07:42):**  of that goes into organic.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:07:44):**  And research as well.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:07:46):**  Yeah exactly so there's still a fraction of capital flow going into you know this very  
**[0:07:51-0:07:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:07:51):**  important or what we view as very important area in terms of creating good food, creating  
**[0:07:56-0:08:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:07:56):**  good environmental outcomes, adapting to and dealing with climate change and the consequences  
**[0:08:01-0:08:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:08:01):**  of climate change.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:08:02):**  Yeah I just wanted to bring up the next picture as you see the soil from underneath.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:08:05):**  I think there's a fundamental misunderstanding in organic where many people see it as just  
**[0:08:12-0:08:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:08:12):**  replacing a few the chemical inputs you're using with some organic inputs probably getting  
**[0:08:17-0:08:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:08:17):**  a lower yield if you do that like if you don't push the system as far as you're doing as  
**[0:08:23-0:08:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:08:23):**  you're mentioning like you can really push it much further meaning that you get a lower  
**[0:08:27-0:08:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:08:27):**  yield which are usually the farms you see in ending up in research and thus you have  
**[0:08:31-0:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:08:31):**  that tendency of saying we cannot feed the world with this because everybody has 20 or  
**[0:08:36-0:08:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:08:36):**  30 percent lower yields which is not the case if you look at I mean it really depends where  
**[0:08:41-0:08:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:08:41):**  you take these examples plus there's only a fraction of the money went into research  
**[0:08:46-0:08:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:08:46):**  so far meaning that we're really at the beginning I've seen farms that are maybe five or sometimes  
**[0:08:52-0:08:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:08:52):**  even ten times better in yields and you're mentioning before and actually Nicole we should  
**[0:08:57-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:08:57):**  focus on profit per acre not use breaker but there where we haven't pushed the organic  
**[0:09:02-0:09:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:09:02):**  system as far as we can in yields but also in profits and also in quality and we're just  
**[0:09:07-0:09:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:09:07):**  at the beginning when it's a 20 30 year thing and compared to 50 or 60 maybe in in so it's  
**[0:09:12-0:09:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:09:12):**  there's an interesting discussion going on around that which makes me always feel a bit  
**[0:09:17-0:09:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:09:17):**  uncomfortable as people say but can you actually feed the planet with that and I say yes if  
**[0:09:22-0:09:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:09:22):**  you do it well but that's always the case if you do it in a bad way and you just replace  
**[0:09:26-0:09:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:09:26):**  a few things here and there of course you can't because you're just you're a bad farmer  
**[0:09:31-0:09:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:09:31):**  basically yeah sorry that's not really a question but it's more a statement yeah no but it's  
**[0:09:36-0:09:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:09:36):**  a good one because it does come up and then then we get into the whole debate well why  
**[0:09:40-0:09:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:09:40):**  is it that people are going hungry is it because we're not producing enough food or in the  
**[0:09:44-0:09:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:09:44):**  West we've got sort of a high obesity level so clearly we're not lacking producing food  
**[0:09:48-0:09:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:09:48):**  yeah it's about 2.5 billion with a business more about logistics and availability and  
**[0:09:55-0:10:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:09:55):**  poverty and these types of things so we we don't have a an inability to produce sufficient  
**[0:10:00-0:10:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:10:00):**  food we absolutely do and from an organic perspective certainly the systems I know and  
**[0:10:05-0:10:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:10:05):**  know well there is minimal yield penalty if any and certainly you know from our point  
**[0:10:12-0:10:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:10:12):**  of view from pastoral point of view from permanent crops such as kiwifruit there is no reason  
**[0:10:17-0:10:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:10:17):**  why we wouldn't be in the top three five percent into purely for production certainly in terms  
**[0:10:23-0:10:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:10:23):**  of profitability so yeah why is that because we're going to dive into dairy and kiwi in  
**[0:10:28-0:10:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:10:28):**  a minute but let's dive a bit into the nuts and bolts of not doing it the conventional  
**[0:10:35-0:10:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:10:35):**  let's say conventional organic way just replacing a few inputs from chemical to organic and  
**[0:10:39-0:10:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:10:39):**  then calling it a day no you're you're saying organic is meant to be and I've had this discussion  
**[0:10:43-0:10:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:10:43):**  before where people say the spirit of organic is constant tinkering and constant changing  
**[0:10:48-0:10:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:10:48):**  and that's how they designed it now the certification in some places is very rigid but that wasn't  
**[0:10:53-0:10:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:10:53):**  how the original pioneer started and so what's your let's say your take you can take a concrete  
**[0:10:59-0:11:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:10:59):**  example we might go into kiwis later on but if you want to take a complete example now  
**[0:11:04-0:11:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:11:04):**  what would be your your definition of regenerative organic well you raised an interesting point  
**[0:11:08-0:11:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:11:08):**  and this is one I we often talk about and that is that it's often perceived to be so  
**[0:11:15-0:11:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:11:15):**  organic agriculture is often perceived to be a case of substituting conventional inputs  
**[0:11:21-0:11:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:11:21):**  for organic inputs and so that's fundamentally flawed that's not what it is and those are  
**[0:11:26-0:11:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:11:26):**  usually the systems that fail and so for instance you'll see farmers who say organic doesn't  
**[0:11:30-0:11:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:11:30):**  work I've literally had that conversation with someone and but they would effectively  
**[0:11:35-0:11:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:11:35):**  gone down there input substitution route so take the conventional input out put the organic  
**[0:11:40-0:11:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:11:40):**  one in and so that you know that doesn't work and you know if someone was going to adopt  
**[0:11:45-0:11:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:11:45):**  that approach we could tell them beforehand before they even got started that it isn't  
**[0:11:47-0:11:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:11:47):**  going to work because what you need to do is is redesign your system or if you like  
**[0:11:53-0:11:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:11:53):**  even say put in place a new system and that's about management and it's about you know what's  
**[0:11:58-0:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:11:58):**  going on up in here just as much as it is what's going on down in the soil and the pasture  
**[0:12:03-0:12:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:12:03):**  so that's and that's where you get success through creating that health that resilience  
**[0:12:07-0:12:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:12:07):**  and so on in your system but it comes back to that management system it's not just take  
**[0:12:12-0:12:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:12:12):**  that thing out put that one in instead and that's crucial because generally most farmers  
**[0:12:16-0:12:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:12:16):**  will think that's what it's about because that's how they've been educated to think  
**[0:12:20-0:12:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:12:20):**  of farming is that then the most difficult piece like that changing the mind of the farmer  
**[0:12:25-0:12:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:12:25):**  or or nudging the mind of the farmer or yeah I would say certainly right now experience  
**[0:12:31-0:12:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:12:31):**  in New Zealand is that there are a lot of people who are very interested more than I  
**[0:12:34-0:12:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:12:34):**  have ever seen before there's much less of the sort of you know laughing into your hand  
**[0:12:40-0:12:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:12:40):**  or behind your back yeah yeah because people are recognizing that actually you know what  
**[0:12:45-0:12:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:12:45):**  the current system isn't working there's a whole lot of regulation coming in around water  
**[0:12:49-0:12:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:12:49):**  quality because water quality is not great as a consequence of intensive dairying and  
**[0:12:54-0:12:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:12:54):**  people in New Zealand don't like it which people anywhere don't like they're degrading  
**[0:12:58-0:13:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:12:58):**  water quality and so you know that change is being driven that's not the only sort of  
**[0:13:03-0:13:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:13:03):**  change but through that it's starting changing people think well how do I farm to be within  
**[0:13:08-0:13:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:13:08):**  the regulations to be if you like to have a social license to farm and then to also  
**[0:13:13-0:13:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:13:13):**  make it profitable so I can continue farming with my family and perhaps pass it on to my  
**[0:13:18-0:13:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:13:18):**  sons or daughters or whoever it is so those sort of questions are really quite in play  
**[0:13:23-0:13:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:13:23):**  strongly in New Zealand and so that means I am finding that I'm engaging with farmers  
**[0:13:29-0:13:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:13:29):**  and talking to them about well let's develop the system let's develop that system what  
**[0:13:33-0:13:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:13:33):**  are you thinking about doing and everyone that I'm talking with is saying yeah well  
**[0:13:38-0:13:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:13:38):**  we're interested in you know finding out more about organic how do we do it or you know  
**[0:13:42-0:13:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:13:42):**  how do we make that system work so I would say right now and this is based on our New  
**[0:13:47-0:13:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:13:47):**  Zealand experience that it's a really good time to be seeking to put those systems in  
**[0:13:53-0:13:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:13:53):**  place because I think farmers are very open to that but certainly that it's up here that's  
**[0:13:58-0:14:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:13:58):**  the most important part of the system to convert that is the appetite for the genuine interest  
**[0:14:04-0:14:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:14:04):**  in it is good and the great thing about New Zealand is that you get a lot of very capable  
**[0:14:08-0:14:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:14:08):**  farmers you know it's a big sector here it's a major sector so capable young men and women  
**[0:14:13-0:14:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:14:13):**  go into the sector we'd probably like to see more going in but there's plenty out there  
**[0:14:18-0:14:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:14:18):**  and what's interesting is that if you like the most motivated ones are the ones who are  
**[0:14:23-0:14:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:14:23):**  interested in pursuing this more sustainable line and you know they have more of an appetite  
**[0:14:28-0:14:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:14:28):**  for it and that's good because it does require you to be ahead of the curve a little bit  
**[0:14:34-0:14:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:14:34):**  you know to be in sort of the top 10 20 percent of conventional operators that those are the  
**[0:14:39-0:14:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:14:39):**  guys who are going to make it make it work and it puts you aside a bit in your communities  
**[0:14:44-0:14:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:14:44):**  yeah yeah how big is the farming industry and you mentioned before in a conversation  
**[0:14:50-0:14:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:14:50):**  we had it's basically I mean you never have to put the animals inside it has the perfect  
**[0:14:54-0:14:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:14:54):**  climate is there changing a lot in the climate as well is that like a risk for the next 20  
**[0:14:59-0:15:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:14:59):**  30 years remarkably benign climate you know we're very lucky with our climate so animals  
**[0:15:05-0:15:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:15:05):**  can be outside grazing all year round to some extent that does depend on your your soil  
**[0:15:11-0:15:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:15:11):**  but there are not large parts of New Zealand turning on a not large farming parts that  
**[0:15:16-0:15:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:15:16):**  are under snow pretty much nowhere in the North Island will be getting snow in the farm  
**[0:15:22-0:15:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:15:22):**  except up on the peaks the hills or something but but it's not it's not like northern Europe  
**[0:15:27-0:15:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:15:27):**  or or North America it just doesn't and grass grass will grow all year round in large areas  
**[0:15:32-0:15:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:15:32):**  of the country it might slow down or stop in some places in sort of July you know the  
**[0:15:37-0:15:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:15:37):**  middle of winter but otherwise you know you keep growing so you know to compensate for  
**[0:15:43-0:15:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:15:43):**  that lack of pasture growth you're far you harvest if you harvest in your peak season  
**[0:15:49-0:15:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:15:49):**  and you feed it out yeah so we've got a fantastic climate we've also got rain and good soils  
**[0:15:57-0:16:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:15:57):**  and sunshine so we have sunshine we have heat units we have water we have that ability to  
**[0:16:02-0:16:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:16:02):**  go outside all year round that ability to grow things is is the basis of the country's  
**[0:16:08-0:16:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:16:08):**  economy really you know there's a certain amount of tourism which is pretty important  
**[0:16:12-0:16:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:16:12):**  particularly when sort of Lord of the Rings and films like that get made and people come  
**[0:16:15-0:16:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:16:15):**  down and visit but yeah it's really about food production and that comes back to the  
**[0:16:19-0:16:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:16:19):**  climate the quality of the climate we have which is is a real blessing and it's almost  
**[0:16:24-0:16:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:16:24):**  all export I assume yeah look there's four million people in this country and I think  
**[0:16:29-0:16:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:16:29):**  we produce enough food so I've heard various sort of measures but you know sort of 40 50  
**[0:16:34-0:16:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:16:34):**  60 million so I think literally 95 percent of what New Zealand produces is exported so  
**[0:16:40-0:16:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:16:40):**  in the context of the global economy from an agriculture point of view we're extremely  
**[0:16:44-0:16:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:16:44):**  important dairy I think we're around one third of globally traded dairy product I think we're  
**[0:16:50-0:16:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:16:50):**  the biggest exporter of kiwifruit more zest free at least is the biggest export of kiwifruit  
**[0:16:55-0:17:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:16:55):**  the New Zealand kiwifruit marketer lamb with a number one exporter of lamb so and apples  
**[0:17:03-0:17:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:17:03):**  we're not number one but we're very big from again from an export point of view just because  
**[0:17:08-0:17:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:17:08):**  you know pretty much everything we produce whatever it is will be going overseas and  
**[0:17:13-0:17:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:17:13):**  just on this slide one thing I always like to ask measurable environmental performance  
**[0:17:17-0:17:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:17:17):**  what are you measuring what would you like to measure because it's not always the same  
**[0:17:20-0:17:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:17:20):**  thing and what our customers asking what our investors asking you're working with what's  
**[0:17:25-0:17:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:17:25):**  your experience being your experience on the measurement part okay so those are some interesting  
**[0:17:29-0:17:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:17:29):**  questions so that there's been a rise in impact investment but investors we are talking to  
**[0:17:35-0:17:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:17:35):**  seldom and I'm like I think I can only think of one but they're seldom articulating we  
**[0:17:41-0:17:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:17:41):**  need these particular metrics we need to see that you're measuring this pretty much everyone  
**[0:17:46-0:17:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:17:46):**  we talked to are super happy with the approach we're taking and and this kind of a case of  
**[0:17:52-0:17:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:17:52):**  or we say we're going to measure these things and they go well that's that sounds fantastic  
**[0:17:56-0:18:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:17:56):**  so and I think I think it's so juxtaposed with what they're otherwise seeing so there's  
**[0:18:02-0:18:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:18:02):**  such a sort of a separation between if you like the norm and what we're doing so in terms  
**[0:18:07-0:18:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:18:07):**  of what we would like to measure well some of them are relatively straightforward to  
**[0:18:10-0:18:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:18:10):**  do and that's biodiversity is a fairly obvious one some are very important but much more  
**[0:18:15-0:18:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:18:15):**  technically difficult to do which is water quality but in doing that there are mechanisms  
**[0:18:21-0:18:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:18:21):**  you can use and then also we're looking to work with regulators and certain catchments  
**[0:18:27-0:18:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:18:27):**  who are monitoring water quality and to do that over time you know some of these things  
**[0:18:31-0:18:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:18:31):**  are not quick fixes but we're quite keen to see how we can record that that change and  
**[0:18:36-0:18:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:18:36):**  how that happens at sort of a micro level so at the farm level and then also in the  
**[0:18:41-0:18:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:18:41):**  wider catchment level particularly when you if you start to get multiple farms under under  
**[0:18:46-0:18:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:18:46):**  management then it'd be interesting to see how you can identify those those differences  
**[0:18:52-0:18:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:18:52):**  but otherwise it becomes things such as you know you talk about putting particular environmental  
**[0:18:57-0:19:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:18:57):**  mitigations or management actions in place that you say are going to make a difference  
**[0:19:01-0:19:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:19:01):**  so the first thing would be to do to measure is that well have you actually done those  
**[0:19:04-0:19:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:19:04):**  things that you said you were going to do and to some extent you know science hasn't  
**[0:19:08-0:19:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:19:08):**  caught up with good management practice so an example of that would be if you sow a really  
**[0:19:14-0:19:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:19:14):**  diverse mixture pasture you know some of that's very deep rooting and so you're better holding  
**[0:19:18-0:19:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:19:18):**  on to nutrient in that soil then if you've just got really very short rooted grasses  
**[0:19:25-0:19:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:19:25):**  well that isn't picked up for instance in New Zealand in the nutrient monitoring system  
**[0:19:30-0:19:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:19:30):**  so you get no benefit out of having that pasture system versus having say a very short rooted  
**[0:19:35-0:19:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:19:35):**  ryegrass so the science to some extent has to catch up in terms of its ability to measure  
**[0:19:40-0:19:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:19:40):**  those differences but you know nonetheless those are the sort of things we're putting  
**[0:19:44-0:19:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:19:44):**  in place because we know they make a difference from a lot of different points of view you  
**[0:19:48-0:19:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:19:48):**  know health of the animals and performance as well as retaining nutrient and so on and  
**[0:19:54-0:19:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:19:54):**  so forth so.  
**[0:19:55-0:19:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:19:55):**  Are you measuring carbon like your your big neighbour Australia is doing as there is there  
**[0:19:59-0:20:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:19:59):**  is a sort of a market there but I don't know the situation that well in your part of the  
**[0:20:05-0:20:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:20:05):**  world.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:20:06):**  We're ranking up again actually and probably literally the last couple of weeks carbon  
**[0:20:11-0:20:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:20:11):**  has become much more of a topic with farmers that I'm talking to so there is a billion  
**[0:20:16-0:20:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:20:16):**  trees program as it's called here in New Zealand where the government is encouraging people  
**[0:20:19-0:20:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:20:19):**  to get out there and plant trees and you may be familiar with manuka honey you probably  
**[0:20:25-0:20:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:20:25):**  had on your toast this morning and so there's an opportunity to plant more of that manuka  
**[0:20:31-0:20:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:20:31):**  and make oil and honey and also lock up some carbon so it's a really interesting area it's  
**[0:20:38-0:20:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:20:38):**  just growing and super interested in that because I think you know more silver pastoral  
**[0:20:43-0:20:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:20:43):**  type systems something that is of interest to us and it totally links in with that so  
**[0:20:50-0:20:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:20:50):**  and they look be great to be able to measure that and create more income and yeah so I  
**[0:20:56-0:21:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:20:56):**  think that's something that you will see increasing it's something we will pursue on farm you  
**[0:21:00-0:21:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:21:00):**  know without.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:21:01):**  Yeah it's probably one of the fastest ways as well to rebuild soil carbon levels as well.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:21:07):**  Absolutely and trees grow super fast in this country you know something that might take  
**[0:21:10-0:21:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:21:10):**  60 80 years and say the UK will grow here in about 2025 so it's you know dramatically  
**[0:21:17-0:21:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:21:17):**  different as I said the warm width just makes such a difference.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:21:22):**  Great you're one of the biggest players as a country I mean one of your marketing the  
**[0:21:27-0:21:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:21:27):**  marketing company that most people when they eat a kiwi at least one in two or something  
**[0:21:31-0:21:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:21:31):**  comes from from New Zealand why are you pushing for a regenerative organic and why is it such  
**[0:21:37-0:21:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:21:37):**  an interesting development at the moment in New Zealand?  
**[0:21:42-0:21:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:21:42):**  So there's the pure market interest so you attract a premium for being organic and the  
**[0:21:48-0:21:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:21:48):**  market is growing you know sharply North America and Asia so that that's the exciting dollar  
**[0:21:53-0:21:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:21:53):**  driven end of it if you like and which is quite compelling and that there is a marked  
**[0:21:58-0:22:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:21:58):**  shortage of supply and the ability to change that rapidly in a short space of time just  
**[0:22:04-0:22:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:22:04):**  simply doesn't exist so that that's very compelling.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:22:08):**  The second thing from a production point of view is that we have identified a sort of  
**[0:22:16-0:22:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:22:16):**  unique agronomic advantage in a particular location and it's connected to how kiwifruit  
**[0:22:22-0:22:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:22:22):**  grow or how they are made to grow and essentially kiwifruit need to have winter chilling so  
**[0:22:28-0:22:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:22:28):**  they need to be.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:22:30):**  And that means winter not chilling chilling in a big warehouse or something.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:22:35):**  No that's right not in your fridge no no don't put them in your fridge no it means you know  
**[0:22:39-0:22:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:22:39):**  you need cold winter and that stimulates bud break so growth and yield which obviously  
**[0:22:47-0:22:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:22:47):**  means you get more fruit so that's very important and there is a synthetic input used conventionally  
**[0:22:53-0:23:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:22:53):**  to stimulate that activity which is not permitted organically and that's a factor in the biggest  
**[0:23:01-0:23:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:23:01):**  kiwifruit producing region in New Zealand where there is a bit of a lack of winter chilling  
**[0:23:05-0:23:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:23:05):**  and they have to use that and so the absence of that in an organic system in that region  
**[0:23:12-0:23:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:23:12):**  means you tend to get a yield penalty.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:23:15):**  Basically meaning sorry to summarize that the region where most of the kiwis are grown  
**[0:23:18-0:23:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:23:18):**  now in New Zealand either due to climate change or in general doesn't have that cold winter  
**[0:23:25-0:23:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:23:25):**  or doesn't have the cold winter anymore meaning they have to use a strong chemical or a chemical  
**[0:23:31-0:23:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:23:31):**  substance to fake the winter and meaning they cannot really switch to organic tomorrow because  
**[0:23:37-0:23:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:23:37):**  they would not be able to use that substance thus won't have the same yields as before.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:23:43):**  Correct yeah so guys do guys do convert and you know eventually get there but you will  
**[0:23:50-0:23:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:23:50):**  the average yield is lower.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:23:52):**  So you chose to be somewhere else I mean that's the target you chose a region where it does  
**[0:23:57-0:23:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:23:57):**  get cold.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:23:58):**  Yeah look there's no question that the region that we have identified is better for growing  
**[0:24:03-0:24:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:24:03):**  organic kiwifruit there's just no doubt and it's because of that extra winter chilling  
**[0:24:08-0:24:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:24:08):**  because actually in the summer the region I'm talking about has higher heat units so  
**[0:24:14-0:24:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:24:14):**  it's kind of a double whammy you're getting better winter chilling but then you're getting  
**[0:24:17-0:24:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:24:17):**  more heat through the summer.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:24:19):**  So it's significant it essentially means you can deliver conventional type yields but with  
**[0:24:26-0:24:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:24:26):**  the organic premium on top.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:24:29):**  And your costs are lower as well are your inputs in kiwi production is that a big difference  
**[0:24:33-0:24:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:24:33):**  or?  
**[0:24:34-0:24:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:24:34):**  Well your cost of license is cheaper and your production is high value.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:24:40):**  The actual operating cost is similar so that is not a marked difference between the two  
**[0:24:47-0:24:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:24:47):**  it'll depend on what you're specifically doing with your management system.  
**[0:24:51-0:24:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:24:51):**  We think there is some scope to be lower in cost of production if you can set the system  
**[0:24:57-0:25:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:24:57):**  up right and that's what's attractive one of the attractive things about doing a bareland  
**[0:25:01-0:25:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:25:01):**  development and if you're actually going to secure gold organic license you actually have  
**[0:25:07-0:25:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:25:07):**  to have a bareland development.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:25:08):**  What does that mean?  
**[0:25:09-0:25:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:25:09):**  So you take existing kiwifruit in the ground and cut across to gold under an organic system  
**[0:25:17-0:25:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:25:17):**  it has to be bareland development.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:25:19):**  What does that development you mentioned a specific type BNL development what does that  
**[0:25:24-0:25:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:25:24):**  mean?  
**[0:25:25-0:25:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:25:25):**  So I'm really just meaning yeah you know literally bareland.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:25:29):**  So really from the ground up starting from zero.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:25:33):**  How long does it take to before the vines are not doing grapes but doing kiwifruits?  
**[0:25:38-0:25:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:25:38):**  Yeah so you'll get a harvest in year three it won't be a really proper commercial harvest  
**[0:25:44-0:25:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:25:44):**  you'll get a more commercial type harvest in year four you'd still expect to increase  
**[0:25:49-0:25:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:25:49):**  from that point on for a few years but yeah.  
**[0:25:53-0:25:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:25:53):**  And when does it mature or is there a certain moment it goes down again?  
**[0:25:56-0:26:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:25:56):**  It doesn't go down they sort of go on forever they're absolute monsters kiwifruit they're  
**[0:26:02-0:26:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:26:02):**  just beasts.  
**[0:26:03-0:26:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:26:03):**  So they can be a little susceptible to wet feet and to wind but the way you develop them  
**[0:26:09-0:26:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:26:09):**  you have sort of nets and shelter and so on and so forth so they're very well protected  
**[0:26:13-0:26:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:26:13):**  from wind and you it's obviously important to find out about your soils that they're  
**[0:26:17-0:26:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:26:17):**  going into that they're free draining you know fertile and free draining because wet  
**[0:26:20-0:26:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:26:20):**  feet are not good for kiwifruit but if you have those variables in place as I say they  
**[0:26:24-0:26:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:26:24):**  are monsters.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:26:25):**  And in terms of soil what's their impact on the soil is there fertilizer necessary what  
**[0:26:32-0:26:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:26:32):**  kind of are you doing any intercropping is it a monoculture plant or what how does the  
**[0:26:37-0:26:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:26:37):**  kiwifruit plant feel or vine feels happy?  
**[0:26:42-0:26:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:26:42):**  Yeah so obviously there's largely a monoculture because it's a permanent crop but within that  
**[0:26:49-0:26:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:26:49):**  you know we look at doing a lot of different things in between the rows you can sow you  
**[0:26:55-0:27:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:26:55):**  know legume like clover and then you go through and cut it and have it so that it shoots out  
**[0:27:00-0:27:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:27:00):**  of the mower under the vines so you're getting a mulch which is obviously got nitrogen in  
**[0:27:05-0:27:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:27:05):**  it you can also plant plants that will attract beneficial insects so buckwheat and and faecida  
**[0:27:12-0:27:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:27:12):**  and things like that so there are different things you can do and one of the things we're  
**[0:27:15-0:27:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:27:15):**  very interested in doing which which would be quite new and innovative is to plant a  
**[0:27:22-0:27:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:27:22):**  habitat around the outside so it acts as shelter but also as a habitat for beneficial insects  
**[0:27:30-0:27:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:27:30):**  to sort of create that reservoir if you like of beneficial biodiversity and we're quite  
**[0:27:36-0:27:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:27:36):**  interested in doing that and because kiwifruit aren't necessarily the sexiest plants for  
**[0:27:41-0:27:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:27:41):**  pollinators so you need to do your best to create an environment where pollinators are  
**[0:27:46-0:27:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:27:46):**  motivated to to stay there and spend some time there so that's part of what we we seek  
**[0:27:52-0:27:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:27:52):**  to do with the system as well which isn't generally otherwise done as a deliberate action  
**[0:27:58-0:28:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:27:58):**  in setting up the system but that's what I was talking about in terms of you know setting  
**[0:28:02-0:28:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:28:02):**  up a sort of a purpose-built system for organic performance for organic production.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:28:07):**  And in terms of the structure obviously without giving investment advice which is not what  
**[0:28:12-0:28:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:28:12):**  we're doing but what are you looking I mean you're looking to develop a farm basically  
**[0:28:15-0:28:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:28:15):**  from the ground up you have an interesting team here what's in terms of the invest store  
**[0:28:21-0:28:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:28:21):**  putting my invest store head on what's in terms of the invest impact investment what  
**[0:28:26-0:28:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:28:26):**  what's the structure looking for is this a one-off thing are you going to do multiple  
**[0:28:30-0:28:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:28:30):**  what do you see if we talk in a few years from now and the first one has his first semi-commercial  
**[0:28:36-0:28:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:28:36):**  harvest where what would you be looking at?  
**[0:28:39-0:28:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:28:39):**  Yeah I think it's interesting because it's it's not easy to deploy big chunks of capital  
**[0:28:45-0:28:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:28:45):**  into into kiwifruit the average size of a kiwifruit orchard in New Zealand is something  
**[0:28:49-0:28:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:28:49):**  like 2.8 or 3 hectares for a gold orchard it's very small you know that that said one  
**[0:28:55-0:28:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:28:55):**  of the developments we're looking at is would be about 15 hectares and the canopy would  
**[0:28:59-0:29:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:28:59):**  actually be quite large in the particular region we're I think going to be the second  
**[0:29:04-0:29:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:29:04):**  largest individual holding so.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:29:07):**  And canopy here just to be clear means canopy of trees or canopy of nets?  
**[0:29:12-0:29:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:29:12):**  Yeah so it's canopy means if you like the area that's got vines growing okay and so  
**[0:29:18-0:29:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:29:18):**  we think of it as as a netted area because we have nets over the top but basically canopy  
**[0:29:22-0:29:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:29:22):**  is really referring to the kiwifruit so where you can see all those sort of leaves because  
**[0:29:27-0:29:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:29:27):**  if you're standing under kiwifruit in the sort of the peak of the season as it were  
**[0:29:32-0:29:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:29:32):**  there's not a lot of light coming through you know it's quite sort of a lot darker.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:29:36):**  And the nets you put for birds or what's the purpose of the nets?  
**[0:29:40-0:29:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:29:40):**  Wind, wind is the biggest thing it's a bit of a help with birds obviously but primarily  
**[0:29:46-0:29:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:29:46):**  it's wind.  
**[0:29:47-0:29:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:29:47):**  And would it be because I've seen systems on I think Propagate Ventures was sharing  
**[0:29:54-0:30:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:29:54):**  a system for I remember it was apples or something but in I think in Argentina where they planted  
**[0:30:00-0:30:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:30:00):**  a lot of very high trees around certain apple farms so they basically caught the wind so  
**[0:30:06-0:30:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:30:06):**  they created nets but on the side and made of trees and they've been doing that for 20  
**[0:30:11-0:30:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:30:11):**  or 30 I think even much longer without netting it basically they managed to slow down the  
**[0:30:15-0:30:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:30:15):**  wind that came through their orchards because it was such a probably the same with kiwis  
**[0:30:20-0:30:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:30:20):**  it's such a threat but not from above but basically on the side.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:30:23):**  Historically they've had trees around them but some of the first trees they used to plant  
**[0:30:28-0:30:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:30:28):**  they found they were they were havens for a pest the pest really loved to live on that  
**[0:30:33-0:30:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:30:33):**  tree and then they'd sort of jump into the orchard so that wasn't quite so successful.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:30:38):**  So yeah you know they've learned a lot more about that.  
**[0:30:41-0:30:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:30:41):**  Nets are extremely effective as I say we will utilize trees as well or perhaps you know  
**[0:30:49-0:30:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:30:49):**  shrubs more people hate to plant trees but ones that will create habitat you know losing  
**[0:30:56-0:30:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:30:56):**  using a lot of native plants and so on and so forth.  
**[0:30:59-0:31:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:30:59):**  So just sorry there was this this side just to come back to the structure you'll be doing  
**[0:31:02-0:31:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:31:02):**  a one-off for now is it I mean depending on that you'll be doing more?  
**[0:31:07-0:31:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:31:07):**  Yeah that's right at the moment we've got we've got a one-off project but there are  
**[0:31:10-0:31:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:31:10):**  other opportunities coming up in the pipeline as I say look you're not going to deploy big  
**[0:31:16-0:31:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:31:16):**  institutional type amounts of money into kiwifruit in New Zealand.  
**[0:31:20-0:31:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:31:20):**  So if you are thinking the type of investor who might look at this it might be you know  
**[0:31:25-0:31:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:31:25):**  high net worths and family offices and those types of investors because yeah look one or  
**[0:31:31-0:31:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:31:31):**  two projects but there will be the opportunity over time I imagine given what we're seeing  
**[0:31:37-0:31:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:31:37):**  that's our expectation that there will be other other assets come up.  
**[0:31:40-0:31:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:31:40):**  But from an offshore capital point of view bare land development works as well as well  
**[0:31:46-0:31:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:31:46):**  as it does from the production sort of point of view and the license point of view and  
**[0:31:50-0:31:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:31:50):**  that's because you have a the overseas investment office to go through here in New Zealand.  
**[0:31:56-0:32:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:31:56):**  So that's a process and there are boxes that have to be ticked so of course you're adding  
**[0:32:01-0:32:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:32:01):**  a lot of value to land if you develop land from bare land into kiwifruit.  
**[0:32:05-0:32:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:32:05):**  Yeah because currently the land is used for either cattle or it's bare land right?  
**[0:32:12-0:32:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:32:12):**  Yeah well the sort of land we're looking at is it's either grazing it's got animals grazing  
**[0:32:17-0:32:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:32:17):**  on it or it's being cropped for animal feed.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:32:22):**  Other properties they might be doing some annual cropping you know possibly onions or  
**[0:32:25-0:32:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:32:25):**  something like that but whatever it is you're doing you're still taking it and turning it  
**[0:32:30-0:32:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:32:30):**  into a much higher value product or land use while you're turning it to kiwifruit.  
**[0:32:37-0:32:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:32:37):**  Great I think we're going to switch to a much much bigger project you're working on which  
**[0:32:41-0:32:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:32:41):**  is actually project regeneration which obviously caught my attention so let's go to that.  
**[0:32:48-0:32:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:32:48):**  So you mentioned dairy a couple of times and we mentioned dairy actually a couple of times  
**[0:32:52-0:32:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:32:52):**  and we have a nice overview of a number of dairy operations here.  
**[0:32:57-0:33:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:32:57):**  It's a huge industry in New Zealand it's a big part of your economy I mean you're the  
**[0:33:01-0:33:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:33:01):**  30% of all dairy exported in the world probably comes from your place in the world.  
**[0:33:08-0:33:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:33:08):**  What are the main issues?  
**[0:33:09-0:33:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:33:09):**  Why is this such an interesting space for let's say an impact investor to get involved  
**[0:33:15-0:33:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:33:15):**  and why are you focusing on the dairy industry?  
**[0:33:18-0:33:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:33:18):**  I think there's probably a couple reasons why we're focusing on dairy.  
**[0:33:23-0:33:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:33:23):**  One is it's the biggest industry in the agricultural sector in New Zealand and by some way.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:33:28):**  The second thing would be that it has a reputation for being dirty and polluting.  
**[0:33:35-0:33:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:33:35):**  As we can see in this river here.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:33:37):**  Yeah dairy is referred to as dirty dairying and there has been a dramatic fall in water  
**[0:33:45-0:33:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:33:45):**  quality in these sort of catchments where dairy intensification has increased over in  
**[0:33:53-0:33:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:33:53):**  a relatively short period of time.  
**[0:33:55-0:34:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:33:55):**  You know we're not talking sort of 50 years we're talking more like sort of 20 years and  
**[0:34:00-0:34:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:34:00):**  so that is becoming socially unacceptable.  
**[0:34:04-0:34:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:34:04):**  Yeah I was just going to switch to the slide where you share a bit more about that like  
**[0:34:07-0:34:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:34:07):**  peak cows I think the first time I've seen that.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:34:11):**  That's right.  
**[0:34:12-0:34:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:34:12):**  Yeah so that some of those headlines you know this is coming from the Minister of the Environment  
**[0:34:17-0:34:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:34:17):**  and the Minister for Primary Industries or for Agriculture in effect.  
**[0:34:22-0:34:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:34:22):**  So they're saying you know we pretty much think we've reached peak cow.  
**[0:34:25-0:34:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:34:25):**  So basically there's this mood of change if you like and it's being brought about also  
**[0:34:30-0:34:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:34:30):**  by actual regulation so nutrient loads are being kept and so that the change is coming  
**[0:34:36-0:34:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:34:36):**  which is a good thing.  
**[0:34:37-0:34:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:34:37):**  A lot of farmers don't think it is but we saw that that was created an opportunity because  
**[0:34:42-0:34:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:34:42):**  you know where someone sees I know it's all changing and it's bad we'll have to leave  
**[0:34:47-0:34:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:34:47):**  or we see opportunity in that rather than something to run away from and the opportunity  
**[0:34:54-0:35:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:34:54):**  is to go and acquire farms transform those into regenerative systems that are generating  
**[0:35:01-0:35:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:35:01):**  better environmental outcomes but also you know good financial outcomes and make also  
**[0:35:08-0:35:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:35:08):**  make make people sort of take a different view on farming that it doesn't have to be  
**[0:35:13-0:35:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:35:13):**  about just making dollars and instead of you know abusing the environment that actually  
**[0:35:19-0:35:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:35:19):**  we can we can make that environmental outcome sort of better we can deliver better biodiversity  
**[0:35:24-0:35:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:35:24):**  we can improve water quality from where it is now and still make money and make you know  
**[0:35:30-0:35:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:35:30):**  milk that is high value so create better financial outcomes as well as environmental.  
**[0:35:35-0:35:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:35:35):**  You know I think it's you know intellectually we reject that concept that there is a trade-off  
**[0:35:41-0:35:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:35:41):**  between environment and profitability we see the two actually as linked you do a better  
**[0:35:46-0:35:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:35:46):**  job of the environmental and you will achieve a better outcome on the financial and frankly  
**[0:35:51-0:35:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:35:51):**  it has to happen that the sort of the environmental consequence is no longer something that can  
**[0:35:58-0:36:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:35:58):**  just be swept aside or or you know classified as someone else's problem you know that has  
**[0:36:03-0:36:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:36:03):**  to be deliberately confronted and regulators are seeking to confront and deal with it and  
**[0:36:09-0:36:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:36:09):**  that's the environment we go into and so that's why it's a good time in our view to be looking  
**[0:36:15-0:36:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:36:15):**  at dairy.  
**[0:36:16-0:36:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:36:16):**  Yeah so basically you're you're going in and and is it going to be one watershed or one  
**[0:36:22-0:36:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:36:22):**  region where because obviously if you're all sharing the same river with all the farmers  
**[0:36:27-0:36:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:36:27):**  in a region maybe the farm you pick or that's for sale you buy you turn into beyond organic  
**[0:36:34-0:36:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:36:34):**  or organic regenerative are you figuring out also which farm to pick to have the most impact  
**[0:36:39-0:36:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:36:39):**  on on that river or is that something you're you're thinking about how to have that ecosystem  
**[0:36:44-0:36:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:36:44):**  or watershed level thinking where are those I would almost I call it in the show every  
**[0:36:49-0:36:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:36:49):**  time acupuncture points where you can have the most potential impact is that something  
**[0:36:54-0:36:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:36:54):**  you're thinking of?  
**[0:36:55-0:37:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:36:55):**  Yeah absolutely it is and certainly with the project we're looking at the moment it's it's  
**[0:37:00-0:37:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:37:00):**  very much focused on a catchment now obviously there are neighbouring catchments that you  
**[0:37:04-0:37:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:37:04):**  can you can look to as well but it is focused on a particular catchment and then you know  
**[0:37:11-0:37:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:37:11):**  you know we're looking to working closely with those who have been studying those those  
**[0:37:16-0:37:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:37:16):**  areas you know particularly the regulators I'm thinking have been recording a lot of  
**[0:37:21-0:37:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:37:21):**  information and will have very good insight as to you know those key areas but you know  
**[0:37:27-0:37:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:37:27):**  certainly we're looking to so we target farms for instance that will have waterways going  
**[0:37:32-0:37:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:37:32):**  through them which isn't actually that challenging to find necessarily in New Zealand and particularly  
**[0:37:36-0:37:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:37:36):**  in this particular catchment so there's a real opportunity to make a difference there  
**[0:37:42-0:37:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:37:42):**  but that kind of insight is really useful and valuable and I think the way we we will  
**[0:37:47-0:37:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:37:47):**  do that in this situation is through that that sort of collective approach so working  
**[0:37:51-0:37:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:37:51):**  in with other stakeholders in the catchments and that's the great thing at the moment their  
**[0:37:54-0:38:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:37:54):**  appetite to make a difference and how we go about doing that and historically it's always  
**[0:38:00-0:38:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:38:00):**  sort of been a bit of a stick oh you must stop doing this and stop doing that and you  
**[0:38:04-0:38:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:38:04):**  know that's achieved a certain amount but this becomes I think a much more powerful  
**[0:38:07-0:38:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:38:07):**  sort of driver of change and deliverer of improved outcomes and so yeah but it's a really  
**[0:38:15-0:38:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:38:15):**  look it's a really good question but we do try and specifically target areas and even  
**[0:38:21-0:38:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:38:21):**  farms that will have a an above the line degree of improvement and impact.  
**[0:38:28-0:38:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:38:28):**  And in terms of let's say you buy a farm and I would see the first day or the day before  
**[0:38:34-0:38:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:38:34):**  you bought it and five years later what are the main differences apart from getting your  
**[0:38:39-0:38:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:38:39):**  organic certification what would I see as main differences are different grazing and  
**[0:38:43-0:38:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:38:43):**  are going to be trees are the cows looking different or the different types of cows is  
**[0:38:48-0:38:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:38:48):**  there what's the if a farmer would visit because I obviously don't see too many differences  
**[0:38:52-0:38:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:38:52):**  I mean I would see a tree but if a farmer would visit and what would he or she see in  
**[0:38:57-0:39:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:38:57):**  in like a couple of years what would be like whoa okay that I didn't expect or that that's  
**[0:39:02-0:39:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:39:02):**  completely different from what I know.  
**[0:39:03-0:39:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:39:03):**  Cows will have really big smiles on their faces can they just they'll be much happier  
**[0:39:08-0:39:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:39:08):**  you'll see that but no and look in reality you will notice dramatically different looking  
**[0:39:13-0:39:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:39:13):**  pasture and the number of species in that pasture.  
**[0:39:16-0:39:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:39:16):**  Going from what to what what's your goal and what are they now?  
**[0:39:20-0:39:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:39:20):**  Well generally you'll be going from potentially just pure rye grass or rye grass with a little  
**[0:39:24-0:39:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:39:24):**  bit of white clover to so let's say two varieties to something that might have 15 or 20 different  
**[0:39:30-0:39:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:39:30):**  species in it so a variety of clovers maybe some lucer there's for trefoil chicory plantain.  
**[0:39:38-0:39:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:39:38):**  You plant that in or it comes back naturally?  
**[0:39:40-0:39:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:39:40):**  Yeah yeah so you you have a rotation so you don't go in year one and sort of you know  
**[0:39:47-0:39:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:39:47):**  plow up everything and sow new grass otherwise you're going to be struggling to feed your  
**[0:39:50-0:39:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:39:50):**  animals but you'll have a system of renewal and you might accelerate that a little bit  
**[0:39:55-0:40:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:39:55):**  you might increase it a little bit but broadly you will operate on that rotation of renewal  
**[0:40:00-0:40:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:40:00):**  to bring the new pasture in and you'll also find to an extent that once you have a level  
**[0:40:05-0:40:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:40:05):**  of that new pasture in the cows will also start to help spread it around the farm.  
**[0:40:11-0:40:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:40:11):**  Whatever livestock system you have that would happen so yeah that's how you make it sort  
**[0:40:15-0:40:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:40:15):**  of work so that's something you will notice is a difference.  
**[0:40:19-0:40:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:40:19):**  Trees you'll see a lot more trees on farms that that we're operating and that might be  
**[0:40:25-0:40:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:40:25):**  natives up into scrappy steep gullies that aren't terribly productive could be plantations  
**[0:40:30-0:40:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:40:30):**  in those areas could be more of a silver pastoral type system where you have rows of whatever  
**[0:40:36-0:40:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:40:36):**  it might be could be apple trees could be timber trees could be nut trees in paddocks.  
**[0:40:41-0:40:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:40:41):**  Is that something that happens already a lot?  
**[0:40:43-0:40:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:40:43):**  Is that something you see in New Zealand or that's pretty pretty new because the pictures  
**[0:40:47-0:40:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:40:47):**  I've seen the picture you shared in the presentation there there's hardly a tree inside.  
**[0:40:51-0:40:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:40:51):**  Yeah yeah no now particularly New Zealand dairy farms historically it's always been  
**[0:40:56-0:41:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:40:56):**  seen that if you had a tree it meant it was growing somewhere that couldn't grow grass  
**[0:41:00-0:41:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:41:00):**  so you had to get rid of the tree so you could grow more grass.  
**[0:41:02-0:41:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:41:02):**  The idea of sort of shelter for the animals and you know this I think just didn't come  
**[0:41:07-0:41:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:41:07):**  into the equation.  
**[0:41:08-0:41:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:41:08):**  That's starting to change and so people are starting to sort of see trees maybe as being  
**[0:41:13-0:41:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:41:13):**  an asset which obviously they are so but you will see a lot more trees on farms and in  
**[0:41:19-0:41:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:41:19):**  ways that you wouldn't normally expect to see trees on farms as well so I mean people  
**[0:41:24-0:41:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:41:24):**  will talk about riparian planting in New Zealand but we will do that and to a high level and  
**[0:41:29-0:41:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:41:29):**  I don't just mean lots of it but in terms of thinking about the species we are putting  
**[0:41:35-0:41:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:41:35):**  in place and what else are they doing apart from retaining nutrient because there's only  
**[0:41:40-0:41:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:41:40):**  so much they're doing at that point you know when you're a meter or two away from the river  
**[0:41:43-0:41:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:41:43):**  there's only so much they're doing but so well what else what are the other benefits  
**[0:41:48-0:41:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:41:48):**  we're getting out of out of those sort of systems and are there other things we can  
**[0:41:51-0:41:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:41:51):**  plant so you know you know we've talked in the past you know about medicinal type plantings  
**[0:41:57-0:42:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:41:57):**  so the animals can self-medicate and other sources of fodder as well as the shelter and  
**[0:42:03-0:42:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:42:03):**  you know just rubbing posts you know this type of thing so there's you know trees are  
**[0:42:07-0:42:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:42:07):**  pretty cool things and there are a lot of ways we can use them there's a real drive  
**[0:42:10-0:42:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:42:10):**  to see more trees being planted in this country and there's the carbon factor and the ability  
**[0:42:15-0:42:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:42:15):**  to to drive you know more income out of the use of trees as well so there's there's a  
**[0:42:20-0:42:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:42:20):**  lot of compelling reasons and that's a definite way you're going to see a physical difference  
**[0:42:24-0:42:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:42:24):**  on the farm look another way might be that you change the breed of livestock you're dealing  
**[0:42:29-0:42:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:42:29):**  with so I don't mean radically changing it from from dairy cows to something else but  
**[0:42:34-0:42:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:42:34):**  I mean the breed of cow you're utilizing you may change in order to have a more or better  
**[0:42:40-0:42:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:42:40):**  adapted animal for an organic system so one that's quite robust produces off fodder resilient  
**[0:42:46-0:42:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:42:46):**  cows easily and all those sort of good qualities that that you want in an organic system and  
**[0:42:52-0:42:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:42:52):**  in terms of the yeah no no I we call them what is the Botox cows or whatever you you  
**[0:42:59-0:43:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:42:59):**  give them yeah they're they probably won't survive very well in a in a few more trees  
**[0:43:06-0:43:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:43:06):**  some fodder and some herbal plants they wouldn't know what to do with that and in terms of  
**[0:43:10-0:43:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:43:10):**  the other end on the sales part I mean I read here your I mean there are two main companies  
**[0:43:15-0:43:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:43:15):**  one cooperative and the other not you can sell to is there any direct market is there  
**[0:43:20-0:43:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:43:20):**  any margins apart from the organic premium you're taking your you're thinking about like  
**[0:43:26-0:43:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:43:26):**  at some point is there going to be a more farm to fork to come back to to your family's  
**[0:43:31-0:43:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:43:31):**  business previously is there more of a direct link is there something that you can play  
**[0:43:34-0:43:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:43:34):**  with in in New Zealand or because it's export you have to go through these big players because  
**[0:43:39-0:43:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:43:39):**  otherwise you can't yeah it's I mean it's a great idea and one I always loved in the  
**[0:43:45-0:43:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:43:45):**  in the UK but the reality is we just don't have the population here I think if you're  
**[0:43:51-0:43:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:43:51):**  very close to a significant town and particularly if you're close to a tourist type town in  
**[0:43:58-0:44:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:43:58):**  New Zealand then that can work I think and if you're a you know a relatively small smaller  
**[0:44:04-0:44:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:44:04):**  artisan type type thing but the scale of farms we're talking about here are quite you know  
**[0:44:09-0:44:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:44:09):**  these are pretty big farms these are 800 cow type farms so the locals have got to drink  
**[0:44:15-0:44:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:44:15):**  a lot of that milk and to make it stay up and also to pay a pretty good price for it  
**[0:44:20-0:44:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:44:20):**  as well so reality is the nature of New Zealand is such that it's always going to be focused  
**[0:44:25-0:44:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:44:25):**  on on the export and you know I think that's important so you're going to be more of a  
**[0:44:30-0:44:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:44:30):**  price taker than than a price giver because yes I mean to an extent with the processor  
**[0:44:38-0:44:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:44:38):**  we are talking and this is more of a now a North Island conversation than South Island  
**[0:44:42-0:44:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:44:42):**  and our focus tends to be South Island but there are some organizations in the North  
**[0:44:47-0:44:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:44:47):**  Island who are looking to capture much more of that value through higher value products  
**[0:44:54-0:44:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:44:54):**  and to get that back to the farmer so we have talked to the process in the South Island  
**[0:44:59-0:45:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:44:59):**  about that and I think there is a degree of appetite around creating a bit of share in  
**[0:45:06-0:45:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:45:06):**  the value that that is available to to high because if you're creating great absolutely  
**[0:45:10-0:45:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:45:10):**  great milk with different protein levels different nutrient levels and much happier cows that  
**[0:45:15-0:45:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:45:15):**  hopefully give much better milk it's almost a shame if that value is taken either by the  
**[0:45:21-0:45:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:45:21):**  processor or then by the marketing company that yeah well if that's the case then that's  
**[0:45:25-0:45:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:45:25):**  the case I mean there's no not too much you can do about it but you see a lot of other  
**[0:45:29-0:45:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:45:29):**  regenerative farmers that at some point maybe they are into grain they start a mill or at  
**[0:45:33-0:45:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:45:33):**  some point they try to capture or they with a few others they start a processor themselves  
**[0:45:40-0:45:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:45:40):**  but I haven't seen anything honestly in dairy on that thing and obviously you have a very  
**[0:45:45-0:45:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:45:45):**  particular logistical situation as you export most of it so there's a difference there but  
**[0:45:51-0:45:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:45:51):**  it you can see that movement in a lot of places but maybe it's too difficult for you at the  
**[0:45:56-0:46:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:45:56):**  moment I do think there's the opportunity to do that and I think we'll probably start  
**[0:46:02-0:46:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:46:02):**  to see that increase because I know that there is capital that is interested in much more  
**[0:46:06-0:46:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:46:06):**  of that vertical integration of that extending through the value chain and not just owning  
**[0:46:12-0:46:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:46:12):**  the say the farming assets and producing the milk but in sort of processing it and then  
**[0:46:18-0:46:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:46:18):**  putting it into supermarkets in Asia or into North America or wherever it might be and  
**[0:46:24-0:46:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:46:24):**  the I mean it's a it's a good thing for us to look to do or to at least capture that  
**[0:46:30-0:46:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:46:30):**  because the the value available through an organic product is you know really really  
**[0:46:36-0:46:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:46:36):**  very very significant there's a lot of margin in there to be to be captured and for farmers  
**[0:46:42-0:46:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:46:42):**  to be rewarded and so that it's a compelling prospect for us to sort of you know work to  
**[0:46:49-0:46:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:46:49):**  just sort of capture more of that.  
**[0:46:52-0:46:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:46:52):**  And in terms of structure this is very very different from the Kiwi structure we discussed  
**[0:46:56-0:47:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:46:56):**  previously this is much bigger opportunity your plan is to buy many farms and to really  
**[0:47:01-0:47:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:47:01):**  build a portfolio which also makes sense for potential institutional investors right that's  
**[0:47:06-0:47:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:47:06):**  the what I read at least through through these slides.  
**[0:47:09-0:47:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:47:09):**  Yeah yeah well look the the opportunity because of market conditions at the moment because  
**[0:47:14-0:47:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:47:14):**  of size of individual farms because of the size of the market is such that you can deploy  
**[0:47:20-0:47:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:47:20):**  a lot of capital and in quite good time into dairying in New Zealand.  
**[0:47:26-0:47:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:47:26):**  I think it's pretty much exclusively into this kind of transformational regenerative  
**[0:47:33-0:47:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:47:33):**  approach I think if you're offshore capital you will struggle to deploy capital into conventional.  
**[0:47:38-0:47:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:47:38):**  Why is that?  
**[0:47:40-0:47:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:47:40):**  The overseas investment office.  
**[0:47:43-0:47:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:47:43):**  They have to basically agree on every investment and they're much more likely to go for this  
**[0:47:47-0:47:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:47:47):**  type?  
**[0:47:48-0:47:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:47:48):**  Yeah it's four hectares and there aren't too many dairy farms in New Zealand smaller than  
**[0:47:51-0:47:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:47:51):**  four hectares so yeah you know and just to give you an idea look we're talking about  
**[0:47:56-0:48:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:47:56):**  as I said 800 cow type farms you know 15 and a half million dollars to buy the farm the  
**[0:48:03-0:48:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:48:03):**  cows and everything else you need so you know these are not small assets but it's quite  
**[0:48:09-0:48:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:48:09):**  a compelling sort of setup the nature of the market because of availability and because  
**[0:48:15-0:48:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:48:15):**  of valuations because of the nature of the organic market and because of some of these  
**[0:48:20-0:48:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:48:20):**  pressures coming on through regulation the aging farmer population the high levels of  
**[0:48:25-0:48:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:48:25):**  debt at the farm gate you know there are a lot of reasons which which make it very interesting  
**[0:48:30-0:48:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:48:30):**  to look at at the moment and as I say from that regenerative if that's your strategy  
**[0:48:36-0:48:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:48:36):**  if that's not your strategy then I think you really need to sort of move on look at other  
**[0:48:40-0:48:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:48:40):**  things or other places but if you're adopting a regenerative approach and it's it's measurable  
**[0:48:47-0:48:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:48:47):**  and articulate and articulated and one that is genuinely inclusive with stakeholders in  
**[0:48:55-0:49:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:48:55):**  those catchments and then I think it becomes far more plausible or it becomes an executable  
**[0:49:02-0:49:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:49:02):**  sort of strategy as opposed to one that is at its time.  
**[0:49:05-0:49:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:49:05):**  I think it's interesting as it's such a specific case it's mostly export and it seems to be  
**[0:49:11-0:49:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:49:11):**  mostly potential investments coming from overseas so it's a very particular case when you look  
**[0:49:18-0:49:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:49:18):**  at the global agriculture market and that makes it but you've always had that interaction  
**[0:49:23-0:49:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:49:23):**  it's always been for export and I think lots of the money I think we had a discussion previously  
**[0:49:28-0:49:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:49:28):**  as well and the local impact investing sector which doesn't really exist yet or starting  
**[0:49:32-0:49:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:49:32):**  to emerge but it's mostly Australia mostly further away and that's actually how we got  
**[0:49:37-0:49:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:49:37):**  connected as well so that's very interesting.  
**[0:49:39-0:49:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:49:39):**  New Zealand is small you know there's four million people four and a half million people  
**[0:49:45-0:49:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:49:45):**  and so that means there's a small number of large investors very small the capital isn't  
**[0:49:52-0:49:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:49:52):**  that big so to rely on on domestic capital alone to drive impact type outcomes it's starting  
**[0:49:58-0:50:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:49:58):**  at a small level to happen that's for sure but relative to offshore capital then well  
**[0:50:03-0:50:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:50:03):**  there's no comparison.  
**[0:50:04-0:50:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:50:04):**  So yeah so I stopped the sharing and I would like to end with a final question I see that  
**[0:50:10-0:50:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:50:10):**  actually time has flown okay if you could wave your your magic wand and tomorrow morning  
**[0:50:15-0:50:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:50:15):**  we wake up or in a few hours because in your case it's already evening what would you like  
**[0:50:19-0:50:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:50:19):**  to change in the ag or regenerative ag and the impact investing space what would be your  
**[0:50:26-0:50:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:50:26):**  point to that what would wake up tomorrow and think ah Jeff changed something.  
**[0:50:30-0:50:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:50:30):**  Yeah I would like to see a lot more capital being deployed into the regenerative ag sector  
**[0:50:38-0:50:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:50:38):**  and into making change happen because there is a lot of discussion about this there's  
**[0:50:45-0:50:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:50:45):**  a lot of ESG reports produced there's a lot of even media coverage but in terms of the  
**[0:50:52-0:50:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:50:52):**  actual activity on the ground I mean I think I literally know all the regenerative ag investment  
**[0:50:59-0:51:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:50:59):**  guys in the Western world and I could probably have them over for a dinner party you know  
**[0:51:04-0:51:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:51:04):**  there might be one I'm missing out or two but you know two or three of those four of  
**[0:51:08-0:51:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:51:08):**  those guys and that's about all there is you know I know them extremely well they're all  
**[0:51:12-0:51:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:51:12):**  great guys yeah all girls of course yeah the ones I know all actually are guys but there  
**[0:51:18-0:51:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:51:18):**  might be girls out there as well.  
**[0:51:19-0:51:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:51:19):**  Which is an issue on my show I have to be honest yeah I want much more gender diversity  
**[0:51:23-0:51:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:51:23):**  because in the impact investing space it's much more balanced but somehow when as soon  
**[0:51:28-0:51:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:51:28):**  as you get to agriculture it loses that gender balance completely which is really annoying  
**[0:51:33-0:51:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:51:33):**  so anybody listening or watching and knows any great people to interview please think  
**[0:51:38-0:51:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:51:38):**  about gender balance because I need that much better so if you scroll down on the soundcloud  
**[0:51:43-0:51:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:51:43):**  list it's it's quite embarrassing actually but so you would change that but how would  
**[0:51:47-0:51:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:51:47):**  you do that what would be the main.  
**[0:51:49-0:51:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:51:49):**  As I say this is money going into traditional conventional agriculture that is is part of  
**[0:51:56-0:52:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:51:56):**  the problem not part of the solution and where there's some very capable people doing great  
**[0:52:01-0:52:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:52:01):**  things in the regenerative space and it would be good to see those guys being rewarded for  
**[0:52:06-0:52:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:52:06):**  their their vision and their passion and their ability to to make you know change happen.  
**[0:52:13-0:52:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:52:13):**  And what do you think is the how could we do that I mean the magic wand is probably  
**[0:52:17-0:52:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:52:17):**  not going to work I'm sorry to to to bust that bubble but how would be what would be  
**[0:52:22-0:52:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:52:22):**  one thing to wake up investors for soil or to even maybe the other part to to see the  
**[0:52:29-0:52:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:52:29):**  risks they're putting to work now while while they're investing in conventional chemical  
**[0:52:33-0:52:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:52:33):**  agriculture what would you think is the main leverage point we have.  
**[0:52:39-0:52:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:52:39):**  Well yeah that's a lot of our yeah yeah days and I think all you can do is is talk to to  
**[0:52:49-0:52:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:52:49):**  facts to what you know to describe the sort of the situation and then you need to find  
**[0:52:55-0:53:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:52:55):**  that the right people so you need to find the people who will be willing to support  
**[0:53:00-0:53:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:53:00):**  that and to whom it is important to support and I think that's increasing I think so particularly  
**[0:53:05-0:53:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:53:05):**  out of northern Europe or say out of families who are getting that generational change these  
**[0:53:12-0:53:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:53:12):**  types of things are becoming important and so they become less of a nice to have and  
**[0:53:18-0:53:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:53:18):**  more of an essential to have and I think that's I'm hoping that's where we'll start to see  
**[0:53:24-0:53:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:53:24):**  some sort of change being driven through through that process but but otherwise it's you know  
**[0:53:31-0:53:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:53:31):**  it is challenging it becomes a case of you know articulating the story over and over  
**[0:53:37-0:53:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:53:37):**  again finding people who understand it you know and who have a have a desire to pursue  
**[0:53:44-0:53:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:53:44):**  it whether that desire is based on motivation around wanting to drive environmental change  
**[0:53:50-0:53:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:53:50):**  or whether it's just recognition that hey this is a really good idea and there's this  
**[0:53:53-0:53:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:53:53):**  big trend sort of moving this way in the world anyway so we might as well get on board because  
**[0:53:58-0:54:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:53:58):**  we could make some money you know my view is if people want to pursue it because they  
**[0:54:01-0:54:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:54:01):**  just want to make money well that's great because it's still doing the right thing and  
**[0:54:05-0:54:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:54:05):**  I hope that they then like the all the other sort of stuff as well but yeah I just you  
**[0:54:09-0:54:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:54:09):**  know those are the kinds of things that I think are driving the change well that's what  
**[0:54:14-0:54:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:54:14):**  we need to see more of yeah I completely agree it's a it really goes against many things  
**[0:54:21-0:54:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:54:21):**  that we we've learned and seen in agriculture and and to question that or saying we can  
**[0:54:26-0:54:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:54:26):**  go much further than that is really difficult for people to get into their head now I've  
**[0:54:31-0:54:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:54:31):**  seen an organic farm and the farmers really struggling so I know that organic farmers  
**[0:54:35-0:54:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:54:35):**  are struggling and and we're never going to feed the world with that it's like yeah but  
**[0:54:39-0:54:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:54:39):**  I've seen others and so that's a that's it's a very very difficult narrative to get through  
**[0:54:44-0:54:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:54:44):**  but the narrative is very strong and very good and I think with with the regulations  
**[0:54:48-0:54:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:54:48):**  that are happening it's a very interesting point in New Zealand that the outside pressure  
**[0:54:51-0:54:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:54:51):**  is going to be stronger and there is a huge pull factor because the export market is is  
**[0:54:55-0:55:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:54:55):**  so interested in this stuff so that that hopefully it's like an inflection point so I want to  
**[0:55:00-0:55:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:55:00):**  thank you so much for your time it was great to learn more on New Zealand more on kiwifruits  
**[0:55:05-0:55:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:55:05):**  that I never knew before more on on dairy and and of course to see like quite a particular  
**[0:55:11-0:55:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:55:11):**  but very interesting agriculture situation and impact investing situation where both  
**[0:55:14-0:55:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:55:14):**  the export is the key driver but also the import or the investment coming from overseas  
**[0:55:20-0:55:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:55:20):**  so you have those two pulling points basically working together so it's a it was great spending  
**[0:55:25-0:55:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:55:25):**  your evening thank you so much for taking the time this Monday evening and I hope to  
**[0:55:30-0:55:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:55:30):**  check in with you soon again and learn much more on other projects you're working on great  
**[0:55:35-0:55:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:55:35):**  well it's been a pleasure talking with you current and so nice to catch up and I hope  
**[0:55:39-0:55:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:55:39):**  to speak again soon and thank you for being part of this experiment so yeah it's been  
**[0:55:44-0:55:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:55:44):**  great loved it enjoyed it a lot thank you so much for listening all the way till the

**[0:56:50-0:56:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:56:50):**  investing in regenerative agriculture and food how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[0:56:55-0:56:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:56:55):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it why are we doing this  
**[0:56:59-0:57:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:56:59):**  course after a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of audio asking the question  
**[0:57:04-0:57:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:57:04):**  how to put money to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011  
**[0:57:09-0:57:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:57:09):**  and recording these podcasts since 2016 we thought it was time to share our lessons learned  
**[0:57:14-0:57:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:57:14):**  what have we seen in the space over the last years how have we built our decision-making  
**[0:57:18-0:57:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/#t=0:57:18):**  framework what to focus on with the podcast how have we picked interviewees and what questions

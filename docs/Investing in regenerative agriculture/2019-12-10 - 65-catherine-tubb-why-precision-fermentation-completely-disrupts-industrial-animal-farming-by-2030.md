**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:00:14):**  Disrupting the Cow  
**[0:00:15-0:00:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:00:15):**  This interview is about how factory farms, agriculture and land prices will be disrupted  
**[0:00:20-0:00:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:00:20):**  by precision fermentation.  
**[0:00:24-0:00:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:00:24):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture.  
**[0:00:28-0:00:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:00:28):**  Talking as if the planet mattered, a podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative  
**[0:00:32-0:00:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:00:32):**  food and agriculture space to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate  
**[0:00:37-0:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:00:37):**  soil, people, local communities and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:00:44):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:46-0:00:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:00:46):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:00:50-0:00:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:00:50):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:00:52-0:00:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:00:52):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:00:57-0:01:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:00:57):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:02-0:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:01:02):**  Before we get started, I've been recording these interviews next to my day job and I  
**[0:01:06-0:01:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:01:06):**  will definitely continue to do so and release about an episode a month.  
**[0:01:10-0:01:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:01:10):**  But at the same time I would love to take this further, share more interviews, there  
**[0:01:14-0:01:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:01:14):**  are many more stories to share on investing in regenerative food and agriculture.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:01:18):**  More depth, improve the quality, maybe even doing some video series.  
**[0:01:23-0:01:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:01:23):**  So I started a Patreon community which makes it easy to support creators like myself.  
**[0:01:27-0:01:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:01:27):**  If these podcasts have been of value to you and if you have the means, I invite you to  
**[0:01:32-0:01:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:01:32):**  support me and make this happen.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:01:34):**  For more information, please find the link to my Patreon account in the description below.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:01:39):**  And now, without further ado, the interview.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:01:43):**  Enjoy!  
**[0:01:44-0:01:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:01:44):**  Welcome to another episode of this podcast.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:01:46):**  Today I'm joined by Catherine Tubb of RethinkX, the lead author of Rethinking Food and Agriculture  
**[0:01:51-0:01:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:01:51):**  2020-2030, the second domestication of plants and animals, the disruption of the cow and  
**[0:01:57-0:01:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:01:57):**  the collapse of the industrial livestock farming.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:01:59):**  Welcome Catherine.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:02:00):**  Hi Koen.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:02:01):**  So, a personal question.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:02:03):**  What brings you to the space and what brings you to ag and food?  
**[0:02:06-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:02:06):**  So after my PhD I actually ended up in finance looking mainly at the kind of fertiliser,  
**[0:02:12-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:02:12):**  crop protection chemicals and seed companies.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:02:15):**  And part of that work we looked at the global trends.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:02:17):**  A very fun space.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:02:18):**  Yeah.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:02:19):**  Well, yeah.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:02:20):**  It is fun but probably not for the reasons.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:02:24):**  And just kind of the feed that we're looking at many things, including the feed the world  
**[0:02:27-0:02:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:02:27):**  theme.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:02:28):**  And I just got really interested in the whole agriculture space there, mainly really from  
**[0:02:32-0:02:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:02:32):**  a data point of view.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:02:34):**  It felt a very opaque industry.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:02:36):**  So after I kind of moved on in my firm, I was always mainly kind of this interest in  
**[0:02:42-0:02:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:02:42):**  the agricultural space.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:02:43):**  But the job came up at RethinkX and I really felt it kind of married my interest in the  
**[0:02:48-0:02:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:02:48):**  agriculture space along with a kind of data-driven approach to that.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:02:52):**  And then also perhaps doing something, scratching the itch to do something that I had with a  
**[0:02:56-0:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:02:56):**  bit more impact as well.  
**[0:02:58-0:02:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:02:58):**  Yeah.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:02:59):**  I mean, can you, for whoever didn't read the report yet, I definitely encourage you to  
**[0:03:03-0:03:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:03:03):**  do so.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:03:04):**  I will link all the links to the report, which is freely online available.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:03:09):**  Disrupting the Cow, a subtitle I think is enough to make you read it.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:03:12):**  But can you give us a short overview of what you mean with precision fermentation and how  
**[0:03:17-0:03:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:03:17):**  that is going to disrupt in the next decade basically, because we're almost in 2020.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:03:22):**  Especially as you focus on the US and the factory farming industry.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:03:25):**  Yeah.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:03:26):**  So our report looks at how technology is going to converge and basically become cheap enough  
**[0:03:31-0:03:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:03:31):**  and good enough to transform how we produce protein.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:03:34):**  So this report is really about a protein disruption driven by economics.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:03:39):**  And essentially we're going to be able to produce the same proteins found today in livestock  
**[0:03:42-0:03:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:03:42):**  by a method we call precision fermentation.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:03:46):**  And by 2025, this technology will be able to compete cost-wise with bulk proteins.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:03:51):**  And this is the point where adoption is going to be a tip and accelerate exponentially and  
**[0:03:56-0:03:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:03:56):**  all that time cost are going to continue to improve.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:03:59):**  And ultimately we see proteins as being five times cheaper by 2030 than existing animal  
**[0:04:03-0:04:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:04:03):**  proteins.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:04:04):**  And I guess the other point is not a single disruption, but multiple parallel disruptions  
**[0:04:09-0:04:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:04:09):**  across every single part of the cow from the milk, the meat, the leather, the collagen.  
**[0:04:14-0:04:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:04:14):**  And these are all going to impact each other.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:04:16):**  And it doesn't depend on a kind of one-for-one substitution of the end product.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:04:19):**  This is an ingredient business to business led disruption.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:04:22):**  Yeah, because I think that's an absolutely crucial point that it's not disrupting the  
**[0:04:28-0:04:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:04:28):**  cow as a whole.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:04:29):**  It's very similar to a report Ritin wrote before about oil.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:04:32):**  It's looking at all the different parts and which one is going first and probably taking  
**[0:04:36-0:04:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:04:36):**  away the business model actually for most cow farming as it is very, very thin margins.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:04:41):**  Can you explain a bit more about how that whole picture works in terms when we look  
**[0:04:45-0:04:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:04:45):**  at a cow and how it's being processed today and how that might be partly replaced as in  
**[0:04:51-0:04:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:04:51):**  a roadmap over the next five to 10 years?  
**[0:04:53-0:04:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:04:53):**  Yeah, so the best example of this is really milk.  
**[0:04:56-0:05:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:04:56):**  So if you think about if you take milk from a cow, only 3.3% of it is the protein.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:05:01):**  And I think another couple of percent is the fat.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:05:04):**  And if you think about how milk is actually used globally, a lot of the milk is actually  
**[0:05:08-0:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:05:08):**  kind of put down into the solids, the milk solids, and that's what's exported.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:05:12):**  So for example, New Zealand exports 70% of their milk as these solid exports.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:05:17):**  If you can make that at the same cost anywhere in the world, that's going to completely obliterate  
**[0:05:24-0:05:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:05:24):**  New Zealand's export milk industry and therefore obliterate their dairy industry.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:05:29):**  And that's going to obviously have huge knock-on effects.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:05:31):**  And once you take out the dairy industry, you take out kind of cheap meat and that's  
**[0:05:35-0:05:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:05:35):**  going to increase prices in the meat.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:05:37):**  And then that's going to kind of drive investment and into the further kind of PF for precision  
**[0:05:43-0:05:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:05:43):**  fermentation for meat.  
**[0:05:45-0:05:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:05:45):**  Then that's going to kind of basically disrupt the whole cow.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:05:48):**  So this is what we mean when it's not this one for one disruption.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:05:50):**  You don't have to be able to make like the same amount of meat or the same amount of  
**[0:05:54-0:05:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:05:54):**  milk.  
**[0:05:55-0:05:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:05:55):**  You can just make those parts.  
**[0:05:56-0:05:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:05:56):**  We call it a food software model.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:05:58):**  So you're just building up from the bottom of our food system, essentially.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:06:03):**  It seems a very fragile system and almost a domino effect.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:06:07):**  Like if you take out one and the whole thing will very quickly, because that's what you're  
**[0:06:12-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:06:12):**  writing about, the disruption will very quickly collapse.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:06:15):**  Exactly.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:06:16):**  So I mean, particularly the cow industry is very on very, very thin margins, as I'm sure  
**[0:06:22-0:06:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:06:22):**  people are aware, there's a lot of subsidies going on.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:06:25):**  So it's kind of very knife edge industry and that makes it very kind of susceptible to  
**[0:06:30-0:06:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:06:30):**  disruption.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:06:31):**  And that's something we've looked at, as you mentioned in our previous report.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:06:34):**  And this is kind of our bread and butter.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:06:35):**  This is what we look at.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:06:36):**  We look at disruptions, technology driven disruptions.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:06:38):**  So this is something we feel particularly confident about.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:06:42):**  And can you describe, because for sure a few people now think, OK, what is this PF precision  
**[0:06:46-0:06:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:06:46):**  fermentation?  
**[0:06:47-0:06:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:06:47):**  What is it exactly?  
**[0:06:48-0:06:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:06:48):**  How should I imagine a factory looking like?  
**[0:06:52-0:06:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:06:52):**  How should I imagine these proteins being created?  
**[0:06:56-0:07:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:06:56):**  So precision fermentation is when you take microbes and basically kind of program them  
**[0:07:00-0:07:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:07:00):**  to produce anything you want, mainly proteins, right?  
**[0:07:04-0:07:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:07:04):**  So things like yeast, fungi, you'll be able to just program just as we do its fermentation,  
**[0:07:09-0:07:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:07:09):**  just as you do to make beer or sugar or kimchi or ketchup or wine or yogurt.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:07:15):**  You know, you're going to harness these microbes to be able to make any protein you want.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:07:19):**  So if you imagine a farm, it could look very like a kind of local craft brewery with lots  
**[0:07:24-0:07:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:07:24):**  of tanks going on, making these proteins that are going to be used.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:07:29):**  So of course, it could be anywhere in the world, right?  
**[0:07:32-0:07:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:07:32):**  You're not limited to kind of this centralized production system.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:07:36):**  These tanks could be in your back garden or in the car park of a supermarket.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:07:40):**  You know, it could be anywhere on a rooftop.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:07:42):**  And what does it use as feed?  
**[0:07:44-0:07:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:07:44):**  Because these microbes need to eat.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:07:46):**  So what do we need to feed them, basically, to create these proteins?  
**[0:07:50-0:07:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:07:50):**  It's mainly sugar and then nitrogen.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:07:52):**  Sugar from anything, we eventually think that they'll be able to get carbohydrates from  
**[0:07:57-0:07:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:07:57):**  kind of biomatter.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:07:59):**  So even leaves or household waste in the end.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:08:03):**  But you just need a lot less of it than you do currently with the current livestock system.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:08:07):**  So if the livestock, if you imagine a cow, it's like a 25 to 1 roughly.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:08:11):**  I mean, you hear any 4% feed efficient cows, whereas if you're going to a 1 to 1 feed efficiency,  
**[0:08:17-0:08:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:08:17):**  it's just a lot less feed you're going to need.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:08:20):**  And does the quality of the sugar of the material, because I think for now it will be mostly  
**[0:08:25-0:08:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:08:25):**  sugar, does that influence the outcome of the protein?  
**[0:08:29-0:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:08:29):**  Is it, as in software, I mean, you say software as a service, like garbage in, garbage out.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:08:34):**  What does that do to the microbe if you're feeding X type of sugar or is there, what's  
**[0:08:40-0:08:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:08:40):**  happening in that space?  
**[0:08:41-0:08:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:08:41):**  It's a bit like a car, I guess, depending on if you're using the right fuel, but it  
**[0:08:46-0:08:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:08:46):**  depends on what the car wants to use.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:08:48):**  I mean, if you put petrol in a diesel car, it's not going to work.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:08:51):**  If you put diesel in a diesel car, it is.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:08:53):**  So it depends on how the microbe is tuned to take the input.  
**[0:08:56-0:08:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:08:56):**  And that's something that you can also program.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:08:58):**  So you're not just programming the outputs, but you can program the kind of inputs needed  
**[0:09:02-0:09:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:09:02):**  as well.  
**[0:09:03-0:09:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:09:03):**  So yeah, I mean, I know a lot of microbes at the moment like to kind of bathe in the  
**[0:09:08-0:09:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:09:08):**  best possible sugar, the purest glucose, but that can change.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:09:11):**  It's just an efficiency question and a programmable question.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:09:14):**  And the big question on health, like what comes out of this process?  
**[0:09:19-0:09:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:09:19):**  I think we all know the incredible health issues of the industrial factory farming system  
**[0:09:26-0:09:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:09:26):**  and what comes out of that.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:09:27):**  I don't think we can even call it meat, but what comes out of this, probably it will be  
**[0:09:31-0:09:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:09:31):**  a big fight if we can actually call it legally meat.  
**[0:09:33-0:09:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:09:33):**  I mean, that's for a separate discussion, but in terms of health, what do you see where  
**[0:09:38-0:09:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:09:38):**  we're now and where we're like in five years compared to the meat products you can now  
**[0:09:42-0:09:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:09:42):**  buy in the supermarket or the protein products?  
**[0:09:45-0:09:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:09:45):**  Because it could be milk as you said before.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:09:47):**  I mean, I think there's a disease and nutrition question on health.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:09:50):**  So disease, obviously you're not going to have those kind of issues that you get with  
**[0:09:53-0:09:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:09:53):**  factory farming and then the slaughterhouses where you get a lot of contamination of the  
**[0:09:57-0:09:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:09:57):**  food.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:09:58):**  So they've done some tests, I think, on the meat produced via kind of, which is slightly  
**[0:10:04-0:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:10:04):**  different to precision fermentation, but if you can produce meat, it usually doesn't get  
**[0:10:07-0:10:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:10:07):**  the same bacteria and microbes that you have an issue with.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:10:10):**  But then on the nutrition side, obviously there is a bigger kind of question and people  
**[0:10:15-0:10:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:10:15):**  are still looking into that a lot.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:10:16):**  But on nutrition, I think the ability to kind of build up the products, you know, very personalizable  
**[0:10:22-0:10:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:10:22):**  nutrition questions that you need, like based on the particular proteins that you may or  
**[0:10:27-0:10:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:10:27):**  may not need, it's going to be extremely valuable.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:10:30):**  You know, we definitely say that it's going to be better because you're just not going  
**[0:10:33-0:10:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:10:33):**  to have that contamination that you get in the current system.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:10:37):**  But is it safe to say that, let's say on the nutrition side of things, there's still, at  
**[0:10:41-0:10:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:10:41):**  least I see that in the say the regular ag and food space, there's still a lot of unknowns  
**[0:10:45-0:10:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:10:45):**  on what actually is nutrition and what nurtures us and where that actually comes from.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:10:51):**  Is that figured out already in precision fermentation?  
**[0:10:53-0:10:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:10:53):**  Well, you're just producing the same protein.  
**[0:10:57-0:11:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:10:57):**  So that could be a plant based protein or an animal based protein.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:11:00):**  So for example, the impossible burger uses this technology to make heme, but it's heme  
**[0:11:04-0:11:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:11:04):**  from a soy plant.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:11:05):**  So you could do it to make any kind of protein, right?  
**[0:11:08-0:11:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:11:08):**  So I think the ability to make these pure proteins would enable us to understand much  
**[0:11:12-0:11:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:11:12):**  better the impact that they're going to have on us.  
**[0:11:14-0:11:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:11:14):**  But I wouldn't, yeah, I would definitely agree with you that obviously still a lot of questions  
**[0:11:18-0:11:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:11:18):**  about nutrition.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:11:19):**  We're not necessarily trying to answer that here.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:11:21):**  We're just saying if you can make any protein cheaper than people generally, that's generally  
**[0:11:26-0:11:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:11:26):**  how people choose their food, right?  
**[0:11:27-0:11:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:11:27):**  It's actually based on taste, cost and convenience.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:11:31):**  Nutrition is becoming increasingly important to people, but that's not the main driver.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:11:35):**  And you mentioned a few times in the report actually hormones.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:11:38):**  I mean, we know the hormone story on the CAFO side of things.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:11:43):**  How is that in precision fermentation?  
**[0:11:45-0:11:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:11:45):**  I want to keep saying precision farming because I see the F. It's actually precision fermentation.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:11:50):**  I'm going to mess up a few times in this podcast probably.  
**[0:11:53-0:11:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:11:53):**  Yeah.  
**[0:11:54-0:11:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:11:54):**  I mean, you're not going to need any hormone inputs, right?  
**[0:11:56-0:12:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:11:56):**  This is going to be a closed system telling the yeast, giving them sugar to produce a  
**[0:12:00-0:12:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:12:00):**  protein.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:12:01):**  There is no other kind of impacts how you then use that protein, whether it's to make  
**[0:12:05-0:12:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:12:05):**  meat further on or, you know, to make up a kind of plant plus, you know, precision fermentation  
**[0:12:11-0:12:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:12:11):**  burger food or milk wouldn't have any hormones in.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:12:13):**  You're just not going to have those excess hormones at all.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:12:17):**  So I think that's an incredibly that on the nutrition or health side, that's obviously  
**[0:12:21-0:12:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:12:21):**  a really good benefit.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:12:24):**  And I mean, you mentioned you could have these plans or these fermentation fats basically  
**[0:12:29-0:12:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:12:29):**  anywhere like microbreweries, et cetera.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:12:32):**  How do we prevent that?  
**[0:12:35-0:12:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:12:35):**  We have the same kind of concentration because they sound like quite big investments in terms  
**[0:12:41-0:12:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:12:41):**  of infrastructure, especially at the beginning.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:12:43):**  Of course, prices will come down.  
**[0:12:44-0:12:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:12:44):**  But to really build up this huge fermentation industry that will give us a lot of animal  
**[0:12:49-0:12:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:12:49):**  protein.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:12:50):**  How do we prevent this enormous concentration that we have now, especially in the KFO industry  
**[0:12:55-0:12:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:12:55):**  in the US, where I think there are just a few producing all pork and just a few producing  
**[0:12:59-0:13:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:12:59):**  all chickens and actually mostly the same companies and also in the beef industry, there's  
**[0:13:03-0:13:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:13:03):**  an enormous concentration.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:13:04):**  Is there anything to say on that as a potential danger and what this movement could do for  
**[0:13:09-0:13:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:13:09):**  that?  
**[0:13:10-0:13:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:13:10):**  Yeah.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:13:11):**  So this is really part of the point of our report.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:13:12):**  We want to kind of alert people that there are going to be choices to be made with this  
**[0:13:16-0:13:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:13:16):**  technology disruption.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:13:17):**  And we really kind of advocate to ensure an open and transparent competitive market, because  
**[0:13:23-0:13:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:13:23):**  we think that's critical to ensure competition.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:13:26):**  And they're going to be kind of key choices to be made around IP to prevent that oligopoly  
**[0:13:30-0:13:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:13:30):**  type structure.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:13:31):**  So I think the food or software model being distributed is kind of aligned a little bit  
**[0:13:37-0:13:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:13:37):**  with meaning you're not going to necessarily see those big kind of oligopolies because  
**[0:13:41-0:13:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:13:41):**  the molecule development, microorganism design, distribution and food production is much closer  
**[0:13:45-0:13:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:13:45):**  to kind of craft brewing industry.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:13:48):**  And then because it's distributed, it means it's going to be very hard for any one company  
**[0:13:51-0:13:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:13:51):**  to kind of dominate and difficult for those companies kind of providing a lesser quality  
**[0:13:56-0:13:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:13:56):**  product to succeed as well.  
**[0:13:57-0:14:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:13:57):**  So you get the kind of the benefit of the distribution also adding to kind of higher  
**[0:14:01-0:14:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:14:01):**  quality.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:14:02):**  So really we advocate to allow companies patent production, but not of life or genes or molecules,  
**[0:14:08-0:14:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:14:08):**  but perhaps around process rather than output focused.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:14:12):**  And then also avoid following the pharmaceutical model where, you know, hopefully it should  
**[0:14:17-0:14:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:14:17):**  actually be the cost of the product development is much lower than pharmaceuticals as well.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:14:21):**  And then just kind of supporting globally this creation, an open source, transparent  
**[0:14:26-0:14:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:14:26):**  collaborative network, which should be international to really just accelerate the pace of development.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:14:31):**  But you're right, there are a lot of questions and things to put in place that we do avoid  
**[0:14:35-0:14:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:14:35):**  that big oligopoly structure.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:14:37):**  Yeah, because it tends to go there, unfortunately, even with now microbreweries being bought  
**[0:14:42-0:14:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:14:42):**  up by the big ones that see that there's their margins and the market is changing there.  
**[0:14:47-0:14:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:14:47):**  But at least for a while, it was very and it is still very distributed.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:14:50):**  And I mean, if they can get into protein at some point and the fermentation isn't so hard  
**[0:14:55-0:14:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:14:55):**  and difficult to control, which I don't know, it should hopefully prevent that.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:14:59):**  But it's going to I mean, it's it's also a plea for governments to get involved and set  
**[0:15:04-0:15:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:15:04):**  certain structures and rules around this, because otherwise it will follow the model  
**[0:15:09-0:15:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:15:09):**  we've unfortunately seen before.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:15:10):**  Yeah, I mean, I think you're always going to have big food companies in play because  
**[0:15:15-0:15:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:15:15):**  they are they do have those kind of networks and distribution now.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:15:18):**  And if say a Leslie or someone decided to take this technology and integrate it into  
**[0:15:23-0:15:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:15:23):**  their system, they would kind of be a good place to do it.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:15:27):**  But it may well, you know, they could then take it all in house, but equally, they may  
**[0:15:30-0:15:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:15:30):**  say, actually, we're just going to go to localised production and perhaps the production becomes,  
**[0:15:34-0:15:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:15:34):**  you know, not a few farms, it's actually done locally and closer to where Nestle's customers  
**[0:15:40-0:15:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:15:40):**  are, for example.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:15:41):**  So you're kind of wiping out all that distribution that you need.  
**[0:15:44-0:15:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:15:44):**  So I mean, there are a few models that could happen and it will depend a lot on the incumbents  
**[0:15:48-0:15:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:15:48):**  and how they act as much as how these new companies come along as well.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:15:53):**  Yeah, and if you would name like one or two examples that surprised you most in a report  
**[0:15:59-0:16:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:15:59):**  or something that came out that was actually closer to our food shelves than maybe five  
**[0:16:04-0:16:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:16:04):**  to 10 years.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:16:05):**  And what would you say?  
**[0:16:06-0:16:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:16:06):**  I mean, I've wanted I got which was very interesting, but I'm curious about how close are we actually  
**[0:16:12-0:16:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:16:12):**  already to this and what surprised you in that?  
**[0:16:14-0:16:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:16:14):**  I mean, this is already here, right?  
**[0:16:17-0:16:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:16:17):**  I mean, possible have already producing these products.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:16:20):**  I think I'm most excited about some of the products because we're kind of in terms of  
**[0:16:26-0:16:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:16:26):**  the cost curve, just really on the cusp of becoming really cost competitive with bulk  
**[0:16:29-0:16:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:16:29):**  proteins.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:16:30):**  But the ones I'm really excited about, I think are kind of driving forward and more actually  
**[0:16:34-0:16:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:16:34):**  in the material space and the guilt or make collagen for use in cosmetics.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:16:40):**  And apparently, it actually can reverse some damage because you're making human collagen.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:16:45):**  You're not making pig or cow collagen or using marine collagen.  
**[0:16:50-0:16:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:16:50):**  So you're actually making it's a very good example because you're making something that's  
**[0:16:53-0:16:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:16:53):**  better, right?  
**[0:16:54-0:16:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:16:54):**  You're making something that we should be putting on our faces.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:16:57):**  And they've actually just signed, I think, in the last month, a couple of weeks, assigned  
**[0:17:00-0:17:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:17:00):**  an agreement to make gelatin, which is collagen's kind of one step on which is used, obviously,  
**[0:17:06-0:17:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:17:06):**  in a lot of kind of food, sweet supplements.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:17:09):**  So that's amazing.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:17:10):**  Essentially, you can make it.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:17:11):**  And obviously, there are a lot of kind of gelatin like products that people use to mimic  
**[0:17:16-0:17:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:17:16):**  gelatin and using the kind of vegetarian and vegan food space.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:17:19):**  But if you can actually make pure gelatin and then whether it's human gelatin or some  
**[0:17:23-0:17:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:17:23):**  other gelatin, you're making the best protein that we could be consuming.  
**[0:17:28-0:17:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:17:28):**  So I think that to me is like a sign that it's starting to really become competitive.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:17:32):**  You've seen also companies making spider silk, which is also a protein, and they're making  
**[0:17:36-0:17:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:17:36):**  it spy, but it's called a Japanese company.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:17:38):**  And they make it into material, right?  
**[0:17:40-0:17:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:17:40):**  So it's not just in food.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:17:42):**  You're seeing these kind of developments that are really on the market.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:17:44):**  And that's just one order of magnitude away in terms of the cost.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:17:48):**  So I think once you've seen those companies, which you are already with Geltol and gelatin,  
**[0:17:52-0:17:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:17:52):**  moving into the food space, that's when it becomes really exciting.  
**[0:17:55-0:17:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:17:55):**  Because obviously, you've got to fall down that value cost curve.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:17:57):**  And with food, it's quite difficult because meat is really very, very cheap.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:18:01):**  We're very, I don't know, lucky.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:18:02):**  I don't know if that's the right word.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:18:04):**  And the whole movement has been towards making cheap meat.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:18:08):**  So it's quite hard to break into.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:18:09):**  So I think once we start seeing these products being produced, and really breaking into specific  
**[0:18:15-0:18:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:18:15):**  areas of the market, I think that's when it becomes really exciting.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:18:19):**  You're basically unpacking the cow or the products coming out of the cow and taking  
**[0:18:23-0:18:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:18:23):**  obviously the most interesting ones first.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:18:25):**  And that's not the meat part.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:18:28):**  And another exciting, well, another interesting example, which I probably find is another  
**[0:18:32-0:18:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:18:32):**  more than anyone, is the fact that the idea that for formula milk for babies, instead  
**[0:18:36-0:18:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:18:36):**  of using cow proteins, you could use human proteins, which might sound a little bit icky,  
**[0:18:41-0:18:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:18:41):**  I guess, in some ways.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:18:42):**  But if you had the choice, and everyone has a choice of how they feed their baby, but  
**[0:18:46-0:18:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:18:46):**  if you decided to feed them formula milk, would you prefer them to have formula milk  
**[0:18:50-0:18:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:18:50):**  with human proteins or cow proteins?  
**[0:18:53-0:18:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:18:53):**  Would you like it to be more personalized to your baby or the other way around?  
**[0:18:56-0:19:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:18:56):**  So I think there's interesting levels where actually you can offer something better for  
**[0:19:00-0:19:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:19:00):**  people, a superior protein product for people.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:19:03):**  Yeah, and I was actually, I mean, that raises a lot of interesting questions, which we can  
**[0:19:09-0:19:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:19:09):**  probably fill a whole podcast on that.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:19:11):**  And I will for sure get responses.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:19:13):**  But that's for another time, dear listeners.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:19:16):**  Another one I was actually surprised by was palm oil.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:19:20):**  Like it can already be produced via PF at a lower cost than pre-produced palm oil.  
**[0:19:25-0:19:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:19:25):**  Can you expand a bit on that?  
**[0:19:27-0:19:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:19:27):**  Because that would revolutionize, especially deforestation rates that are just going up  
**[0:19:31-0:19:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:19:31):**  basically.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:19:32):**  Yeah, so I mean, I'm not just limited to proteins.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:19:35):**  You can make other products.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:19:37):**  And one of them is palm oil.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:19:38):**  There's actually a guy in Bath in the UK working on that.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:19:41):**  I don't know if it's actually at lower cost yet.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:19:44):**  That's not something I'm aware of.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:19:46):**  But you know, the idea that you're not limited to just protein, it's any molecule, right?  
**[0:19:50-0:19:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:19:50):**  So it's really harnessing these microbes, the full abilities of what they can do and  
**[0:19:54-0:19:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:19:54):**  what they can make.  
**[0:19:55-0:19:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:19:55):**  So I mean, you can make anything, pretty much any molecule.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:19:59):**  I mean, obviously the ones that you make at the moment, a lot of biological drugs are  
**[0:20:04-0:20:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:20:04):**  made this way.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:20:05):**  But as we go down the cost curve, it's going to really open up kind of smaller molecules  
**[0:20:09-0:20:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:20:09):**  as well.  
**[0:20:10-0:20:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:20:10):**  So protein is probably the next level, I would say.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:20:12):**  You know, you're not going to make necessary commodity chemicals like this until the cost  
**[0:20:17-0:20:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:20:17):**  really comes down.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:20:18):**  But yeah, anything.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:20:19):**  Like vanilla, there's just been an assigned agreement with a company that are making vanilla.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:20:24):**  So there's a big, I don't know how much you know about vanilla, but actually 99% of vanilla  
**[0:20:28-0:20:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:20:28):**  is not made, is not natural in inverted commas.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:20:32):**  It's actually made from wood or oil, but it's not quite vanilla, vanilla is the actual kind  
**[0:20:38-0:20:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:20:38):**  of molecule.  
**[0:20:39-0:20:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:20:39):**  But yeah, exactly.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:20:40):**  It's not quite the real vanilla, but actually you can harness these microbes to make the  
**[0:20:44-0:20:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:20:44):**  actual vanilla that comes from a vanilla plant.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:20:47):**  And obviously vanilla itself, natural vanilla is very intensive in terms of land, time,  
**[0:20:52-0:20:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:20:52):**  effort.  
**[0:20:53-0:20:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:20:53):**  You know, it's quite a difficult crop.  
**[0:20:56-0:21:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:20:56):**  So if you can make the exact molecule this way, which is obviously better than from oil,  
**[0:21:00-0:21:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:21:00):**  then that's quite attractive.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:21:01):**  And a lot of flavors and fragrances are made, already made, can be made like this as well.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:21:06):**  And we've been looking at the consumer or our side of the equation.  
**[0:21:11-0:21:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:21:11):**  What does this mean for, because you specifically looked at factory farms in the US, what does  
**[0:21:17-0:21:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:21:17):**  this mean for, let's say the farmers and workers in these industries?  
**[0:21:21-0:21:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:21:21):**  Yeah.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:21:22):**  I mean, obviously it's hugely disruptive.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:21:24):**  And again, you know, we're not, I don't want to soften this.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:21:28):**  If what we say is true, then essentially, you know, there'll be millions of jobs lost  
**[0:21:32-0:21:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:21:32):**  because essentially if factory farmers, we know it won't exist.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:21:36):**  And just to put it, you're predicting by 2025 and 2030, what numbers in drops?  
**[0:21:43-0:21:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:21:43):**  So 2030, it's about a million, I think, workers are going to be fewer in the US will be impacted  
**[0:21:50-0:21:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:21:50):**  directly from this disruption.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:21:52):**  However, we also anticipate there could be an extra million jobs created if, you know,  
**[0:21:57-0:22:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:21:57):**  the US really takes on board this, just, you know, takes on board and becomes the leader,  
**[0:22:03-0:22:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:22:03):**  right?  
**[0:22:04-0:22:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:22:04):**  Because part of this is this disruption is coming whether the US or anyone resists it  
**[0:22:09-0:22:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:22:09):**  or not, and there's not going to be any geographical barriers to it.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:22:12):**  So if the US say resists or fails to support it, then other countries will just step in  
**[0:22:17-0:22:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:22:17):**  and capture the wealth and jobs and health benefits.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:22:20):**  So it's really a question here of whether the US can kind of step in and capture, or  
**[0:22:25-0:22:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:22:25):**  any country can kind of capture the extraordinary value that's going to be created.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:22:30):**  So it's much better to be at the beginning of a disruption in the end, because you don't  
**[0:22:35-0:22:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:22:35):**  capture those kind of intellectual benefits.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:22:38):**  So that's what we really kind of advocate for.  
**[0:22:40-0:22:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:22:40):**  We say, look, this disruption is coming, it's inevitable, and you need to get on top of  
**[0:22:44-0:22:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:22:44):**  this and think about how you can support the farmers and workers.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:22:48):**  Because we always say support, you know, support workers, not jobs.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:22:51):**  So it's about supporting the people that might be affected rather than trying to protect  
**[0:22:55-0:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:22:55):**  the jobs.  
**[0:22:56-0:23:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:22:56):**  And what does this mean for the farmers that are actually mostly growing, if you look on  
**[0:23:01-0:23:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:23:01):**  average in the US, crops for animals?  
**[0:23:04-0:23:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:23:04):**  So what does it mean for rural America?  
**[0:23:06-0:23:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:23:06):**  Yeah, I mean, there are huge impacts.  
**[0:23:09-0:23:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:23:09):**  We I think we forecast something like almost 500 million acres of land will not be needed  
**[0:23:16-0:23:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:23:16):**  in the way that it is now to produce crops.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:23:18):**  So it's going to create these huge opportunities for farmers.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:23:22):**  I mean, obviously, there's massive impacts such as land values could be decimated, right?  
**[0:23:26-0:23:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:23:26):**  They're going to be disproportionately affected by this impact, probably a likely rapid collapse  
**[0:23:31-0:23:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:23:31):**  in value.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:23:32):**  But, you know, which is something investors should take note of, because a lot of their  
**[0:23:36-0:23:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:23:36):**  models are based actually on land always has like the real assets, they always have value.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:23:43):**  Exactly.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:23:44):**  And, you know, we've seen a precedent for that land drop as well, value drop by more  
**[0:23:48-0:23:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:23:48):**  than 50%, I think, in the 20s and 30s, and then also another 40% in the 80s.  
**[0:23:54-0:23:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:23:54):**  So this has happened.  
**[0:23:55-0:23:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:23:55):**  So you can see a kind of disproportionate effect of land values.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:23:58):**  But then in terms of the farms themselves, I think, I know in the US isn't, you know,  
**[0:24:03-0:24:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:24:03):**  actually a lot of if you take out the CAFOs, many of the farms are actually more kind of  
**[0:24:07-0:24:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:24:07):**  across many different crops and products.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:24:11):**  And is that kind of a opportunity, I guess, to kind of switch the type of crops they use  
**[0:24:16-0:24:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:24:16):**  or go to a more gentrified farming model?  
**[0:24:20-0:24:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:24:20):**  There's a lot of choices to be made or go to crops that perhaps, you know, are needed  
**[0:24:23-0:24:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:24:23):**  because there'll be other crops that are needed to support this disruption and also kind of  
**[0:24:27-0:24:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:24:27):**  support just consumer changes in food as well.  
**[0:24:31-0:24:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:24:31):**  So I think there's still going to be crops needed, but it might require farmers to think  
**[0:24:34-0:24:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:24:34):**  about what they're cropping and move from this mono cropping culture a little bit.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:24:39):**  And that's ultimately better for the land.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:24:40):**  But these are all choices that we need to be made.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:24:42):**  Perhaps there's even choices to use the land for national parks or for solar panels for  
**[0:24:47-0:24:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:24:47):**  wilderness commercial industrial development.  
**[0:24:49-0:24:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:24:49):**  There's kind of a lot of other choices just even outside of farming.  
**[0:24:53-0:25:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:24:53):**  Now, you mentioned an interesting option in the report that the artisanal meat production,  
**[0:25:00-0:25:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:25:00):**  let's hope they're mostly regenerative, but let's call them artisanal for now, that probably  
**[0:25:03-0:25:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:25:03):**  in terms of price point, they will actually be it will be easier for them to compete as  
**[0:25:08-0:25:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:25:08):**  the meat prices will go up as the more profitable parts of the cow get disrupted first.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:25:13):**  So maybe the regenerative farmers listening to this podcast will actually find themselves  
**[0:25:17-0:25:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:25:17):**  in a position where it's actually easier to compete as meat prices of factory farmed meat  
**[0:25:24-0:25:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:25:24):**  will rise over the next years.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:25:26):**  And obviously the regenerative farmers still have their ecosystem services.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:25:30):**  And maybe this is actually a way to approach the discussion, should we eat animals or not?  
**[0:25:35-0:25:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:25:35):**  Or what's the role of animals in the landscape?  
**[0:25:38-0:25:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:25:38):**  And I think it's a separate discussion, the one should we eat animals or not, which will  
**[0:25:42-0:25:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:25:42):**  resolve over the next years.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:25:44):**  But there is a role.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:25:45):**  Is there a role for animals in landscape restoration?  
**[0:25:47-0:25:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:25:47):**  Is there a role for animals in soil regeneration, which then suddenly becomes a whole different  
**[0:25:52-0:25:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:25:52):**  discussion if the meat, if the pressure on the meat industry or producing the cheapest  
**[0:25:57-0:25:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:25:57):**  way possible is taken away?  
**[0:25:59-0:26:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:25:59):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:26:00):**  And something we've looked at in the report or looked at as part of our report, I don't  
**[0:26:04-0:26:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:26:04):**  know how much we can't, we touch on it a little bit is the idea that how we have used a cow  
**[0:26:08-0:26:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:26:08):**  has changed so much from 10,000 years ago, even a hundred years ago.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:26:12):**  A hundred years ago, a cow represented labor, energy, fertilizer, food storage, food value.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:26:19):**  You'd use to give them as dowries and still doing some of the world.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:26:23):**  But the whole, the cow is really, every part of the cow would be used, right?  
**[0:26:27-0:26:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:26:27):**  It'd be used for tools and the bones would be used.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:26:30):**  Everything would be used.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:26:31):**  And we've moved away from that really, and it's probably been the last 10, 20 years that  
**[0:26:35-0:26:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:26:35):**  we just now really, really only use the cow for meat.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:26:39):**  We also do use leather and dairy as well, but a cow is not used for the whole, some  
**[0:26:44-0:26:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:26:44):**  of its parts and what's really just used for one thing.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:26:47):**  And that is definitely a role for the idea that if you can basically go back to a time  
**[0:26:52-0:26:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:26:52):**  when the cow is being used as its whole rather than just for meat, it becomes a much more  
**[0:26:56-0:26:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:26:56):**  useful part of the environment.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:26:58):**  And so we're not saying, look, the cow is bad or the cow is good.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:27:01):**  We're just saying, look, how the cow as a technology to produce food has had its time.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:27:07):**  And there's going to be a technology that's going to come in and it's going to be better  
**[0:27:10-0:27:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:27:10):**  and cheaper and it's going to be replaced.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:27:12):**  So it doesn't necessarily mean that there's never going to be cows again, but it's like,  
**[0:27:15-0:27:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:27:15):**  what is the role?  
**[0:27:16-0:27:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:27:16):**  I guess there's some existential questions, but what is the role of a cow, right?  
**[0:27:21-0:27:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:27:21):**  So to be had by people, but we try not to talk about it in terms of the cow being good  
**[0:27:26-0:27:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:27:26):**  or bad.  
**[0:27:27-0:27:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:27:27):**  We say, look, this is just a technology that's going to be disrupted and that's going to  
**[0:27:30-0:27:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:27:30):**  have implications.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:27:31):**  No, I think you're absolutely right.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:27:33):**  I think the holistic view often gets missed, especially as we go to one single solution  
**[0:27:38-0:27:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:27:38):**  in this case, cow equals meat or equals a lot of products and not paying any attention  
**[0:27:43-0:27:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:27:43):**  of what role has the cow before that, which I mean, like you mentioned, was energy, et  
**[0:27:48-0:27:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:27:48):**  cetera.  
**[0:27:49-0:27:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:27:49):**  Not that we need to go back to putting cows in front of a plough, but there is something  
**[0:27:53-0:27:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:27:53):**  to learn there, especially on the higher level.  
**[0:27:56-0:27:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:27:56):**  Yeah, and the cow has been disrupted before, right?  
**[0:27:59-0:28:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:27:59):**  The refrigerator arguably disrupted the point of storage of food in a cow.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:28:04):**  You can now raise a cow and just basically convert it to meat in the quickest amount  
**[0:28:07-0:28:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:28:07):**  of time.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:28:08):**  You don't have to worry about storing the food.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:28:10):**  So I think we do need to move away a little bit and just think about that this is almost  
**[0:28:15-0:28:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:28:15):**  the final disruption, which also makes it inevitable in our view, and this is why it's  
**[0:28:21-0:28:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:28:21):**  going to happen.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:28:22):**  And in terms for investors listening to this, they might have positions in the space, they  
**[0:28:29-0:28:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:28:29):**  are very interested in soil, they're very interested in food.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:28:31):**  What would you tell them, apart from reading the report, what would you tell them, obviously  
**[0:28:36-0:28:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:28:36):**  not giving investment advice, but what to look out for, what to watch out for, let's  
**[0:28:40-0:28:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:28:40):**  say over the next 10 years as this revolution is coming or this disruption is happening?  
**[0:28:46-0:28:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:28:46):**  Yeah, and so I mean, for investors, I think we touched on land values a little bit about  
**[0:28:54-0:28:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:28:54):**  how they could be disproportionately affected.  
**[0:28:57-0:29:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:28:57):**  So if you're invested in areas of land, perhaps have a look.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:29:00):**  I would say the one thing is I know I've mentioned it before that this is an inevitable thing.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:29:06):**  So it's really about positioning themselves, how do they take advantage of the upside but  
**[0:29:10-0:29:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:29:10):**  mitigate the downside risk.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:29:12):**  And we kind of do think about disruption as being, the disruption is going to happen to  
**[0:29:16-0:29:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:29:16):**  the cows, so everything around the cow is going to be particularly impacted.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:29:20):**  And then perhaps as you get out, as you move away from the cow and the distribution and  
**[0:29:23-0:29:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:29:23):**  supply chain, it's maybe less impacted.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:29:26):**  So I guess it's about positioning themselves if they believe that this disruption is happening  
**[0:29:32-0:29:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:29:32):**  in order to kind of allow their portfolio to accept that.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:29:36):**  And what could go wrong in the sense of you're saying it's absolutely inevitable, but what's  
**[0:29:42-0:29:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:29:42):**  the least likely scenario?  
**[0:29:45-0:29:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:29:45):**  Is it going to go a lot slower?  
**[0:29:47-0:29:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:29:47):**  Is it going to be all taken up by the huge meat companies?  
**[0:29:50-0:29:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:29:50):**  What do you fear in terms of this disruption?  
**[0:29:53-0:29:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:29:53):**  I think it could be slower, but I think there can always be bits on the things that could  
**[0:29:59-0:30:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:29:59):**  impact how fast some of this technology improves.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:30:02):**  Even if we're like two or three years out, or even five, I would argue it doesn't make  
**[0:30:05-0:30:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:30:05):**  us wrong.  
**[0:30:06-0:30:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:30:06):**  It's probably still happening a lot quicker than people expect.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:30:10):**  And then I guess the adoption in terms of the investment and supply scale up.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:30:13):**  We have seen examples of scale up happening extremely quickly, for example, in bioethanol  
**[0:30:18-0:30:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:30:18):**  fuels.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:30:19):**  So we do believe that it can happen very quickly, but it may just take a bit longer than we  
**[0:30:24-0:30:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:30:24):**  expect that we have in our estimates.  
**[0:30:26-0:30:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:30:26):**  But as I said, I still think it's inevitable.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:30:29):**  It's just like, does it happen in 2030 or 2035?  
**[0:30:32-0:30:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:30:32):**  The other kind of pattern we often see in disruptions is often the old industry has  
**[0:30:37-0:30:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:30:37):**  a price spike before it kind of collapses.  
**[0:30:40-0:30:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:30:40):**  So we may actually see a kind of – and that's often to do just with a mismatch of supply  
**[0:30:44-0:30:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:30:44):**  and demand.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:30:45):**  So we've seen it with the coal industry as well.  
**[0:30:47-0:30:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:30:47):**  You had peak before you had the trough.  
**[0:30:50-0:30:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:30:50):**  We've seen it with Kodak had peak sales before they basically collapsed because of digital  
**[0:30:55-0:30:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:30:55):**  film.  
**[0:30:56-0:30:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:30:56):**  And so we may well see peak prices.  
**[0:30:58-0:31:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:30:58):**  So I think even if you see the high prices in meat over the next few years, I wouldn't  
**[0:31:02-0:31:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:31:02):**  necessarily dismiss this theory.  
**[0:31:04-0:31:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:31:04):**  I would just say it actually adds weight to it in some ways.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:31:07):**  But I would say, yeah.  
**[0:31:08-0:31:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:31:08):**  So can you explain that a bit?  
**[0:31:10-0:31:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:31:10):**  How does that work?  
**[0:31:12-0:31:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:31:12):**  How could it play out in meat production?  
**[0:31:14-0:31:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:31:14):**  Would there be higher prices in the supermarkets or higher stock prices of these CAFO operators  
**[0:31:19-0:31:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:31:19):**  or CAFO companies or very good production numbers and profits announced by them?  
**[0:31:27-0:31:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:31:27):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:31:28):**  So you may well see higher animal prices or cow prices, meat prices basically, which would  
**[0:31:35-0:31:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:31:35):**  not necessarily mean higher profits for Tyson because that's one of their cost of goods  
**[0:31:40-0:31:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:31:40):**  sold.  
**[0:31:41-0:31:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:31:41):**  But would actually almost kind of make Tyson perhaps double down and invest in this kind  
**[0:31:45-0:31:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:31:45):**  of alternative production.  
**[0:31:47-0:31:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:31:47):**  So yeah, you'd see higher prices for the farmers probably.  
**[0:31:51-0:31:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:31:51):**  But I don't – yeah, I mean, that's something we've seen in a lot of industries.  
**[0:31:54-0:31:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:31:54):**  So it's definitely kind of almost this peak before the bust idea.  
**[0:31:59-0:32:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:31:59):**  But Tyson themselves are investing in these alternatives.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:32:03):**  So you are seeing I think some of the companies themselves are actually aware of this disruption  
**[0:32:09-0:32:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:32:09):**  or keeping an eye on it.  
**[0:32:10-0:32:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:32:10):**  I think there's definitely been lessons learned from previous ones.  
**[0:32:14-0:32:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:32:14):**  So it'll be interesting to see how they kind of play out, if it's something they're actually  
**[0:32:18-0:32:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:32:18):**  committed to or whether they're kind of just doing it to keep an eye on the competition.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:32:23):**  And aren't you afraid for the nutrition part of things?  
**[0:32:26-0:32:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:32:26):**  I mean, it could be the acceptance of consumers because they might look differently at it,  
**[0:32:31-0:32:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:32:31):**  although it's a lot of ingredients we're talking about.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:32:34):**  But any early scandals or something that might slip through some of the filters, etc., could  
**[0:32:40-0:32:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:32:40):**  really disrupt this, as we've seen with a lot of new technologies in food.  
**[0:32:44-0:32:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:32:44):**  Food is a very touchy subject, obviously.  
**[0:32:46-0:32:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:32:46):**  Are you scared of any of those?  
**[0:32:49-0:32:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:32:49):**  Of course, we claim or you claim it's going to be exactly the same.  
**[0:32:53-0:32:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:32:53):**  But whenever somebody said that, it usually triggers a lot of questions.  
**[0:32:56-0:33:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:32:56):**  Do you see any potential anti disruption from the nutrition side of things?  
**[0:33:01-0:33:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:33:01):**  Yeah, I mean, much like parenting, everyone has an opinion on food.  
**[0:33:04-0:33:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:33:04):**  So I think, you know, you're right, it's a very, everyone has a very, is very subjective,  
**[0:33:10-0:33:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:33:10):**  everyone has their own opinion about food and rightly so.  
**[0:33:12-0:33:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:33:12):**  People choose what they eat, right?  
**[0:33:13-0:33:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:33:13):**  Most people are lucky enough to have that choice to choose what they eat.  
**[0:33:17-0:33:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:33:17):**  And we're not trying to tell people what to eat from this disruption.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:33:21):**  We're not saying you need to, we're just saying this is going to happen, it's going to be  
**[0:33:24-0:33:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:33:24):**  ingredients in these products.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:33:26):**  It's just a change and that we just see it as a shift in the production, right, system.  
**[0:33:30-0:33:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:33:30):**  So we're just saying it's a technology shift as opposed to kind of a consumer driven shift.  
**[0:33:35-0:33:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:33:35):**  But I mean, nutrition wise, I think kind of separately, there are like movements, obviously,  
**[0:33:39-0:33:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:33:39):**  about what is the correct nutrition.  
**[0:33:42-0:33:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:33:42):**  I am completely confident that this is going to be better.  
**[0:33:44-0:33:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:33:44):**  I mean, the one way I think that there's been a bit of a move, I think, at the moment, the  
**[0:33:48-0:33:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:33:48):**  idea of what's in meat, right?  
**[0:33:50-0:33:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:33:50):**  So what's actually in the food or the food we eat.  
**[0:33:52-0:33:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:33:52):**  So I think there has to be transparency, not only in kind of this technology, we do advocate  
**[0:33:56-0:34:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:33:56):**  for that nutritionally, for the food, and I think it will be over, it has to have this  
**[0:34:01-0:34:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:34:01):**  regulation around it, it should have this regulation around it.  
**[0:34:03-0:34:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:34:03):**  And there should be regulation in that, but also in the current industries, and they should  
**[0:34:07-0:34:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:34:07):**  match up.  
**[0:34:08-0:34:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:34:08):**  So I think that would be, that's my view of how I think, you know, these technologies  
**[0:34:13-0:34:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:34:13):**  need to be, it needs to be seen on a like for like basis across the whole food system.  
**[0:34:17-0:34:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:34:17):**  I mean, there is just to be, you know, to be very transparent that a lot of these molecules  
**[0:34:23-0:34:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:34:23):**  would be programmed.  
**[0:34:24-0:34:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:34:24):**  And when I say programmed, I mean, they would use biotechnology, so gene editing.  
**[0:34:29-0:34:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:34:29):**  And obviously, in some regions of the world, they don't approve that.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:34:31):**  So there are, you know, there are perhaps some kind of areas where just even how we  
**[0:34:36-0:34:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:34:36):**  define biotechnology needs to be looked up from a regulatory point of view.  
**[0:34:40-0:34:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:34:40):**  And I know, for example, Heem from Impossible has had some backlash as well of is it safe,  
**[0:34:45-0:34:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:34:45):**  is it healthy?  
**[0:34:46-0:34:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:34:46):**  So, you know, I think that that discussion needs to carry on, because it's really important,  
**[0:34:50-0:34:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:34:50):**  and there may be some proteins, you know, the technology itself, I think, is fine.  
**[0:34:53-0:34:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:34:53):**  It's just like the products they produce from it.  
**[0:34:56-0:34:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:34:56):**  So some proteins may or may not be good, but that doesn't make the technology bad.  
**[0:34:59-0:35:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:34:59):**  So I think, you know, time will tell in terms of what's produced and how we produce it.  
**[0:35:04-0:35:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:35:04):**  Yeah, I think there's going to be a lot of discussion.  
**[0:35:06-0:35:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:35:06):**  I mean, I see a lot of pushback on Impossible Burger for choosing GMO seeds and the glyphosate  
**[0:35:11-0:35:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:35:11):**  that comes with that.  
**[0:35:12-0:35:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:35:12):**  And actually Impossible both of when you take them apart nutritionally, there are a lot  
**[0:35:16-0:35:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:35:16):**  of questions on the recipe and the level of salt and the level of and you see, especially  
**[0:35:21-0:35:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:35:21):**  people in the region X, they're saying, this is not a replacement.  
**[0:35:23-0:35:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:35:23):**  Of course, you have to look at what it actually replaced in terms of a hamburger, which probably  
**[0:35:27-0:35:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:35:27):**  comes for sure from a factory farm.  
**[0:35:30-0:35:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:35:30):**  And like we said, we don't know what's in that.  
**[0:35:32-0:35:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:35:32):**  And probably if we don't want to, we should, but we don't want to.  
**[0:35:35-0:35:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:35:35):**  But if you compare it with, like you mentioned, artisanal grown or regenerative grown, it  
**[0:35:39-0:35:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:35:39):**  becomes a whole different discussion.  
**[0:35:41-0:35:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:35:41):**  But 99.9% of meat isn't grown like that at the moment.  
**[0:35:44-0:35:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:35:44):**  So it's but you get a text for that because it doesn't seem very healthy if you look at  
**[0:35:49-0:35:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:35:49):**  the ingredient list and nutrition depth of it.  
**[0:35:52-0:35:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:35:52):**  Yeah, we try not to get into the I mean, yeah, we try not to get into the discussion of what  
**[0:35:57-0:36:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:35:57):**  isn't healthy because that is a very divisive argument.  
**[0:36:00-0:36:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:36:00):**  However, we are saying that there's a production system change, we can change how we produce  
**[0:36:04-0:36:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:36:04):**  these to make it cheaper.  
**[0:36:06-0:36:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:36:06):**  Ultimately, I mean, consumers can change our opinion.  
**[0:36:09-0:36:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:36:09):**  And we see this as a software process.  
**[0:36:13-0:36:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:36:13):**  So the impossible 2.0 is better than the impossible 1.0.  
**[0:36:17-0:36:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:36:17):**  And the impossible 20.0 will be better.  
**[0:36:20-0:36:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:36:20):**  And when we say better, we mean in every way.  
**[0:36:23-0:36:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:36:23):**  So nutritionally, more like meat.  
**[0:36:25-0:36:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:36:25):**  So I think there's still movement to be made.  
**[0:36:28-0:36:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:36:28):**  But in terms of once that's almost a discussion to happen, I guess once the cow market is  
**[0:36:33-0:36:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:36:33):**  completely disrupted as well.  
**[0:36:34-0:36:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:36:34):**  Like if we don't even have animal meat anymore, what's the next discussion?  
**[0:36:39-0:36:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:36:39):**  You know, it probably does become more about kind of health.  
**[0:36:41-0:36:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:36:41):**  But again, we're not trying to if people don't want to eat an impossible because they don't  
**[0:36:44-0:36:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:36:44):**  think it's healthy, that's completely fine.  
**[0:36:47-0:36:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:36:47):**  You know, that no one is trying to tell anyone what to eat.  
**[0:36:50-0:36:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:36:50):**  And the impossible burger themselves say they are not trying to disrupt a vegetarian or  
**[0:36:53-0:36:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:36:53):**  vegan.  
**[0:36:54-0:36:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:36:54):**  They want to disrupt meat eaters.

**[0:40:24-0:40:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:40:24):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:40:29-0:40:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:40:29):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:40:35-0:40:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:40:35):**  invest in and what kind of co investors you could find or what kind of investors you could

**[0:40:46-0:40:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:40:46):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:40:50-0:40:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:40:50):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:40:55-0:40:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:40:55):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:40:56-0:40:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:40:56):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:40:57-0:41:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:40:57):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:41:00-0:41:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:41:00):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:41:04-0:41:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:41:04):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:41:06-0:41:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/12/10/catherine-tubb/#t=0:41:06):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.

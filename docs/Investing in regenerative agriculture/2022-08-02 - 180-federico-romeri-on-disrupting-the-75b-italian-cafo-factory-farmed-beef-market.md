### Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food  (Tue, 02 Aug 2022 17:00:00)
## 180 Federico Romeri on disrupting the â‚¬7,5B Italian CAFO factory farmed beef market  
**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  
**[0:00:05-0:00:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:00:05):**  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com or in the links below.  
**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:00:14):**  Everyone knows the animal protein market has to be disruptive, massively, and maybe most  
**[0:00:18-0:00:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:00:18):**  of all the beef market.  
**[0:00:20-0:00:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:00:20):**  Take for instance Italy where 85% of beef comes from factory farmed, which means inside  
**[0:00:24-0:00:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:00:24):**  with a lot of inputs and horrible animal welfare practices, plus of course the negative health  
**[0:00:29-0:00:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:00:29):**  outcomes for who consumes that meat.  
**[0:00:32-0:00:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:00:32):**  Plus 50% of the total beef consumption is actually imported, many cases from questionable  
**[0:00:37-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:00:37):**  markets.  
**[0:00:38-0:00:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:00:38):**  Saying this should change is easy but how do you actually do that?  
**[0:00:41-0:00:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:00:41):**  How do you build a supply chain or web from the ground up, B2C vs B2B and how do you work  
**[0:00:47-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:00:47):**  with the large supermarket chains to get your products in front of more people?  
**[0:00:54-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:00:54):**  This is the Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food podcast.  
**[0:00:58-0:01:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:00:58):**  Talking as if the planet mattered, where we talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food  
**[0:01:02-0:01:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:01:02):**  and agriculture space to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil,  
**[0:01:07-0:01:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:01:07):**  people, local communities, and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:13-0:01:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:01:13):**  Why my focus on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:16-0:01:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:01:16):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:19-0:01:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:01:19):**  our land and our sea, grow our food, what we eat, wear and consume.  
**[0:01:24-0:01:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:01:24):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:28-0:01:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:01:28):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:01:31):**  To make it easy for fans to support our work we launched our membership community and so

**[0:01:59-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:01:59):**  Welcome to another episode.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:02:00):**  Today we go deep into the beef market in Italy and how to move it from CAFO factory farmed  
**[0:02:04-0:02:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:02:04):**  to outside on the Alpine meadows as you imagine in these beautiful commercials.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:02:10):**  I have the very great pleasure to have the founder of Pascal today with me.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:02:14):**  Welcome Federico.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:02:15):**  Hi Koen, thank you for inviting me.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:02:19):**  And to ask the first question we always like to ask at the beginning, how did you end up?  
**[0:02:25-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:02:25):**  I mean, I don't think you were raised as a shepherd and saw the decline of the shepherds  
**[0:02:30-0:02:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:02:30):**  going with their cows into the Alpine meadows and moving up and down.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:02:35):**  I think you were raised in a medium sized city.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:02:38):**  So how did your interest in the meat market, the beef market, factory farming and at the  
**[0:02:43-0:02:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:02:43):**  end because we're going to talk about that for sure, soil, how did that start?  
**[0:02:47-0:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:02:47):**  How did you, cause you're, you're relatively young.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:02:49):**  The viewers cannot see that, but we put a picture, like how did you roll into disrupting  
**[0:02:53-0:02:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:02:53):**  the beef market in Italy?  
**[0:02:55-0:02:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:02:55):**  I studied economics.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:02:57):**  So another kind of field, but with a lot of connection with the food industry, because  
**[0:03:04-0:03:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:03:04):**  you know, everything it's about money and economics.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:03:07):**  So I think that's the starting point.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:03:13):**  And to be honest, I made this choice for a selfish purpose probably because I don't have  
**[0:03:19-0:03:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:03:19):**  the presumption to change the world.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:03:23):**  And I simply tried to make the best possible food choice and to give as many people as  
**[0:03:27-0:03:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:03:27):**  possible the freedom to make the same choice.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:03:32):**  And so, you know, for a selfish purpose, as I said, I needed to eat good food in general,  
**[0:03:41-0:03:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:03:41):**  not just meat, but also vegetables and so on.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:03:44):**  And you know, I think that the food chains in general nowadays have a very bad impact  
**[0:03:53-0:03:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:03:53):**  on both the social and environmental dimension.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:03:58):**  And in the specific, the meat industry has a very, very bad impact.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:04:04):**  And we are trying to build a different supply chain about beef in Italy.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:04:12):**  It's a nice answer, but I want to unpack it a bit more as you, I mean, you live in the  
**[0:04:17-0:04:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:04:17):**  north of Italy, relatively close to the Alps.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:04:20):**  You probably would have had access yourself if you searched a bit to this kind of meat.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:04:26):**  But it's quite a step to go from, I don't know, with friends buying a cow and make sure  
**[0:04:31-0:04:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:04:31):**  it's slaughtered properly, make sure it was raised properly, and then putting your freezer  
**[0:04:34-0:04:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:04:34):**  full and be fine for a year.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:04:36):**  Going from that to processing many other cows and supplying it to others.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:04:41):**  I mean, it's a nice notion to say, I would like others to have that same option.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:04:45):**  But that means dedicating your work life to that basically, and probably more in the startup  
**[0:04:50-0:04:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:04:50):**  phase.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:04:51):**  So when did that click came from, I want to have access to this, but others don't.  
**[0:04:55-0:05:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:04:55):**  I see an opportunity here and I want to start a company and not just like an organization  
**[0:05:01-0:05:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:05:01):**  to promote this kind of food choices.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:05:04):**  What made you choose to basically dedicate your work life to this as well?  
**[0:05:08-0:05:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:05:08):**  To be honest, I love to do startup in general, to do new things that are not already done  
**[0:05:16-0:05:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:05:16):**  before.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:05:17):**  And, you know, we focus on meat so far, but it's not my life reason.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:05:26):**  You know, I try to change this sector now, but probably I'll do something else in the  
**[0:05:33-0:05:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:05:33):**  future.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:05:34):**  You know, the important things for me, it's just giving good impact to the world and about  
**[0:05:43-0:05:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:05:43):**  food or other industries, not that point.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:05:46):**  So I think, you know, it's a sense of ethics probably that guide my steps.  
**[0:05:54-0:05:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:05:54):**  And so let's describe Pasco as I think in Italy, it didn't exist something like that  
**[0:05:59-0:06:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:05:59):**  you have, I would say similar or let's say colleagues in other countries, like special  
**[0:06:06-0:06:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:06:06):**  meat boxes, the ethical butcher in the UK and some other places.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:06:09):**  And did you look around in Italy and thought, oh, there's nobody is like supplying ethnically  
**[0:06:14-0:06:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:06:14):**  sourced small producers, obviously proper grazing management.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:06:18):**  And we're going to talk about that to the supplier.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:06:20):**  You said, OK, let's let's set up Pasco.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:06:22):**  If you have to describe now, because you are obviously you're fundraising, you're presenting  
**[0:06:26-0:06:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:06:26):**  it a lot.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:06:27):**  Like, how do you how do you describe Pasco in a few or a few more sentences?  
**[0:06:33-0:06:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:06:33):**  We started from an objective problem around the 85 percent of meat we consume in Italy  
**[0:06:39-0:06:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:06:39):**  comes from intensive kind of breeding.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:06:42):**  And around 50 percent of the entire cake, you know, comes from abroad.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:06:47):**  So the supply chain is broken, unsustainable.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:06:51):**  Yeah, it's broken, both for the methodologies and also for the logistic.  
**[0:06:56-0:07:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:06:56):**  So just to recap, 85 percent, which is I think in Europe more or less the same, even a bit  
**[0:07:02-0:07:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:07:02):**  higher, I think in many places comes from factory farmed cows that never seen the light  
**[0:07:08-0:07:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:07:08):**  of day that are fed on imported feed in many cases.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:07:12):**  And we all know the destruction that comes from that.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:07:14):**  Plus the animal welfare is horrendous.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:07:15):**  I mean, you shouldn't feed soy to a ruminant ever.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:07:19):**  And then on top of that, you're mentioning 50 percent of the total market actually is  
**[0:07:23-0:07:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:07:23):**  imported, which comes from many, many different places, some places better, many places worse  
**[0:07:27-0:07:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:07:27):**  than what you find close to you.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:07:29):**  So there's a yeah, there's a broken market there waiting to be disrupted.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:07:33):**  And how do you approach that?  
**[0:07:36-0:07:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:07:36):**  So we select small farms who breed cows cattle extensively.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:07:43):**  So basically they bring cows to the pasture and they ensure high level of animal welfare  
**[0:07:49-0:07:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:07:49):**  and basically life accordingly to biological needs.  
**[0:07:55-0:07:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:07:55):**  You know, following first principles basically.  
**[0:07:58-0:07:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:07:58):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:07:59):**  It's pretty easy.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:08:01):**  You just have to observe nature and just copy and paste everything it's written there.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:08:08):**  You don't have to invent anything new.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:08:10):**  And what we are doing, it's cool about traceability also, because on any piece of meat that you  
**[0:08:18-0:08:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:08:18):**  can you can say which is the exactly farms where that meat comes from.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:08:26):**  So we have an innovative traceability system.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:08:30):**  And so we have like a livestock team who select the breeders and support them also with free  
**[0:08:40-0:08:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:08:40):**  consultancy and so on.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:08:42):**  And we are also developing a side project.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:08:46):**  For instance, we are talking with No Fencer, a friend of the podcast.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:08:51):**  I will link them below, virtual fencing, if you want to know more.  
**[0:08:55-0:08:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:08:55):**  Very innovative.  
**[0:08:56-0:08:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:08:56):**  And of course, for Alpine Meadows, potentially disrupting and interesting.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:08:59):**  You can do interesting things.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:09:01):**  Yeah.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:09:02):**  So first of all, we select breeders who are already integrated with the territory, with  
**[0:09:08-0:09:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:09:08):**  the environment and we try to improve, further their farm.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:09:14):**  Then we buy cows.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:09:17):**  The slaughter is very close to the farmer.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:09:19):**  We have selected breeders in six regions in Italy, in the northern and central part of  
**[0:09:25-0:09:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:09:25):**  the country.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:09:26):**  And we have many slaughterhouses in any region in order to make that process very, very short.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:09:38):**  Is that an issue?  
**[0:09:39-0:09:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:09:39):**  Because we had a full interview with Dan Miller, which I will link below as well, on slaughter  
**[0:09:43-0:09:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:09:43):**  facilities in the US where cows have to travel seven, eight, 10 hours to get to a slaughter  
**[0:09:48-0:09:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:09:48):**  facility.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:09:50):**  And in many cases, it's a huge industrial one and they don't do the cuts you want or  
**[0:09:54-0:09:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:09:54):**  they don't have space.  
**[0:09:55-0:09:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:09:55):**  So in Italy, is that not an issue?  
**[0:09:57-0:10:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:09:57):**  Can you find slaughterhouses that work well, of course, but that are nearby these farms  
**[0:10:01-0:10:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:10:01):**  or is that becoming challenging also in Italy?  
**[0:10:06-0:10:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:10:06):**  We have them because we have also a regulation approved by the Ministry and also these slaughterhouses  
**[0:10:12-0:10:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:10:12):**  entering to these regulations.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:10:14):**  So they're still there.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:10:15):**  Slaughterhouses are still there.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:10:17):**  That infrastructure luckily didn't disappear yet.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:10:19):**  Okay.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:10:20):**  Okay.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:10:21):**  That's fundamental.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:10:22):**  So you have them slaughtered nearby.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:10:23):**  Yeah.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:10:24):**  And then what happens?  
**[0:10:26-0:10:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:10:26):**  And then we transport the meat to a central plant basically in Brescia, in Lombardy.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:10:37):**  And then we process the meat in different cuts.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:10:44):**  And we distributed it.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:10:46):**  We started in 2019 on B2C channels.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:10:52):**  So the e-commerce basically.  
**[0:10:55-0:11:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:10:55):**  And then we approached also the B2B channels because our value proposition, it's not about  
**[0:11:01-0:11:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:11:01):**  the distribution of the product, but about the product itself.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:11:05):**  So we don't care a lot where the product goes.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:11:10):**  The only important thing is that with the product, it's also the message, the vision.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:11:19):**  We want to give the customer the freedom to make a choice different with their money,  
**[0:11:31-0:11:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:11:31):**  adding value to the system.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:11:32):**  Because we think that the biggest way in order to change things, it's consciousness in consumption.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:11:40):**  Yeah.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:11:41):**  So you start...  
**[0:11:42-0:11:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:11:42):**  There's so much sandbag there.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:11:43):**  I'm assuming you obviously pay more to the farmers than they would, and I would love  
**[0:11:50-0:11:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:11:50):**  to explore more also why they're not doing this themselves, like what's holding them  
**[0:11:54-0:11:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:11:54):**  back.  
**[0:11:55-0:11:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:11:55):**  And then there's a very interesting piece we're going to get to, which is B2C, so direct  
**[0:11:58-0:12:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:11:58):**  to consumers online, which obviously everybody...  
**[0:12:00-0:12:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:12:00):**  You can keep all the margins, et cetera.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:12:01):**  I think many people underestimate how expensive it is to get things in a fresh way to people's  
**[0:12:06-0:12:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:12:06):**  house.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:12:07):**  And then you went to...  
**[0:12:08-0:12:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:12:08):**  You started talking to the big supermarkets, actually talking to, you're actually selling  
**[0:12:12-0:12:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:12:12):**  through them.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:12:13):**  And you said, yeah, we don't really care if they do the distribution as long as the message  
**[0:12:16-0:12:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:12:16):**  gets our meaning.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:12:17):**  It has to be in a Pascal way presented.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:12:20):**  It cannot go into some kind of commodity market and then be white labeled.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:12:24):**  Is that an issue actually?  
**[0:12:27-0:12:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:12:27):**  Let's start with the question of trying...  
**[0:12:28-0:12:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:12:28):**  I'm imagining you're trying to sell the whole animal.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:12:31):**  The fact that you're doing obviously B2C, you can steer that.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:12:34):**  You can have the boxes, you can have pieces together.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:12:37):**  Then moving to B2B, is that an issue?  
**[0:12:41-0:12:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:12:41):**  Do you get left over with certain pieces more than other, or is the deal with a big supermarket,  
**[0:12:45-0:12:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:12:45):**  look, you have to take everything and that's the deal because we're slaughtering animals,  
**[0:12:49-0:12:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:12:49):**  not pieces of animal?  
**[0:12:50-0:12:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:12:50):**  Yeah, this is a very difficult thing.  
**[0:12:56-0:12:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:12:56):**  As you said, we buy just entire animals.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:12:59):**  And so I think the secret in order to sell everything in a good way is having a lot of  
**[0:13:06-0:13:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:13:06):**  clients in different sector.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:13:09):**  For instance, butchers, of course, large distribution stores, and also, for instance, burgers stores.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:13:20):**  So you have to have a lot of clients in order to make any cats without problem.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:13:30):**  And of course, at the beginning of this, it was a big problem.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:13:36):**  But now we already have a good amount of clients in order to sell everything in a good way.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:13:44):**  And for the producers you work with, what holds them back to do this themselves?  
**[0:13:51-0:13:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:13:51):**  Like why, if they already work with a local butcher to slaughter, basically, then what  
**[0:13:57-0:14:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:13:57):**  keeps them from selling it themselves compared to selling the animal to you?  
**[0:14:03-0:14:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:14:03):**  Is that much easier?  
**[0:14:05-0:14:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:14:05):**  Is that like the marketing piece, obviously distribution?  
**[0:14:08-0:14:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:14:08):**  What makes them wanting to work with you, apart from that you probably pay hopefully  
**[0:14:12-0:14:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:14:12):**  early and good prices?  
**[0:14:14-0:14:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:14:14):**  Yeah, I mean, there are no large enough fields in order to scale these kind of farms.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:14:22):**  So if you want to do extensive kind of breeding in Italy, you have to keep your farm small  
**[0:14:27-0:14:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:14:27):**  or medium at the maximum.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:14:29):**  You cannot, you know,  
**[0:14:30-0:14:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:14:30):**  What is medium?  
**[0:14:31-0:14:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:14:31):**  How many animals are we talking about with medium?  
**[0:14:34-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:14:34):**  In average between 100 and 300 animals per cattle.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:14:40):**  So not a lot.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:14:42):**  And you know, if you want to scale it, you have to do intensive because there are not  
**[0:14:47-0:14:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:14:47):**  enough big spaces in order to put all these animals at the pasture in Italy.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:14:54):**  Because yeah, it becomes a herd basically.  
**[0:14:57-0:14:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:14:57):**  Yeah.  
**[0:14:58-0:14:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:14:58):**  Of course.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:14:59):**  So they are relatively small.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:15:00):**  Yeah.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:15:01):**  So the local farmers in this dimension cannot build, for instance, managerial activities,  
**[0:15:11-0:15:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:15:11):**  cannot build a sales team, cannot organize in a very well system, logistics and supply  
**[0:15:20-0:15:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:15:20):**  chain.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:15:21):**  They, you know, the intensive breeding have short term return on investment because the  
**[0:15:31-0:15:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:15:31):**  animal life cycle is shortened.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:15:33):**  I mean, you have an already animal maybe in one year and a half.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:15:39):**  In this case, maybe you need three years or so to double.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:15:45):**  And you cannot either do marketing and communication in a good way because you're maybe you're  
**[0:15:50-0:15:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:15:50):**  probably two people, three people, four people at the maximum.  
**[0:15:54-0:16:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:15:54):**  And you don't have the know how and the capabilities in order to make the value proposition and  
**[0:16:01-0:16:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:16:01):**  all the values that your farms has.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:16:05):**  And so they have very big problems about commercial activities.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:16:12):**  They sell to private people, as you said before, that they buy the entire cows and put into  
**[0:16:17-0:16:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:16:17):**  the refrigerator or to local butchers.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:16:24):**  But anytime it's like a bargain with the butcher.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:16:28):**  And so they raise cows, but they don't be sure to sell the whole production.  
**[0:16:37-0:16:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:16:37):**  And what we do is, of course, support the breeder, pay them more compared to the market  
**[0:16:46-0:16:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:16:46):**  and ensure to buy the whole production.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:16:49):**  So the breeder can think just to breed and to improve the methodologies in breeding,  
**[0:16:56-0:16:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:16:56):**  pasture and so on, animal welfare.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:16:59):**  And yeah, I think this is the best way in order.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:17:02):**  So any step of the supply chain focus just on its own.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:17:09):**  His own specialization.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:17:10):**  Yeah.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:17:11):**  So how has been the impact for some of the breeders, like how like you're relatively  
**[0:17:18-0:17:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:17:18):**  young as a company, three years, you mentioned 2019, like some of the oldest ones you've  
**[0:17:22-0:17:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:17:22):**  been working with, like how has that changed?  
**[0:17:24-0:17:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:17:24):**  Has that fundamentally changed their business outcome or like have they hired new people  
**[0:17:31-0:17:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:17:31):**  or gone back to the land?  
**[0:17:32-0:17:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:17:32):**  Like what has been the impact of offering this sales channel basically or this secure,  
**[0:17:38-0:17:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:17:38):**  well-paid sales channel?  
**[0:17:39-0:17:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:17:39):**  Have you seen impact on the land or impact in this case with the communities?  
**[0:17:43-0:17:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:17:43):**  Yes, of course.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:17:45):**  They're changing, they're growing.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:17:47):**  For instance, of course, we just select breeders who already are at a very high level.  
**[0:17:55-0:18:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:17:55):**  But for instance, they cultivate a lot of fields with conventional methodologies and  
**[0:18:02-0:18:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:18:02):**  they're changing to organic methodologies, for instance.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:18:06):**  They're buying more animals.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:18:09):**  There are many abandoned fields to do pasture, mainly in the Alps and they are recovering  
**[0:18:16-0:18:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:18:16):**  them.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:18:17):**  But yeah, we started in 2019 in two people and me and my co-founder were both economics  
**[0:18:27-0:18:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:18:27):**  students and probably we couldn't distinguish a donkey from a cow at the beginning.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:18:37):**  And so just in the last year, we built a strong team about livestock and we are getting results  
**[0:18:48-0:18:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:18:48):**  now and next year we are seeing more.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:18:52):**  And just the impact of animals on, like you mentioned, their abandoned pastures in the  
**[0:18:57-0:19:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:18:57):**  Alps, like what happens if they're abandoned?  
**[0:19:01-0:19:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:19:01):**  Why is the animal impact there or is the animal impact important?  
**[0:19:04-0:19:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:19:04):**  And if yes, why?  
**[0:19:05-0:19:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:19:05):**  Yeah, there is a very big biodiversity system related to the pasture.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:19:12):**  So insects, other animals, plants and so on.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:19:18):**  And according to WWF, we are losing around 20% of semi-natural spaces because we are  
**[0:19:29-0:19:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:19:29):**  stopping doing the practice of pasture with animals.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:19:35):**  And so I think that the soil can erode, first of all, because there are fields without trees,  
**[0:19:45-0:19:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:19:45):**  without anything.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:19:47):**  So if there are no animals who fertilize the soil and so on, there are systemic damages,  
**[0:19:55-0:19:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:19:55):**  basically.  
**[0:19:56-0:20:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:19:56):**  And in other cases, simply the forest or the trees can get back and get the pasture.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:20:05):**  And what are your plans on that side, like on the grazing?  
**[0:20:10-0:20:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:20:10):**  There's a lot of discussion, obviously.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:20:11):**  We had a lot of conversations here in the podcast as well.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:20:14):**  What do you see there as potential to work with these farmers that are already at a relatively  
**[0:20:20-0:20:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:20:20):**  high level?  
**[0:20:21-0:20:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:20:21):**  Like, what do you see that you can do with them over the next years to improve grazing,  
**[0:20:25-0:20:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:20:25):**  to start measuring soil organic matter, the impact of the animals on the land, also biodiversity,  
**[0:20:30-0:20:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:20:30):**  etc.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:20:31):**  What are your plans on, let's say, the side effect of having animals on the land in a  
**[0:20:37-0:20:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:20:37):**  proper way?  
**[0:20:38-0:20:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:20:38):**  Yeah, we are working with universities also, for instance, the University of Florence.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:20:46):**  And first of all, we are trying to implement a measurement system into the fields in order  
**[0:20:55-0:21:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:20:55):**  to understand exactly how the amount, for instance, about organic matter into the soil  
**[0:21:02-0:21:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:21:02):**  or all these things.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:21:04):**  So we would like to collect data, first of all.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:21:08):**  And it's pretty obvious that following the nature path, as we said before, is the right  
**[0:21:18-0:21:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:21:18):**  choice because you have to copy and paste.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:21:21):**  But we would like also to measure the data in order to understand specifically where  
**[0:21:27-0:21:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:21:27):**  we are going.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:21:28):**  How are the farmers interested in that?  
**[0:21:34-0:21:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:21:34):**  How are they receptive?  
**[0:21:35-0:21:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:21:35):**  When you come in, of course, to guys that don't distinguish a donkey from a cow, you  
**[0:21:41-0:21:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:21:41):**  say, maybe grazing could be different.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:21:43):**  How do they take that?  
**[0:21:44-0:21:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:21:44):**  Or what is your strategy there to take them along, let's say, in this journey of discovering  
**[0:21:51-0:21:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:21:51):**  how to get more biomass, more biodiversity, more life, more healthier cows, better grass  
**[0:21:56-0:22:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:21:56):**  management, etc., but not wanting to be pushed off the farm as go back to the city and go  
**[0:22:03-0:22:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:22:03):**  do something useful?  
**[0:22:04-0:22:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:22:04):**  I mean, our breeders follow us because they trust us because we prove that we are trustable.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:22:14):**  But we explain to them also that from an economic point of view, in the long term, the nature  
**[0:22:23-0:22:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:22:23):**  path is the best one.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:22:25):**  Because in the short term, with chemicals and so on, of course, you can improve the  
**[0:22:34-0:22:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:22:34):**  quantity of product that you make.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:22:38):**  But in the long term, it's all about fertility of the soil, it's all about biodiversity.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:22:45):**  And I think that now, and quality, of course, nowadays, sustainability, it's probably a  
**[0:22:53-0:22:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:22:53):**  matter of, it's an optional choice.  
**[0:22:57-0:23:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:22:57):**  In 10 years, maybe 15, 20, 30, I don't know, but it will happen.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:23:02):**  Sustainability, it will be a mandatory choice.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:23:05):**  So either these or you don't eat.  
**[0:23:09-0:23:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:23:09):**  And what about the quality?  
**[0:23:11-0:23:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:23:11):**  Do you do I mean, obviously, you are eating your own padding, let's say you're one of  
**[0:23:16-0:23:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:23:16):**  the clients, but what do clients say, customers say?  
**[0:23:20-0:23:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:23:20):**  What do you have you seen?  
**[0:23:21-0:23:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:23:21):**  Are you doing any potential research in the future on like, say, the nutrients compared  
**[0:23:25-0:23:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:23:25):**  to and then we get to the supermarket piece, which is fascinating.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:23:29):**  But like next to the ones like imagine the supermarket in the shelf, there is the Pascal  
**[0:23:34-0:23:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:23:34):**  aisle.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:23:35):**  And then next next to it is, let's say the factory farm ones, etc.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:23:39):**  Like how would you describe the difference between the two in taste, in color, in nutrients?  
**[0:23:44-0:23:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:23:44):**  Like how do you how do you how would you describe that to someone that hasn't tasted the difference  
**[0:23:49-0:23:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:23:49):**  yet?  
**[0:23:50-0:23:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:23:50):**  Yeah, the taste is original.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:23:52):**  I mean, you feel the meat.  
**[0:23:56-0:24:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:23:56):**  And about properties of the meat, it really depends on the pasture on the animal on the  
**[0:24:04-0:24:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:24:04):**  zone on the area.  
**[0:24:05-0:24:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:24:05):**  There are many factors that can influence these.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:24:09):**  And we, of course, make averages in order to, you know, give data in general to our  
**[0:24:19-0:24:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:24:19):**  customer that these data are very, very higher than the average of the conventional market  
**[0:24:26-0:24:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:24:26):**  about protein, about many things that are contained in the meat, vitamins, etc.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:24:33):**  And so how has been the response from from customers when they taste?  
**[0:24:39-0:24:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:24:39):**  I mean, how do you get a lot of repeat when you're growing as a company?  
**[0:24:42-0:24:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:24:42):**  So I'm imagining, yes, like people are discovering like how meat used to taste or how meat could  
**[0:24:48-0:24:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:24:48):**  taste, etc.  
**[0:24:49-0:24:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:24:49):**  How has been response from the market?  
**[0:24:51-0:24:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:24:51):**  Yeah, they love, of course, the taste of the meat.  
**[0:24:56-0:25:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:24:56):**  But I think that our customer may be bypassed because of the value proposition.  
**[0:25:04-0:25:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:25:04):**  So they like to spend their money in this way.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:25:08):**  They like to give money to breeders who follow this kind of methodology.  
**[0:25:14-0:25:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:25:14):**  They like to ensure animals are good life, basically, and all these things.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:25:21):**  And also in marketing communication, we put a lot of focus in about these topics.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:25:27):**  We don't focus a lot on the product that is very, very good, but it's OK.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:25:33):**  We focus mainly on the side effect that your choice brings.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:25:38):**  And so then how did you and why?  
**[0:25:41-0:25:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:25:41):**  And let's let's talk about the details there decided to start selling in the big supermarkets,  
**[0:25:46-0:25:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:25:46):**  the big ones, a quote unquote enemies, but the large ones that are selling all the low  
**[0:25:52-0:25:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:25:52):**  quality ones as well.  
**[0:25:53-0:25:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:25:53):**  How did that happen?  
**[0:25:54-0:25:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:25:54):**  Did they reach out to you?  
**[0:25:55-0:25:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:25:55):**  Did you reach out to them?  
**[0:25:56-0:25:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:25:56):**  Why didn't you stay in?  
**[0:25:58-0:26:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:25:58):**  Let's sell directly online.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:26:00):**  Let's keep that, let's say, relationship completely with us.  
**[0:26:04-0:26:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:26:04):**  Why did you decide to go to the large distribution centers to supermarkets, which are massive  
**[0:26:09-0:26:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:26:09):**  in Italy?  
**[0:26:10-0:26:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:26:10):**  I want to understand, like there are a few really, really, really big ones.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:26:13):**  Yeah, mainly in this in this country, the e-commerce market is not scalable at all.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:26:21):**  If you have one product, mainly because, you know, people won't buy meat on one website,  
**[0:26:28-0:26:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:26:28):**  fish on another, vegetables on another one and just wait maybe two or three days for  
**[0:26:35-0:26:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:26:35):**  the delivery.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:26:36):**  So you reached sort of a limit of what was possible.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:26:40):**  I think that the problem is not distribution.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:26:43):**  I think the problem is production and consumption.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:26:48):**  So we have to, first of all, I think, educate the customers because they give money to producers  
**[0:26:57-0:26:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:26:57):**  in order to produce.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:26:59):**  And I mean, we have a producer and customer that should be educated, of course.  
**[0:27:04-0:27:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:27:04):**  And the distribution just follow the education of these groups.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:27:10):**  I mean, I don't think that the big distribution and large distribution are the root of the  
**[0:27:18-0:27:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:27:18):**  problem.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:27:19):**  I think it's just a consequence.  
**[0:27:20-0:27:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:27:20):**  And so you started talking to them or they started talking to you.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:27:24):**  And then what does it mean for your margins?  
**[0:27:27-0:27:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:27:27):**  Obviously, you keep more of it, but you have more costs if you're selling directly.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:27:31):**  How does that work in large supermarkets, because what you don't want is become the  
**[0:27:35-0:27:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:27:35):**  discounted article, like the one day they get people in with like some of the veggies  
**[0:27:38-0:27:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:27:38):**  are always used and some of the meat as well to pull people into the supermarket.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:27:42):**  And then we hope you buy some brand things that have more interesting margins.  
**[0:27:46-0:27:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:27:46):**  How do you dance with such a big player that obviously is able to push or not because they  
**[0:27:53-0:27:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:27:53):**  are massive compared to such a small player as you?  
**[0:27:57-0:28:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:27:57):**  Yeah, we are some people in the large distribution sector and large distribution love our product.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:28:06):**  We are not a commodity.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:28:08):**  We are not just about margin for them, but we are also about branding.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:28:14):**  So in our case, our margin is very good.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:28:18):**  And taking into consideration the deliveries that are very, very, the B2C deliveries that  
**[0:28:27-0:28:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:28:27):**  cost a lot in this country, the margin is pretty much the same.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:28:33):**  That's a fair margin.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:28:37):**  And yeah, as I said, the distribution brings Pascal into their store also because the branding  
**[0:28:44-0:28:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:28:44):**  and because they love to associate their brand with someone who tries to bring value to the  
**[0:28:53-0:28:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:28:53):**  environment to the small breeders and so on.  
**[0:28:56-0:29:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:28:56):**  Do you see people then buying it in the supermarket and some of them buying it then directly from  
**[0:29:01-0:29:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:29:01):**  you or they stay in the supermarket?  
**[0:29:02-0:29:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:29:02):**  Because as you said, it's easier to buy your fish or veggies and everything in one place  
**[0:29:07-0:29:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:29:07):**  and bring it home immediately.  
**[0:29:08-0:29:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:29:08):**  Or is there some like some linkage between the B2C and the B2B?  
**[0:29:14-0:29:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:29:14):**  So we will be in 220 stores by the end of June.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:29:19):**  But so far, we are just in 25 supermarkets.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:29:23):**  So we don't have enough data in order to say that.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:29:26):**  To say too much about that.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:29:27):**  I hope that yeah, they will buy in the supermarkets and then online.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:29:33):**  Yeah.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:29:34):**  But for your margins, what you mentioned, it doesn't really matter.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:29:36):**  So it's also I mean, it's a lot less hassle, obviously, if you sell it to one supermarket  
**[0:29:41-0:29:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:29:41):**  chain and then it's they do the distribution, which you mentioned a few times you don't  
**[0:29:45-0:29:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:29:45):**  want to or you don't think it needs to be reinvented.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:29:48):**  That's not where the root cause is.  
**[0:29:50-0:29:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:29:50):**  The root causes are food choices and the production methods.  
**[0:29:54-0:30:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:29:54):**  And so you what would you say to like say, for sure, you're talking to them as well in  
**[0:30:00-0:30:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:30:00):**  Milan and other places to the finance world to the people looking at and in some cases  
**[0:30:04-0:30:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:30:04):**  financing the large industrial, very intensive and very extractive meat industry.  
**[0:30:11-0:30:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:30:11):**  Let's say we're in a theater.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:30:13):**  Let's change the setting a bit.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:30:15):**  We're in a theater, we're on stage and this is a meat conference in Italy and we're having  
**[0:30:19-0:30:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:30:19):**  this conversation there.  
**[0:30:20-0:30:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:30:20):**  What would you tell them?  
**[0:30:21-0:30:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:30:21):**  What would you tell them when they walk out of that room?  
**[0:30:25-0:30:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:30:25):**  What they should do or what they should be looking at?  
**[0:30:27-0:30:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:30:27):**  What they should be digging a bit deeper?  
**[0:30:29-0:30:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:30:29):**  What would be obviously without giving investment advice, but what would be your direction for  
**[0:30:34-0:30:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:30:34):**  the finance world that is involved in the meat industry to go to?  
**[0:30:38-0:30:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:30:38):**  This is a very difficult question.  
**[0:30:41-0:30:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:30:41):**  I think the problem is rooted into the system and the ideas and mentality.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:30:49):**  So I think that until we change that, you know, going to the financial system or others.  
**[0:30:59-0:31:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:30:59):**  We have them in that audience.  
**[0:31:00-0:31:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:31:00):**  They're sitting there.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:31:01):**  What would you tell them, like nature is always right or visit this, visit this and this or  
**[0:31:08-0:31:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:31:08):**  look at that?  
**[0:31:09-0:31:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:31:09):**  Where would you guide them?  
**[0:31:11-0:31:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:31:11):**  What to read or what to taste?  
**[0:31:13-0:31:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:31:13):**  What would you tell them to how to influence or nudge that mentality?  
**[0:31:18-0:31:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:31:18):**  How can we get them to be open to think differently?  
**[0:31:22-0:31:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:31:22):**  Unfortunately, I think the fastest way is just to mention, you know, a wallet.  
**[0:31:30-0:31:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:31:30):**  Because you know, sustainability nowadays, it's also an investment opportunity.  
**[0:31:34-0:31:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:31:34):**  So what do you tell them?  
**[0:31:35-0:31:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:31:35):**  You tell them like, look, it makes more sense economically?  
**[0:31:40-0:31:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:31:40):**  Yeah, it makes more sense economically.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:31:43):**  You don't see these in the next five years, maybe, but you will see in the next 10.  
**[0:31:48-0:31:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:31:48):**  I mean, now sustainability, it's an optional choice and it's an investment opportunity.  
**[0:31:56-0:32:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:31:56):**  When will be a monetary choice won't be anymore an investment opportunity.  
**[0:32:01-0:32:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:32:01):**  It will be, you know, a needed opportunity.  
**[0:32:05-0:32:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:32:05):**  You have to do this in order to eat or to drink or to breathe, you know, a good air  
**[0:32:13-0:32:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:32:13):**  and so on.  
**[0:32:14-0:32:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:32:14):**  So you're saying it's the ideal moment.  
**[0:32:15-0:32:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:32:15):**  It's the you want to create a bit of fear of missing out a bit of FOMO of like, look,  
**[0:32:21-0:32:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:32:21):**  this is an investment opportunity now.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:32:22):**  It might take a few years, but you don't want to miss out on this wave.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:32:27):**  Yeah, I think that fear of missing out will be a good way.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:32:32):**  We have a fear of missing out in many sectors where, you know, it's there is no sense in  
**[0:32:41-0:32:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:32:41):**  order to have FOMO.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:32:43):**  But in this sector, probably the FOMO is very needed.  
**[0:32:49-0:32:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:32:49):**  And what would you do if we switch the conversation?  
**[0:32:53-0:32:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:32:53):**  You are in charge of a large investment fund, let's say a billion euros, and you can invest  
**[0:32:58-0:33:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:32:58):**  it anywhere with any length of time as well.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:33:01):**  So you don't need to be restricted to the traditional seven, eight year fund, etc.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:33:06):**  You can invest it however you like.  
**[0:33:08-0:33:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:33:08):**  What would you focus on?  
**[0:33:10-0:33:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:33:10):**  Is it the animal protein side or is maybe something completely different?  
**[0:33:14-0:33:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:33:14):**  The oceans?  
**[0:33:15-0:33:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:33:15):**  What would you focus if you are not running PASCO, but actually running this investment  
**[0:33:20-0:33:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:33:20):**  fund to put money to work in regeneration, in sustainability?  
**[0:33:24-0:33:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:33:24):**  Yeah, first of all, investing in PASCO and then probably just buying resources.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:33:31):**  I will buy fields, I will buy forestry, I will buy, you know, water resources and so  
**[0:33:40-0:33:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:33:40):**  on.  
**[0:33:41-0:33:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:33:41):**  And I would try to protect them and get the maximum from them at the same time respecting  
**[0:33:53-0:33:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:33:53):**  them.  
**[0:33:54-0:34:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:33:54):**  I mean, I think that we have to build a production and consumption system that are consistent  
**[0:34:03-0:34:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:34:03):**  with the biological systems.  
**[0:34:05-0:34:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:34:05):**  So I would like just to, you know, experiment in natural places how to produce and consume  
**[0:34:17-0:34:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:34:17):**  in a very consistency way with the natural systems.  
**[0:34:21-0:34:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:34:21):**  And would you do that in Italy or in other places?  
**[0:34:24-0:34:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:34:24):**  Where would you focus your attention?  
**[0:34:27-0:34:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:34:27):**  I think I will differentiate it.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:34:31):**  So I will do it in different places in order to have different opportunities about contingency  
**[0:34:41-0:34:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:34:41):**  in general in order to have different characteristics of soil, areas, zones and so on.  
**[0:34:48-0:34:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:34:48):**  And what would you like to experiment most with?  
**[0:34:50-0:34:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:34:50):**  Is it the animal integration?  
**[0:34:52-0:34:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:34:52):**  Is it extreme composting technology?  
**[0:34:56-0:35:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:34:56):**  Is it, I don't know, remote sensing using satellite?  
**[0:35:00-0:35:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:35:00):**  What would you, if you had unlimited resources like now, what would you experiment?  
**[0:35:04-0:35:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:35:04):**  What would be your first experiment to say, okay, what would we push on?  
**[0:35:11-0:35:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:35:11):**  Probably agroforestry.  
**[0:35:12-0:35:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:35:12):**  So you know, a place where there are at the same time trees, animals, plants, water and  
**[0:35:21-0:35:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:35:21):**  so on and try to find a balance into a system basically.  
**[0:35:26-0:35:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:35:26):**  Try to find a balance with the nature of things that surround you.  
**[0:35:32-0:35:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:35:32):**  And then I'm sorry we take your fund away, but we give you a magic wand where you can  
**[0:35:37-0:35:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:35:37):**  change one thing in the ag and food space or in the land use space or sea even.  
**[0:35:43-0:35:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:35:43):**  Of course, you can choose that.  
**[0:35:44-0:35:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:35:44):**  What would you change overnight?  
**[0:35:47-0:35:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:35:47):**  Would you take out all antibiotics from the system or all animals outside?  
**[0:35:51-0:35:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:35:51):**  We've had that answer a long time ago.  
**[0:35:52-0:35:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:35:52):**  Actually somebody mentioned that.  
**[0:35:53-0:35:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:35:53):**  I think it requires Valley Farm, one of the co-founders.  
**[0:35:57-0:36:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:35:57):**  What would you do or something completely different like food traceability on all animal  
**[0:36:02-0:36:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:36:02):**  protein or all food or CO2 labels?  
**[0:36:05-0:36:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:36:05):**  What would you, being so deep into all the sides actually, all the way down to the consumer,  
**[0:36:10-0:36:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:36:10):**  but also the big distribution and the production, if you had a magic wand, but you could only  
**[0:36:13-0:36:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:36:13):**  change one thing, what would you do?  
**[0:36:16-0:36:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:36:16):**  I think it's a compromise choice.  
**[0:36:20-0:36:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:36:20):**  In any case, this choice will have a lot of effect on the system, on society and so on.  
**[0:36:28-0:36:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:36:28):**  And I will go stronger on it and I will totally exterminate the chemical products.  
**[0:36:38-0:36:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:36:38):**  Of course, we will have low production in the next few years and maybe many crises also  
**[0:36:46-0:36:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:36:46):**  about anger and so on.  
**[0:36:49-0:36:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:36:49):**  But I think that in the long run, it will have very positive effect for the ecosystem  
**[0:36:57-0:37:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:36:57):**  in general, stopping using chemical products on groundwater and so on.  
**[0:37:04-0:37:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:37:04):**  And what is exciting for you?  
**[0:37:06-0:37:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:37:06):**  I mean, you're going from 200 or from 25 to 220 stores.  
**[0:37:11-0:37:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:37:11):**  That's pretty exciting.  
**[0:37:12-0:37:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:37:12):**  But the rest of the year, we're talking in late spring 2022.  
**[0:37:15-0:37:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:37:15):**  How does the rest of the year for PASCO look like?  
**[0:37:18-0:37:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:37:18):**  What are big milestones or things you're looking forward to and also maybe a bit scared about?  
**[0:37:23-0:37:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:37:23):**  I mean, we would like to still add value to any steps of the supply chain.  
**[0:37:30-0:37:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:37:30):**  So from the breeders, we are trying to work with institutions.  
**[0:37:34-0:37:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:37:34):**  So for instance, European Union in order to find funds in order to make the transition  
**[0:37:42-0:37:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:37:42):**  faster.  
**[0:37:44-0:37:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:37:44):**  And as I mentioned before, we would like to implement the partnership with Nofensa and  
**[0:37:52-0:37:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:37:52):**  maybe also Roomi.  
**[0:37:53-0:38:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:37:53):**  I mean, all the tools that can bring value.  
**[0:38:00-0:38:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:38:00):**  And then of course, finding more clients because more clients we have, more producers and farmers  
**[0:38:08-0:38:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:38:08):**  that we can value.  
**[0:38:10-0:38:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:38:10):**  And in the middle, we would like to build a customized software in order to bring all  
**[0:38:20-0:38:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:38:20):**  the data about the supply chain together, about transportation, about the farmers, livestock,  
**[0:38:27-0:38:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:38:27):**  pasture and so on, and try to make a life cycle assessment of the whole supply chain  
**[0:38:32-0:38:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:38:32):**  in order to understand the real impact in order, of course, to CO2 emission, but also  
**[0:38:39-0:38:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:38:39):**  to systemic benefit or malus to the system.  
**[0:38:43-0:38:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:38:43):**  So we'd like to measure the biodiversity of the environment where our farmers work, the  
**[0:38:52-0:38:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:38:52):**  quality of the soil, the quality of the water and so on.  
**[0:38:57-0:39:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:38:57):**  And we'd like to do it in blockchain if possible.  
**[0:39:01-0:39:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:39:01):**  I will definitely link it below.  
**[0:39:03-0:39:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:39:03):**  If it's out, when this is out, we did a long interview on life cycle assessments with Mariko,  
**[0:39:09-0:39:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:39:09):**  which was fascinating.  
**[0:39:10-0:39:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:39:10):**  She worked on, she's the co-author of the one that they did on white oak pastures, which  
**[0:39:14-0:39:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:39:14):**  I think is the first LCA on a multi-species farm.  
**[0:39:19-0:39:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:39:19):**  And also the first that actually did soil analysis and included the sequestration potential  
**[0:39:24-0:39:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:39:24):**  in a life cycle assessment, which is quite scary because it means until now we never  
**[0:39:27-0:39:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:39:27):**  did that.  
**[0:39:28-0:39:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:39:28):**  And we had a long discussion on the multi-species side, but also the carbon focus and probably  
**[0:39:32-0:39:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:39:32):**  a bit too much focus on carbon and also on the emission side and what needs to happen,  
**[0:39:38-0:39:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:39:38):**  let's say to make them much more robust and much stronger because they only tell half  
**[0:39:42-0:39:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:39:42):**  of the story at the moment.  
**[0:39:44-0:39:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:39:44):**  And the other half is either based on very old models or based on data that we simply  
**[0:39:50-0:39:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:39:50):**  don't have.  
**[0:39:51-0:39:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:39:51):**  I will link below.  
**[0:39:52-0:39:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:39:52):**  So the roomy, which is interesting to find out obviously more and no fence, virtual fencing  
**[0:39:57-0:39:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:39:57):**  side of things.  
**[0:39:58-0:40:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:39:58):**  So I think there's a lot to do.  
**[0:40:00-0:40:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:40:00):**  And is that the story that as the last question, is that the limiting factor at the moment  
**[0:40:03-0:40:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:40:03):**  the amount of customers you have or because if you had more customers, you could easily  
**[0:40:08-0:40:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:40:08):**  scale up with more of your farmers, like there's more space there.  
**[0:40:12-0:40:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:40:12):**  Or is it also a limitation of finding the farmers or you say, no, that's there.  
**[0:40:16-0:40:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:40:16):**  We have enough space, enough animals, enough growth, easy growth, let's say.  
**[0:40:21-0:40:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:40:21):**  The main limitation nowadays are about operation because, you know, it's not a software is  
**[0:40:27-0:40:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:40:27):**  a real life supply chain.  
**[0:40:30-0:40:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:40:30):**  So it's not that needs to be fresh.  
**[0:40:32-0:40:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:40:32):**  Otherwise it's the case.  
**[0:40:33-0:40:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:40:33):**  Yeah, there is a it's not that you're selling almonds that are dry and you're fine or software.  
**[0:40:38-0:40:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:40:38):**  Like you said, you're selling something that is literally alive.  
**[0:40:43-0:40:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:40:43):**  And we are, you know, working also through many geopolitical contingency, for instance,  
**[0:40:51-0:40:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:40:51):**  you know, the pandemic and the war, the price of raw materials went up a lot in the last  
**[0:40:58-0:41:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:40:58):**  six months, basically.  
**[0:41:00-0:41:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:41:00):**  So we had a very big problem about packaging because our package is out cartoon and how  
**[0:41:09-0:41:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:41:09):**  to and it's both recyclable, of course.  
**[0:41:15-0:41:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:41:15):**  But we bought around 3000 carton.  
**[0:41:18-0:41:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:41:18):**  And you say carton boxes, boxes, right.  
**[0:41:24-0:41:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:41:24):**  And they were not working, basically.  
**[0:41:28-0:41:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:41:28):**  So we lost a couple of months with clients such as scope and others because we couldn't  
**[0:41:36-0:41:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:41:36):**  package the meat.  
**[0:41:38-0:41:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:41:38):**  And the packaging industry, the cardboard is very difficult to get hold of.  
**[0:41:41-0:41:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:41:41):**  Yeah, no, it's not.  
**[0:41:42-0:41:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:41:42):**  It's not a software that you can just switch on a few servers at Amazon and you're fine.  
**[0:41:46-0:41:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:41:46):**  And at one time you have a lot of producer and not so many clients.  
**[0:41:53-0:41:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:41:53):**  Then one week later, you have too many clients, not so many producer.  
**[0:41:57-0:42:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:41:57):**  And you have to keep a balance, you know, growing.  
**[0:42:01-0:42:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:42:01):**  It's very, very difficult because you have to be always in balance and at the same time  
**[0:42:07-0:42:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:42:07):**  growing month per month.  
**[0:42:10-0:42:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:42:10):**  So is that what you enjoy?  
**[0:42:11-0:42:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:42:11):**  You mentioned at the beginning that I like to create things that are not there.  
**[0:42:14-0:42:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:42:14):**  You're smiling a lot now.  
**[0:42:15-0:42:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:42:15):**  You cannot see that on the you cannot hear that now.  
**[0:42:18-0:42:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:42:18):**  Maybe you can actually.  
**[0:42:19-0:42:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:42:19):**  Is that what you enjoy or is it also uncomfortable at some point?  
**[0:42:22-0:42:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:42:22):**  Yeah, I love our uncertainty.  
**[0:42:25-0:42:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:42:25):**  I mean, I don't like things routine and otherwise it would have worked at a bank in Milan.  
**[0:42:34-0:42:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:42:34):**  Yeah, yeah, I will do something else, of course.  
**[0:42:39-0:42:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:42:39):**  And so.  
**[0:42:42-0:42:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:42:42):**  Do you see with this crisis?  
**[0:42:43-0:42:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:42:43):**  I mean, I keep saying last question, but with these crises on pricing, et cetera, and prices  
**[0:42:48-0:42:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:42:48):**  of inputs, in many cases, I think people have seen the crazy fertilizer prices already last  
**[0:42:54-0:42:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:42:54):**  year and now, of course, with the war even more.  
**[0:42:57-0:43:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:42:57):**  Do you see like differences in the low input farmers you work with and let's say the high,  
**[0:43:05-0:43:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:43:05):**  high, high input ones like other prices getting closer to each other in the supermarkets?  
**[0:43:09-0:43:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:43:09):**  Do you see any of that yet?  
**[0:43:10-0:43:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:43:10):**  Like prices are being changed?  
**[0:43:12-0:43:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:43:12):**  Do you see the of less because for instance, wildfarm that talk to recently, they say,  
**[0:43:17-0:43:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:43:17):**  yeah, we use so little inputs that we are, of course, we're suffering because electricity  
**[0:43:21-0:43:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:43:21):**  and petrol and other things are packaging, but it's not the raw like the input input  
**[0:43:26-0:43:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:43:26):**  prices for us.  
**[0:43:27-0:43:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:43:27):**  We don't have so much of that.  
**[0:43:28-0:43:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:43:28):**  So we're less suffering than our competitors.  
**[0:43:29-0:43:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:43:29):**  And maybe finally, the prices of bread are getting close to each other of the low input  
**[0:43:35-0:43:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:43:35):**  ones.  
**[0:43:36-0:43:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:43:36):**  Do you see that as well?  
**[0:43:37-0:43:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:43:37):**  Or is that too early?  
**[0:43:38-0:43:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:43:38):**  Yeah, I think that's a very interesting thing because, you know, our supply chain is very  
**[0:43:43-0:43:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:43:43):**  self sufficient.  
**[0:43:45-0:43:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:43:45):**  Also in production of raw materials such as cereals.  
**[0:43:49-0:43:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:43:49):**  Of course, our cows are raised extensively.  
**[0:43:52-0:43:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:43:52):**  So the amount of cereals they eat, it's very, very small.  
**[0:43:56-0:44:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:43:56):**  It's like about the 20% of the total ratio of the nutrition of the cow.  
**[0:44:02-0:44:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:44:02):**  And all these cereals are basically all made in the farms, GMO free and so on.  
**[0:44:11-0:44:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:44:11):**  And in the conventional beef supply chain, the amount of cereals that the cows eat, it's  
**[0:44:20-0:44:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:44:20):**  around the 80%.  
**[0:44:21-0:44:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:44:21):**  That's four times.  
**[0:44:22-0:44:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:44:22):**  So we go from 20 to 80.  
**[0:44:25-0:44:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:44:25):**  Just for your calculation.  
**[0:44:26-0:44:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:44:26):**  And they're not they're not growing on the farm itself, for sure.  
**[0:44:30-0:44:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:44:30):**  It's the opposite.  
**[0:44:32-0:44:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:44:32):**  And these supply chains are very dependent about importing cereals, for instance, from  
**[0:44:39-0:44:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:44:39):**  Russia, Ukraine, and so on.  
**[0:44:43-0:44:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:44:43):**  And in this case, you know, when there is a war and a problem about raw material in general,  
**[0:44:49-0:44:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:44:49):**  these prices go up a lot.  
**[0:44:52-0:44:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:44:52):**  And the price of, you know, conventional meat at the supermarket went pretty much close  
**[0:44:59-0:45:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:44:59):**  to our meat.  
**[0:45:00-0:45:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:45:00):**  So you pay basically the same for a product that it's completely different.  
**[0:45:07-0:45:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:45:07):**  That's fascinating.  
**[0:45:08-0:45:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:45:08):**  Do you see that?  
**[0:45:09-0:45:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:45:09):**  Do you see I mean, you're in relatively small supermarkets, but do you see now that that  
**[0:45:13-0:45:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:45:13):**  helps like in terms of sales?  
**[0:45:15-0:45:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:45:15):**  And maybe also in general, the whole discussion on this self sufficiency and food sovereignty  
**[0:45:20-0:45:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:45:20):**  and should we import a lot of stuff?  
**[0:45:22-0:45:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:45:22):**  I know in many European countries, it has been a big discussion on fertilizer on grain  
**[0:45:27-0:45:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:45:27):**  and wheat, etc.  
**[0:45:28-0:45:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:45:28):**  Do you have you seen an uptick since the beginning of the year in terms of in terms of sales?  
**[0:45:32-0:45:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:45:32):**  Or is it very difficult to see?  
**[0:45:35-0:45:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:45:35):**  As you said, we are still in so few supermarkets.  
**[0:45:39-0:45:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:45:39):**  So I think we'll see it in the next year, in the next few years.  
**[0:45:46-0:45:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:45:46):**  And that's the reason why I was suggesting to investors to invest in this way.  
**[0:45:54-0:46:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:45:54):**  Because this is an example of how, you know, a good supply chain for the system.  
**[0:46:01-0:46:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:46:01):**  It's also good for the for the wallet for the investors, because, you know, one of our  
**[0:46:09-0:46:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:46:09):**  goals is to build a totally sufficient supply chain.  
**[0:46:16-0:46:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:46:16):**  So without anything imported or exported outside the supply chain.  
**[0:46:24-0:46:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:46:24):**  It's a very interesting.  
**[0:46:27-0:46:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:46:27):**  You protect a lot yourself from whatever happens in the world.  
**[0:46:32-0:46:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:46:32):**  Yeah, communities, you know, it's a I think many people underestimate how many madness,  
**[0:46:38-0:46:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:46:38):**  madness, disease, there's a lot there.  
**[0:46:43-0:46:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:46:43):**  And I want to be conscious of your time as well and look forward to speak to you in the  
**[0:46:49-0:46:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:46:49):**  future and see how far you got and what kind of very interesting experiments and larger  
**[0:46:54-0:46:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:46:54):**  than experiments you have been implementing.  
**[0:46:56-0:46:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:46:56):**  So I want to thank you so much for your time, Federico, today.

**[0:47:04-0:47:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:47:04):**  I think it's a nine billion euro Italian beef market, which is a bit of space to grow.  
**[0:47:10-0:47:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:47:10):**  Yeah, maybe 7.5, but you know, still so big.  
**[0:47:15-0:47:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:47:15):**  Still enormous.

**[0:48:06-0:48:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:48:06):**  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[0:48:10-0:48:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:48:10):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  
**[0:48:14-0:48:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:48:14):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[0:48:16-0:48:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:48:16):**  There are 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question how to  
**[0:48:20-0:48:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:48:20):**  put money to work in regenerating soils.  
**[0:48:22-0:48:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:48:22):**  And I've been following the space since 2011 and recording these podcasts since 2016.  
**[0:48:27-0:48:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:48:27):**  We thought it was time to share our lessons learned.

**[0:49:07-0:49:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:49:07):**  People that are building soil at scale.  
**[0:49:10-0:49:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:49:10):**  And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office  
**[0:49:13-0:49:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:49:13):**  or as private individuals or people who are putting other people's money to work through

**[0:49:23-0:49:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:49:23):**  No.  
**[0:49:24-0:49:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:49:24):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:49:27-0:49:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:49:27):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you and I'm very aware  
**[0:49:32-0:49:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:49:32):**  that among the listeners of this podcast we have people with very different means.  
**[0:49:36-0:49:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:49:36):**  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[0:49:41-0:49:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:49:41):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[0:49:44-0:49:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:49:44):**  Thank you.  
**[0:49:45-0:49:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:49:45):**  So what is this course?  
**[0:49:46-0:49:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:49:46):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  
**[0:49:53-0:49:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:49:53):**  so you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:49:55-0:50:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:49:55):**  We're gonna look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:50:00-0:50:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:50:00):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:50:05-0:50:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:50:05):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[0:50:10-0:50:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:50:10):**  if you're a soy builder.  
**[0:50:11-0:50:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:50:11):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:50:16-0:50:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:50:16):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:50:20-0:50:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:50:20):**  We're gonna look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:50:25-0:50:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:50:25):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:50:26-0:50:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:50:26):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:50:28-0:50:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:50:28):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:50:30-0:50:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:50:30):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:50:34-0:50:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:50:34):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:50:36-0:50:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:50:36):**  Before making any investment please find professional investment advice.  
**[0:50:41-0:50:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/federico-romeri#t=0:50:41):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking.

**[0:00:42-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:00:42):**  people, local communities and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:49-0:00:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:00:49):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:51-0:00:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:00:51):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:00:55-0:01:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:00:55):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat and it's time that we as investors big and small  
**[0:01:00-0:01:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:01:00):**  and consumers start paying much more attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.

**[0:01:52-0:01:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:01:52):**  Welcome Matt and Mark.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:01:53):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:54-0:01:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:01:54):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:55-0:01:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:01:55):**  And to start with a personal question I always like to ask to both of you actually, what  
**[0:01:58-0:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:01:58):**  led you into being part of Planet Tracker, finding Planet Tracker and working on these  
**[0:02:03-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:02:03):**  extremely large land use and also sea use actually industries.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:02:07):**  So from my point of view, I trained as an agricultural economist about 30, 32, 33 years  
**[0:02:14-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:02:14):**  ago and I did my master's thesis on environmental cost accounting techniques.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:02:19):**  It's quite, quite dry, but what I was trying to work out is if you factored in natural  
**[0:02:25-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:02:25):**  capital into the way you did project evaluation as an investor, how would it return, how would  
**[0:02:30-0:02:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:02:30):**  it change the return on investment and could you reduce the inputs like chemical inputs  
**[0:02:36-0:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:02:36):**  in favor of natural inputs by valuing nature better?  
**[0:02:39-0:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:02:39):**  I never thought I'd find a way of using that degree, that master's degree, but I ended  
**[0:02:44-0:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:02:44):**  up going into the city, into finance and what I realized is that financial markets are very  
**[0:02:50-0:02:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:02:50):**  sophisticated whether equity markets or debt markets, but they're not actually that good  
**[0:02:56-0:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:02:56):**  at understanding planetary limits.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:02:58):**  So there's no real pricing mechanism for air, for water quality, for even the land in which  
**[0:03:06-0:03:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:03:06):**  we depend for food production.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:03:09):**  And so there's no real proper value of that.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:03:12):**  So it struck me that we've got to work out the tools to think about this.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:03:17):**  And there's a lot of academic work around natural capital.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:03:20):**  There's some fantastic work done by people like Sukhdev on natural capital and the UN  
**[0:03:27-0:03:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:03:27):**  and others talk about it and economists talk about it, but it isn't really properly understood  
**[0:03:32-0:03:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:03:32):**  through the lens of financial markets.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:03:34):**  So I set up Planet Tracker with my good friend, Nick Robbins, who's a professor of sustainable  
**[0:03:41-0:03:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:03:41):**  finance at the London School of Economics.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:03:44):**  And Nick and I set it up really just to try and address this.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:03:47):**  So what it means simply is that we look at, we try and look at all the fisheries and seafood  
**[0:03:54-0:03:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:03:54):**  companies that are listed on stock exchanges around the world.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:03:57):**  And we try and look at say water businesses and forestry businesses and food and agricultural  
**[0:04:02-0:04:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:04:02):**  production businesses.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:04:04):**  And how do markets value those companies and do they incorporate planetary boundaries and  
**[0:04:11-0:04:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:04:11):**  do they understand the value of natural capital?  
**[0:04:13-0:04:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:04:13):**  And what are the constraints in the future?  
**[0:04:17-0:04:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:04:17):**  And what would this mean for business models?  
**[0:04:19-0:04:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:04:19):**  So that was the reason why I set up Planet Tracker.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:04:22):**  And I was delighted that we've been supported by some terrific foundations that allowed  
**[0:04:28-0:04:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:04:28):**  me to meet what are now great colleagues like Matt and Robin and the rest of the team that  
**[0:04:33-0:04:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:04:33):**  form the heart of Planet Tracker.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:04:36):**  Brilliant.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:04:37):**  Thanks, Mark.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:04:38):**  So my story is somewhat different, a bit like Mark.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:04:42):**  I started my career within the city, within finance, working for a large institutional  
**[0:04:49-0:04:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:04:49):**  Swiss bank.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:04:51):**  And I realized that actually within that bank, they were launching a series of research pieces  
**[0:04:59-0:05:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:04:59):**  around the new paradigm shift of where capital markets would be deploying large scale funding  
**[0:05:06-0:05:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:05:06):**  in the future.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:05:08):**  And this was in around 2005.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:05:11):**  And those themes really, they resonated with my personal feelings about the environment  
**[0:05:18-0:05:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:05:18):**  and about the planet and looking at the sustainability of water, sustainability of agriculture systems,  
**[0:05:25-0:05:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:05:25):**  the sustainability of food systems and consumer trends.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:05:29):**  And really whilst the research was extremely compelling, there was very little financial  
**[0:05:35-0:05:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:05:35):**  product available in the marketplace to actually enable investors to support the sustainability  
**[0:05:42-0:05:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:05:42):**  trends or these mega trends.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:05:44):**  And I actually spent 10 years managing conservation finance funds and setting up conservation  
**[0:05:52-0:05:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:05:52):**  finance funds mainly in Africa and also in Europe.  
**[0:05:56-0:06:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:05:56):**  And through investing in businesses that were really at the forefront of driving sustainability  
**[0:06:02-0:06:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:06:02):**  and specifically around landscapes, around biodiversity, we realized that these businesses  
**[0:06:08-0:06:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:06:08):**  were facing some pretty simple barriers for scaling and that in order to actually generate  
**[0:06:17-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:06:17):**  the 300 billion or so dollars worth of conservation finance required to conserve the planet's  
**[0:06:23-0:06:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:06:23):**  natural landscapes, we had to engage capital markets.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:06:27):**  And so with that sort of view, I came back into the city to join Planet Tracker to really  
**[0:06:35-0:06:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:06:35):**  look at how we can leverage capital markets in terms of asset managers and asset owners.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:06:44):**  So we're looking at pension funds, we're looking at large scale insurance based investors.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:06:50):**  We're looking at the asset managers as custodians of their money and their investment decision  
**[0:06:56-0:07:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:06:56):**  making and looking at how they engage companies and can support companies to operate more  
**[0:07:00-0:07:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:07:00):**  sustainably.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:07:02):**  And so through that and through the lens of both equities and also fixed income, we are  
**[0:07:08-0:07:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:07:08):**  hoping to really shift the dial in how capital markets deploy their money, how capital markets  
**[0:07:15-0:07:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:07:15):**  research and value risk and return and really start looking at generating significant amounts  
**[0:07:22-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:07:22):**  of funding for the environment and for sustainability globally.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:07:26):**  It's extremely interesting.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:07:29):**  Thank you for both of your introductions.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:07:31):**  And as in the podcast, we mostly look at, I would say the positive side or the potential  
**[0:07:35-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:07:35):**  of agriculture and land use and sea use and the restoration of soils, etc.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:07:40):**  But I think the risk side of things and the current degeneration of most of natural capital  
**[0:07:46-0:07:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:07:46):**  is something we don't discuss often enough.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:07:49):**  So what is something that, I mean, you've been around for not very long, actually, I  
**[0:07:54-0:07:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:07:54):**  think a year or two.  
**[0:07:55-0:08:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:07:55):**  The first report was actually published about three years ago, two and a half years ago.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:08:02):**  And that was Fish Tracker.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:08:03):**  So originally after I created Carbon Tracker, which is the climate focused and non-profit,  
**[0:08:10-0:08:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:08:10):**  I began to start thinking about seafood.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:08:13):**  And the trigger was finding a Chinese seafood company listed on the London Stock Exchange,  
**[0:08:19-0:08:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:08:19):**  which I thought was fascinating that we think the problems are located on the other side  
**[0:08:24-0:08:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:08:24):**  of the world.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:08:25):**  And you don't have to look too far to discover actually from a financial point of view, they're  
**[0:08:29-0:08:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:08:29):**  often based on our hometown.  
**[0:08:31-0:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:08:31):**  So we did a piece of analysis to say how many seafood companies are there listed on the  
**[0:08:36-0:08:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:08:36):**  world stock markets.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:08:37):**  And we found some 227, which came as a bit of a surprise to a lot of people because that's  
**[0:08:43-0:08:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:08:43):**  actually quite a few companies involved in fisheries, catching wild fish, and so on.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:08:49):**  And so that was the first report.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:08:51):**  And what we concluded was that there are far more boats out there trying to chase the fish  
**[0:08:58-0:09:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:08:58):**  than there are fish and can be caught within a sustainable basis.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:09:04):**  And that equity capital markets were central to how these companies were being financed.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:09:10):**  And so after the success of the launch of Fish Tracker, I decided we would absorb it  
**[0:09:15-0:09:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:09:15):**  into Planet Tracker.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:09:17):**  And then Planet Tracker in turn would develop programs around textiles and water and food  
**[0:09:22-0:09:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:09:22):**  and agriculture.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:09:23):**  And so that's really the genesis of it.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:09:25):**  But I've got to say, we didn't really get going until Robin Millington and Matt McLuckie  
**[0:09:31-0:09:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:09:31):**  here joined and allowed us to build the team.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:09:35):**  And now we're motoring along at a good pace with a lot of ambition for what we can do,  
**[0:09:41-0:09:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:09:41):**  just because a lot of this research just hasn't been done.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:09:44):**  The research report that we launched today on shrimps, there are 27 stock exchange listed  
**[0:09:53-0:10:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:09:53):**  shrimp farming businesses that are owned by household name insurance companies and investors.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:10:00):**  People listening to your podcast today will probably have these companies in their pension  
**[0:10:06-0:10:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:10:06):**  fund, typically.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:10:08):**  And so we're the first- Without knowing, obviously.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:10:10):**  Yeah, no, they wouldn't know.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:10:11):**  And doing this kind of analysis, I think the ESG sustainability industry is a huge industry  
**[0:10:19-0:10:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:10:19):**  now employing thousands of people around the world.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:10:21):**  But there's still some new frontiers of unknown, undone research.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:10:25):**  And I think this new shrimp paper is just an example of that.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:10:29):**  Would you agree, Matt?  
**[0:10:30-0:10:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:10:30):**  No, I definitely agree.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:10:32):**  And part of what we do is when we look at, for example, the global food supply chain  
**[0:10:39-0:10:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:10:39):**  and actually the integrated value chains is that often capital markets aren't necessarily  
**[0:10:44-0:10:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:10:44):**  aware that they're exposed to some of these companies.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:10:47):**  And there's a low degree of transparency through which these companies are operating in terms  
**[0:10:53-0:10:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:10:53):**  of how they report to capital markets.  
**[0:10:55-0:11:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:10:55):**  And a company which actually offers a very good example, but also is a good example of  
**[0:11:02-0:11:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:11:02):**  strong sustainability in terms of their reporting and actually what they're trying to do in  
**[0:11:07-0:11:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:11:07):**  terms of moving the dial of how they report to capital markets is a group such as Mitsubishi.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:11:13):**  Mitsubishi is such a large global corporation and they produce a whole swathe of different  
**[0:11:19-0:11:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:11:19):**  products from white goods to electric vehicles to renewable energy technology.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:11:24):**  But they're also one of the largest fishing companies in the world and controlling a fleet  
**[0:11:29-0:11:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:11:29):**  of vessels as well as processing operators as well as distribution companies.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:11:34):**  So I think it's important to actually just educate capital markets around actually what  
**[0:11:39-0:11:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:11:39):**  companies in their portfolios are doing across the world when it comes to the environment  
**[0:11:46-0:11:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:11:46):**  and actually how they can work with managers of those companies to create more sustainable  
**[0:11:53-0:11:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:11:53):**  management of resources.  
**[0:11:55-0:12:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:11:55):**  And a very good example of that, I think, stems from some later work that we published  
**[0:12:01-0:12:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:12:01):**  at the back half of last year in Japan, where, excuse me, out of the 228 global listed fishing  
**[0:12:12-0:12:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:12:12):**  companies, we know that approximately 41 of them are domiciled in Japan.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:12:18):**  And what we've seen with Japan is that actually in terms of total fish production within their  
**[0:12:24-0:12:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:12:24):**  wildcatched seafood industry, production peaked in the mid 1980s.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:12:29):**  So in 1985, Japan was producing around 12.5 million tons worth of seafood every year.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:12:36):**  In 2017, that number had dropped to 3.3 million.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:12:40):**  So you're roughly, you're looking at a discount of over two thirds or decline in over two  
**[0:12:45-0:12:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:12:45):**  thirds in terms of total production.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:12:49):**  What we've also seen, however, though, is that if Japanese fisheries alone were managed  
**[0:12:53-0:13:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:12:53):**  more sustainably, it would generate an extra 5.5 billion dollars in terms of fishing revenue.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:13:00):**  And so and if you extrapolate that number out on a global basis, the FAO have said that  
**[0:13:04-0:13:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:13:04):**  if global fisheries were managed to achieve maximum sustainable yield, it would be worth  
**[0:13:09-0:13:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:13:09):**  an extra 51 billion dollars to global economies, so to the industry.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:13:14):**  And so what we're actually finding is that there is a direct financial incentives for  
**[0:13:19-0:13:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:13:19):**  portfolio managers to actually start engaging with companies within their portfolio to operate  
**[0:13:25-0:13:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:13:25):**  more sustainably because this represents it's not downside risk.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:13:29):**  This is opportunity upside.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:13:31):**  And that's an important feature that Planetracker likes to sort of that distinguishes us and  
**[0:13:37-0:13:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:13:37):**  that we are looking for the positive upside approach with these companies and the solutions  
**[0:13:42-0:13:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:13:42):**  for the finance community to actually engage companies on.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:13:45):**  Yeah, I think it's extremely interesting that you make that switch from risk to opportunity.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:13:50):**  And something you said before, Mark, and I was actually mad, like they're more, they're  
**[0:13:55-0:14:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:13:55):**  more fishing vessels chasing than they are actually fish to catch at the moment as they're  
**[0:14:00-0:14:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:14:00):**  not managed.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:14:01):**  Most of the fisheries are not managed sustainably.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:14:03):**  That's something that I think not only is a huge risk, if you suddenly find out like,  
**[0:14:08-0:14:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:14:08):**  look, if we have all these companies chasing the same fish, probably that's not going to  
**[0:14:12-0:14:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:14:12):**  work out.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:14:13):**  But it's something very similar to think of the carbon tracker, sorry, which is obviously  
**[0:14:16-0:14:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:14:16):**  a lot older, like there, there's more coal, or there's more CO2, or there's there's a  
**[0:14:21-0:14:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:14:21):**  lot of stuff we cannot burn.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:14:23):**  And is that that's not a coincidence that that's the same, basically, that it is interesting  
**[0:14:28-0:14:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:14:28):**  that nobody ever did that research, like, how much do we actually have?  
**[0:14:31-0:14:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:14:31):**  How much is on the balance sheet?  
**[0:14:32-0:14:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:14:32):**  And how much fish are we tracking or fishing?  
**[0:14:34-0:14:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:14:34):**  Or how much carbon are we trying to burn?  
**[0:14:36-0:14:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:14:36):**  These are good points.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:14:37):**  And we're still trying to some of this, which we're still trying to figure out.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:14:40):**  I remember in the early 90s, when I first started thinking about this, I was looking  
**[0:14:46-0:14:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:14:46):**  at some stock exchange, forestry logging companies that were logging tropical forests in Asia.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:14:54):**  And there was a particular company...  
**[0:14:56-0:14:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:14:56):**  Let me get to the same.  
**[0:14:57-0:15:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:14:57):**  Yeah, well, I tell you what was happening was that the investors were valuing the company  
**[0:15:02-0:15:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:15:02):**  on a price earnings multiple.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:15:04):**  So they were saying that this year, they generated 10 million in revenue, say, for example, next  
**[0:15:09-0:15:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:15:09):**  year is 15 million, the following year is 20 million.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:15:12):**  And they were valuing on a price earnings multiple, sort of giving the indication that  
**[0:15:16-0:15:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:15:16):**  actually the best way to come up with a value of the company is to sort of say these cash  
**[0:15:21-0:15:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:15:21):**  flows are growing and it will continue to grow in the future.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:15:25):**  So it's got to be a really valuable company.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:15:27):**  Now what they didn't know, and this was where the interesting thing came in, is that the  
**[0:15:31-0:15:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:15:31):**  logging company was taking a quarter of the commercial trees out of the forest each year.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:15:37):**  So after year four, there were no more commercial logs, the forest was trashed.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:15:42):**  And so you couldn't use a PE price earnings multiple.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:15:45):**  So this analyst came out of the report and said, well, actually, this is all an illusion  
**[0:15:50-0:15:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:15:50):**  of number work that you've got to evaluate on a sort of depletion play where you're sort  
**[0:15:56-0:16:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:15:56):**  of saying, okay, each year you're removing 25% of the value each year.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:16:01):**  And at the end of year four, there are no more revenues.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:16:05):**  So this analyst, I remember, she put this sell side note out with a new valuation that  
**[0:16:10-0:16:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:16:10):**  essentially said, instead of the stock price being $20, it's going to be six.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:16:15):**  And pandemonium broke loose because the investors suddenly realized that after year four, this  
**[0:16:21-0:16:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:16:21):**  particular business was going to have no more revenues from logging forest because they'd  
**[0:16:25-0:16:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:16:25):**  logged out the forest.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:16:27):**  And it very neatly told a story that markets discount future cash flows, but they are unable  
**[0:16:32-0:16:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:16:32):**  properly to price scarcity of natural resources.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:16:36):**  And we use the wrong methodologies.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:16:39):**  So if you look at, say, seafood, investors assume, we hear this phrase, there's plenty  
**[0:16:44-0:16:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:16:44):**  more fish in the sea.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:16:46):**  Our grandmothers were using that phrase.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:16:48):**  Well, I'm afraid, folks, that's no longer true.  
**[0:16:51-0:16:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:16:51):**  There aren't plenty more fish in the sea because we've been taking a lot of it out.  
**[0:16:55-0:16:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:16:55):**  And investors have this strange assumption that you take one fish, there's going to be  
**[0:16:59-0:17:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:16:59):**  plenty more there next year.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:17:01):**  And if you build one boat to catch fish, if you build 10 boats, you can catch 10 times  
**[0:17:06-0:17:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:17:06):**  as much fish without realizing that you hit these boundaries.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:17:11):**  And really the heart of Planet Tracker and its research and its approach is really to  
**[0:17:15-0:17:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:17:15):**  sort of say, well, look, we can't run the world thinking along these lines.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:17:20):**  Markets have to change.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:17:22):**  Investment analytics have to change.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:17:24):**  How we model risk has to change.  
**[0:17:28-0:17:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:17:28):**  And ultimately, consumers and investors and the companies themselves have to rethink this.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:17:34):**  And we've got to stop this plundering of the oceans and plundering of the atmosphere.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:17:39):**  And investors, normally quite conservative people.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:17:43):**  And if we measured risk better and we put in place better practices, then a lot of this,  
**[0:17:48-0:17:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:17:48):**  the problem is not going to go away.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:17:50):**  I think we would find better ways of dealing with the sustainability challenge.  
**[0:17:56-0:17:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:17:56):**  I really like the switch to you.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:17:58):**  We are not modeling or we are as a species not modeling in scarcity.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:18:01):**  And we sort of saw the forest.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:18:03):**  Now hopefully that changed.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:18:04):**  But solar forest is an endless amount of trees and the sea is still the sea as an endless  
**[0:18:08-0:18:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:18:08):**  amount of fish because we don't really see how many are actually down there.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:18:11):**  Probably we get really, really scared.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:18:13):**  What you did to model, like how much of decline we actually already hit.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:18:17):**  We just put more boats and more boats and more boats.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:18:20):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:18:21):**  Exactly.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:18:22):**  And what we found in the meetings that we've done with different investment firms and we've  
**[0:18:28-0:18:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:18:28):**  met with some large pension funds and we've met with a number of investment managers is  
**[0:18:32-0:18:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:18:32):**  a lot of people are getting this.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:18:33):**  I think there has been a change in thinking in the last five, 10 years.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:18:39):**  A lot more analysts, a lot more investors are getting it.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:18:42):**  I think it's true, particularly of Europe, particularly of the Scandinavian countries  
**[0:18:48-0:18:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:18:48):**  and say the Netherlands.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:18:50):**  I wouldn't say it was especially well known in Asia or perhaps North America, but it's  
**[0:18:57-0:18:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:18:57):**  growing awareness in Europe.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:18:59):**  And the good thing about the internet and communications is we can begin to distribute  
**[0:19:04-0:19:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:19:04):**  this research further afield and where we can, we try and publish in local languages  
**[0:19:09-0:19:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:19:09):**  to allow a pickup of the analysis.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:19:12):**  And we see this educational thing is going to take some time, but we've got some things.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:19:18):**  We've got some tools that work in our favor.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:19:20):**  So one of the things that does interest us is, is can we get stock exchanges to require  
**[0:19:26-0:19:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:19:26):**  a better disclosures by listed companies?  
**[0:19:29-0:19:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:19:29):**  So if you want to raise money to log a forest or to build boats to go fishing, do you properly  
**[0:19:36-0:19:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:19:36):**  disclose the sustainability profiles of the fisheries you operate in or the forest you  
**[0:19:42-0:19:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:19:42):**  log in?  
**[0:19:43-0:19:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:19:43):**  And can you present sustainable forestry management plans or resource management plans?  
**[0:19:48-0:19:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:19:48):**  And there's a role there for good regulation and good disclosure and a good accounting  
**[0:19:52-0:19:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:19:52):**  systems.  
**[0:19:54-0:20:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:19:54):**  And I also added to that, one of the key tools that we're seeing huge leaps and bounds in  
**[0:20:00-0:20:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:20:00):**  is the availability of high quality environmental data and the translation of that data into  
**[0:20:07-0:20:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:20:07):**  metrics that capital markets can actually use.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:20:11):**  And there's some incredible companies such as Planet Labs who are a satellite data provider  
**[0:20:16-0:20:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:20:16):**  who now we can start looking at soil profiling at a very granular level.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:20:21):**  We can start looking at water at a very granular level and start determining how when you've  
**[0:20:27-0:20:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:20:27):**  got agricultural companies that rely on soil productivity, when you've got brewery companies  
**[0:20:33-0:20:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:20:33):**  that rely on the availability of clean water, we can actually start modeling and pricing  
**[0:20:40-0:20:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:20:40):**  in the short to medium term actually how the availability of that natural capital is trending  
**[0:20:47-0:20:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:20:47):**  and start working with companies to ensure that they can maintain the sustainability  
**[0:20:52-0:20:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:20:52):**  of those resources.  
**[0:20:54-0:21:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:20:54):**  And so I think capital markets are, they've got more tools at the disposable than they've  
**[0:21:00-0:21:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:21:00):**  ever had to be able to look at valuations in a new way.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:21:05):**  I think where capital markets actually need to do maybe more work is the education of  
**[0:21:09-0:21:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:21:09):**  analysts, the education of our portfolio managers and asset owners around how to use those tools  
**[0:21:17-0:21:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:21:17):**  and fundamentally to look at the metrics.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:21:20):**  And these, we're talking about economic fundamental metrics and how does the environment  
**[0:21:26-0:21:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:21:26):**  interrelate with those metrics?  
**[0:21:28-0:21:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:21:28):**  So we've launched a paper, for example, looking at balance of payments, which is a key metric  
**[0:21:35-0:21:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:21:35):**  in determining sovereign credit risk.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:21:38):**  And just looking at how the production of soft commodities in the country and those  
**[0:21:44-0:21:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:21:44):**  that production relies on the availability of soil, of water, et cetera, how that actually  
**[0:21:49-0:21:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:21:49):**  impacts the production of commodities, which has a subsequent impact on balance of payments.  
**[0:21:54-0:21:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:21:54):**  And so we can be looking at these linkages and actually starting to educate analysts  
**[0:21:59-0:22:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:21:59):**  and working with analysts on how they can start pricing environmental externalities  
**[0:22:04-0:22:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:22:04):**  and natural capital values into their research.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:22:06):**  Yeah, I actually want to do that.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:22:09):**  It's a great bridge to the project you're doing in sovereign bonds.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:22:11):**  Can you unpack that a bit?  
**[0:22:12-0:22:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:22:12):**  I would definitely link all the information below in the show notes, but can you unpack  
**[0:22:17-0:22:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:22:17):**  a bit what it means in practice?  
**[0:22:19-0:22:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:22:19):**  You've looked mostly at Latin America, if I remember correctly, and really tried to  
**[0:22:23-0:22:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:22:23):**  make the connection between the natural assets or natural capital that these countries have  
**[0:22:28-0:22:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:22:28):**  and basically their expert focus sector on the agriculture and the risks there.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:22:32):**  But can you unpack a bit for people when that are not immediately thinking, oh, these are  
**[0:22:36-0:22:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:22:36):**  sovereign bonds, how that works and what the research is that you've done there or the  
**[0:22:39-0:22:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:22:39):**  project that you're doing, because it's a much longer one.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:22:42):**  Yeah, so very simply, we're working on a joint project with the Grantham Institute of the  
**[0:22:47-0:22:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:22:47):**  London School of Economics to look at the connection between the environment's natural  
**[0:22:52-0:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:22:52):**  capital and essentially sovereign bond risk.  
**[0:22:56-0:23:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:22:56):**  And primarily we're looking at credit defaults and interest rate risks and using funding  
**[0:23:04-0:23:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:23:04):**  provided by the Gordon Betty Moore Foundation through the finance hub.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:23:08):**  We focus our initial research on Brazil and Argentina.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:23:13):**  And let me just highlight the case of Argentina here.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:23:18):**  Argentina as we know, macroeconomically, has had a rather tempestuous recent history.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:23:24):**  And in 2018, that culminated in the International Monetary Fund, the IMF, actually issuing a  
**[0:23:30-0:23:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:23:30):**  $56 billion bailout standby agreements to the economy.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:23:36):**  So in essence, if you factor in also sovereign bond investors into Argentina, and there's  
**[0:23:42-0:23:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:23:42):**  been a huge impact on sovereign bond yields just through the economy over the past six  
**[0:23:49-0:23:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:23:49):**  months, Argentina effectively owes a considerable amount of US dollars both to the IMF, but  
**[0:23:56-0:23:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:23:56):**  also to sovereign bond investors.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:23:59):**  Now when we look at what generates essentially net income for the economy of Argentina, 70%  
**[0:24:07-0:24:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:24:07):**  of Argentina's exports rely on natural capital in their production.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:24:12):**  It's very much-  
**[0:24:13-0:24:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:24:13):**  70, right?  
**[0:24:14-0:24:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:24:14):**  70.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:24:15):**  70.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:24:16):**  So, and if we look across the G20, so Brazil, Argentina, and Indonesia are the top three  
**[0:24:21-0:24:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:24:21):**  countries that rely on natural capital export, based exports to generate economic growth.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:24:27):**  And so with the case of Argentina, it's very much an agricultural-based economy, and two  
**[0:24:33-0:24:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:24:33):**  of the main agricultural products are soybeans and livestock.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:24:39):**  And what we've seen is that actually there's been a huge amount of deforestation of the  
**[0:24:44-0:24:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:24:44):**  Serrado and of forest there is to create landscapes for the production of soy and the production  
**[0:24:50-0:24:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:24:50):**  of livestock.  
**[0:24:51-0:24:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:24:51):**  And the soy is very important for the economy because it gets exported in not only raw form,  
**[0:24:56-0:25:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:24:56):**  but also gets processed into, for example, biodiesel.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:25:00):**  And 60% of Europe's biodiesel is actually originated from Argentina for looking at soy-based  
**[0:25:07-0:25:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:25:07):**  biodiesel.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:25:08):**  And so what we've seen with Argentina is that they've got this big US dollar deficit or  
**[0:25:14-0:25:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:25:14):**  liability sitting on the national balance sheet.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:25:18):**  They've got a low US dollar level of treasury reserves.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:25:23):**  And so therefore, they rely on generating positive US dollar-based balance of payments  
**[0:25:27-0:25:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:25:27):**  to actually service those liabilities.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:25:29):**  Now, if we go to the drought which Argentina had in 2018, we know that those droughts had  
**[0:25:37-0:25:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:25:37):**  a significant impact on the production of soybeans.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:25:41):**  And if you look at actually the costs of that, which has been cited by credit rating agencies,  
**[0:25:45-0:25:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:25:45):**  is that generally they account for about $14 billion worth of lost balance of payments  
**[0:25:51-0:25:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:25:51):**  receipts coming into the economy.  
**[0:25:53-0:26:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:25:53):**  Now, Argentina defaulted on an $8 billion payments to the IMF resulting in or triggering  
**[0:26:00-0:26:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:26:00):**  another release of standby agreement funding.  
**[0:26:03-0:26:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:26:03):**  So if that drought hadn't taken place or if the sector had been more resilient, then actually  
**[0:26:10-0:26:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:26:10):**  you could argue that that standby agreement trigger would not have taken place.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:26:16):**  During a field trip to go to one of the main production sites in Argentina in Rosario,  
**[0:26:21-0:26:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:26:21):**  a number of the local farmers were commenting on two fronts.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:26:25):**  One, the impact of the drought, but two, the impact of soils because they've got decreasing  
**[0:26:31-0:26:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:26:31):**  soil productivity, which actually impacts their short to medium term ability to maintain  
**[0:26:36-0:26:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:26:36):**  the consistent rate of yield, so production yield off their land.  
**[0:26:42-0:26:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:26:42):**  Add into that a prohibitive tax regime and actually the whole sector and the whole economy  
**[0:26:47-0:26:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:26:47):**  is going to suffer and that needs to be priced in to the forward sovereign bond outlook by  
**[0:26:53-0:26:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:26:53):**  analysts.  
**[0:26:55-0:27:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:26:55):**  And we didn't find or we hardly found any analysts who actually looking at this in their  
**[0:27:00-0:27:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:27:00):**  valuations of sovereign bond yields and sovereign bond default risk for the economy.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:27:06):**  And so these are the types of, I think, quite simple linkages that we want to be able to  
**[0:27:10-0:27:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:27:10):**  make and present capital markets.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:27:13):**  So basically the link between Argentina owes a lot of dollars because of history and because  
**[0:27:19-0:27:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:27:19):**  of the last years and needs a lot of dollars and basically gets that mainly through agriculture  
**[0:27:24-0:27:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:27:24):**  outputs and agriculture export.  
**[0:27:26-0:27:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:27:26):**  And at the same time, this agriculture sector is really, really suffering because of climate  
**[0:27:30-0:27:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:27:30):**  change, because of non-regenerative methods.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:27:33):**  So it's sort of a, I wouldn't say a perfect storm, but it's definitely a huge risk if  
**[0:27:38-0:27:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:27:38):**  you are exposed to the sovereign bonds and you're saying that this risk is not priced  
**[0:27:42-0:27:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:27:42):**  into the price of the sovereign bonds.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:27:45):**  And you're seeing these type of risks basically, I mean, that's been the last 15 years probably  
**[0:27:50-0:27:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:27:50):**  of your life Mark to finding these risks not being priced in is like a continuum.  
**[0:27:54-0:27:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:27:54):**  Sure.  
**[0:27:55-0:27:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:27:55):**  Yeah, no, sure.  
**[0:27:57-0:28:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:27:57):**  I mean, if you're an analyst trying to come up with a methodology or a framework to think  
**[0:28:03-0:28:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:28:03):**  about how to incorporate these types of the risks that Matt's been describing so well,  
**[0:28:09-0:28:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:28:09):**  or scarcity risks is quite complex.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:28:13):**  And if there are people who work in the accountancy profession that are listening in, there is  
**[0:28:20-0:28:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:28:20):**  a biological accounting definitions, which are used by companies, which were involved  
**[0:28:27-0:28:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:28:27):**  in say forestry or agriculture.  
**[0:28:30-0:28:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:28:30):**  So accountants know that when something grows, it increases the value of the asset.  
**[0:28:38-0:28:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:28:38):**  And so you have a biological accounting framework for valuing that.  
**[0:28:44-0:28:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:28:44):**  And so in the case of farmed fish, you can actually use these biological accounting techniques  
**[0:28:49-0:28:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:28:49):**  to come up and count how many fish there are and what they're worth.  
**[0:28:53-0:29:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:28:53):**  But when you, when it comes to the open seas, all that accounting understanding is thrown  
**[0:29:00-0:29:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:29:00):**  out the window and no biological accounting actually applies to natural capital because  
**[0:29:06-0:29:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:29:06):**  of the open seas.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:29:07):**  There's no way of defining what is yours and how you find it and how you account for it.  
**[0:29:14-0:29:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:29:14):**  And so data issues, accounting issues are complex.  
**[0:29:18-0:29:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:29:18):**  And the only way to solve this problem is to literally put a label on every single fish  
**[0:29:22-0:29:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:29:22):**  in the sea, and then you can work out who owns it, which of course is impossible in  
**[0:29:26-0:29:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:29:26):**  practice.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:29:27):**  But you can see some of the challenges that we have in really properly addressing from  
**[0:29:33-0:29:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:29:33):**  an accounting point of view, from a financial point of view, how can you put a value on  
**[0:29:36-0:29:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:29:36):**  something which you don't know who owns it, you don't know where it's located, you don't  
**[0:29:41-0:29:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:29:41):**  know how it's going to be used, you don't know how it's going to be replaced.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:29:45):**  These are big complex issues.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:29:46):**  And we're just really at the beginning, I think, of the journey of trying to understand  
**[0:29:51-0:29:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:29:51):**  how any of us who are involved in finance can put our arms around such a huge challenge  
**[0:29:57-0:30:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:29:57):**  because if we don't, you know, more people talk jokingly, well, with some seriousness,  
**[0:30:04-0:30:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:30:04):**  that water will be where the new wars will start from.  
**[0:30:07-0:30:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:30:07):**  And because we haven't properly accounted for it.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:30:10):**  And there's battles between communities versus corporations for scarce assets of which water  
**[0:30:15-0:30:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:30:15):**  is a classic example.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:30:16):**  And does that generate, because you mentioned you've seen in the last year or so, quite  
**[0:30:22-0:30:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:30:22):**  a few analysts, especially in Europe, and quite a few, let's say, financial institutions  
**[0:30:27-0:30:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:30:27):**  that are starting to get this, does this mean that slowly, we're getting to a place where  
**[0:30:33-0:30:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:30:33):**  the opportunities are becoming more interesting, like the one you mentioned in Japan, like  
**[0:30:37-0:30:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:30:37):**  actually, they would manage their fisheries sustainably, the potential is a lot bigger.  
**[0:30:41-0:30:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:30:41):**  Do you see more and more people looking at like this business case for regenerating a  
**[0:30:45-0:30:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:30:45):**  natural capital?  
**[0:30:46-0:30:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:30:46):**  Is that is that something you see already?  
**[0:30:48-0:30:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:30:48):**  Or is that something you would like to see, obviously?  
**[0:30:51-0:30:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:30:51):**  And what is the what do you see there, but to both of you, actually,  
**[0:30:53-0:30:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:30:53):**  We're definitely seeing opportunities around regenerative natural capital in terms of businesses  
**[0:30:59-0:31:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:30:59):**  and looking at the positive impact that that has on investors.  
**[0:31:04-0:31:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:31:04):**  And I think to use another illustration from some of our aquaculture researchers, at the  
**[0:31:10-0:31:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:31:10):**  end of last year, we launched a salmon briefing paper looking at the global salmon industry  
**[0:31:16-0:31:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:31:16):**  and specifically listed companies operating in the industry.  
**[0:31:22-0:31:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:31:22):**  And we took the top 10 listed salmon producers by revenue globally.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:31:29):**  And we looked at we did a backdated analysis over the past five years.  
**[0:31:34-0:31:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:31:34):**  And we said, if you took their forecast production rates at the start of the year versus their  
**[0:31:38-0:31:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:31:38):**  actual production rate at the end of the year, what was what was the difference?  
**[0:31:43-0:31:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:31:43):**  And we found a decrease of actually it was between six to eight percent in achieved versus  
**[0:31:51-0:31:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:31:51):**  forecast production.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:31:52):**  And we then started to look at some of the reasons behind that.  
**[0:31:55-0:32:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:31:55):**  And generally, the vast majority of reasons were were natural in the sense of it was increased  
**[0:32:01-0:32:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:32:01):**  water temperature, increased instances of parasites such as seed lice, increased instances  
**[0:32:09-0:32:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:32:09):**  of algal blooms, which can be caused by, for example, agricultural runoff of fertilizers  
**[0:32:14-0:32:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:32:14):**  and pesticides.  
**[0:32:16-0:32:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:32:16):**  And so what we're seeing is that actually the the the area of suitable environments  
**[0:32:24-0:32:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:32:24):**  for coastal salmon farming globally is shrinking at the same time the number of farms is growing.  
**[0:32:31-0:32:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:32:31):**  And so what we're seeing are huge advancements in the development of different types of technology,  
**[0:32:36-0:32:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:32:36):**  both for for inland aquaculture, which will have a huge bearing if it can be achieved  
**[0:32:42-0:32:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:32:42):**  at a cost competitive rate in terms of providing protein, especially in developed markets,  
**[0:32:47-0:32:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:32:47):**  but also actually deep sea or high sea aquaculture.  
**[0:32:51-0:32:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:32:51):**  Now, what the capital markets need to recognize is that there is a big growth opportunity  
**[0:32:56-0:33:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:32:56):**  there, but the pricing and the financing of of these of these opportunities needs to change  
**[0:33:03-0:33:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:33:03):**  because our current salmon prices offshore aquaculture is completely unviable commercially,  
**[0:33:10-0:33:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:33:10):**  as is inland aquaculture.  
**[0:33:12-0:33:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:33:12):**  So fundamentally, prices will need to increase.  
**[0:33:15-0:33:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:33:15):**  And so this then means that companies have to be able to generate more margin, but it  
**[0:33:20-0:33:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:33:20):**  can't be growth at all costs.  
**[0:33:23-0:33:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:33:23):**  We need to be looking at actually increasing the fundamental price of these commodities  
**[0:33:28-0:33:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:33:28):**  to ensure that companies are motivated and incentivized to operate more sustainably.  
**[0:33:34-0:33:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:33:34):**  And at the moment, history tells us that operating more sustainably can cost more money.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:33:39):**  But actually, in the medium to long term, those costs are recovered very quickly.  
**[0:33:44-0:33:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:33:44):**  And ultimately, you end up with a more robust, more sustainable, more profitable business.  
**[0:33:49-0:33:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:33:49):**  So so I think we are seeing really interesting opportunities available in different sectors.  
**[0:33:53-0:33:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:33:53):**  That's great to hear.  
**[0:33:55-0:33:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:33:55):**  I think a lot of people on the call would either argue that they are working on that,  
**[0:33:59-0:34:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:33:59):**  maybe not yet to the level of a publicly listed company, but hopefully in a few years.  
**[0:34:05-0:34:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:34:05):**  And let's say the investors on the call would probably be interested to see how to put money  
**[0:34:09-0:34:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:34:09):**  to work there.  
**[0:34:10-0:34:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:34:10):**  So I want to be conscious of your time and ask a few final questions.  
**[0:34:13-0:34:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:34:13):**  And one is actually to both of you.  
**[0:34:16-0:34:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:34:16):**  If you could wave a magic wand and tomorrow morning we wake up and either you, Mark, or  
**[0:34:20-0:34:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:34:20):**  you Matt have changed something in if you've changed one thing in the agriculture industry  
**[0:34:25-0:34:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:34:25):**  from a sustainability point of view, what would that be?  
**[0:34:28-0:34:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:34:28):**  Let's say the land use industry, let's take it a bit broader and just act.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:34:32):**  What would you both change overnight if you had the power?  
**[0:34:35-0:34:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:34:35):**  Oh, that's such an easy question.  
**[0:34:37-0:34:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:34:37):**  Come on, Matt, you can do that one first.  
**[0:34:39-0:34:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:34:39):**  My number one issue is I believe soil.  
**[0:34:43-0:34:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:34:43):**  And how do we build agricultural and livestock systems that manage to maintain the integrity  
**[0:34:49-0:34:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:34:49):**  of soil?  
**[0:34:52-0:34:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:34:52):**  Because soil provides the platform for all agricultural growth.  
**[0:34:58-0:35:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:34:58):**  And there's some excellent groups such as Soil Capital based in London who are doing  
**[0:35:02-0:35:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:35:02):**  amazing work around looking at different forms of regenerative agriculture and looking at  
**[0:35:08-0:35:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:35:08):**  soil health.  
**[0:35:09-0:35:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:35:09):**  And soil health is fundamental to feeding the planet.  
**[0:35:12-0:35:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:35:12):**  So in the agriculture space, that one's quite straightforward for me.  
**[0:35:16-0:35:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:35:16):**  And what about you, Mark?  
**[0:35:18-0:35:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:35:18):**  Yeah, I'm going to take a different angle.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:35:22):**  I do think it's possible that not that market mechanisms panacea and solve all the problems,  
**[0:35:29-0:35:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:35:29):**  they don't.  
**[0:35:30-0:35:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:35:30):**  But I do think that we could build the case.  
**[0:35:32-0:35:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:35:32):**  But similar to the task force on climate related financial disclosures that were set up, that  
**[0:35:37-0:35:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:35:37):**  financial regulators, I'm thinking particularly stock exchange regulators and regulators governing  
**[0:35:43-0:35:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/#t=0:35:43):**  the issuance of bonds and equities, can encourage any company involved in managing natural capital

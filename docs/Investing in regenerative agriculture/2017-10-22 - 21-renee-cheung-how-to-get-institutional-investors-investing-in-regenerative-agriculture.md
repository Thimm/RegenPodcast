**[0:00:27-0:00:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:00:27):**  in this revolution.

**[0:00:31-0:00:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:00:31):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture.  
**[0:00:35-0:00:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:00:35):**  Investing as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:00:36):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:41-0:00:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:00:41):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:00:46-0:00:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:00:46):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:00:50):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:53-0:00:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:00:53):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:00:57-0:00:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:00:57):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:00:59):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much  
**[0:01:04-0:01:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:01:04):**  more attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:09-0:01:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:01:09):**  Before we get started, I have been recording these interviews next to my day job and I  
**[0:01:13-0:01:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:01:13):**  will definitely continue to do so and release about an episode a month.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:01:16):**  But at the same time I would love to take this further.  
**[0:01:19-0:01:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:01:19):**  Share more interviews, there are many more stories to share on investing in regenerative  
**[0:01:23-0:01:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:01:23):**  food and agriculture.  
**[0:01:25-0:01:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:01:25):**  More depth, improve the quality, maybe even doing some video series.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:01:29):**  So I started a Patreon community which makes it easy to support creators like myself.

**[0:01:50-0:01:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:01:50):**  Enjoy!  
**[0:01:51-0:01:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:01:51):**  Welcome to Investing in Regenerative Agriculture, investing as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:01:55-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:01:55):**  I'm Koen Van Zeyen, your host, and in the podcast of today I'm joined by Renée Chang,  
**[0:02:00-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:02:00):**  founder of Pontera Partners, a natural capital investment specialist.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:02:04):**  She works with investors to identify and invest in sustainable, profit generating, environmental  
**[0:02:09-0:02:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:02:09):**  and real asset strategies.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:02:11):**  To do the investment research, strategy analysis, but also the deal negotiations.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:02:15):**  We're gonna have a lot to talk about I think.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:02:17):**  Welcome Renée!  
**[0:02:18-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:02:18):**  Thank you Koen!  
**[0:02:19-0:02:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:02:19):**  So to start with, as I like to do, a personal question.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:02:22):**  How did you end up in regenerative agriculture and the investment side of things?  
**[0:02:26-0:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:02:26):**  Kind of in a roundabout way but also in a very very fortunate way.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:02:31):**  So my background is in private equity.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:02:34):**  I've been doing that in both San Francisco and London for quite a few years.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:02:38):**  But then deep inside my heart, my passion has always been conservation, environmental  
**[0:02:43-0:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:02:43):**  conservation.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:02:44):**  So about 2010 I basically decided that I will leave private equity, leave London and try  
**[0:02:51-0:02:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:02:51):**  to move to South America to start doing some environmental volunteering work.  
**[0:02:57-0:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:02:57):**  That was my goal.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:02:58):**  But when I moved down to Buenos Aires in Argentina, I ended up being introduced to a sustainable  
**[0:03:05-0:03:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:03:05):**  agriculture company that has a very long term vision of what environmental sustainability  
**[0:03:10-0:03:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:03:10):**  should look like.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:03:11):**  They care a ton about conservation and wildlife and biodiversity and they happened to need  
**[0:03:16-0:03:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:03:16):**  help looking at new investment opportunities.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:03:21):**  So they basically asked me to help them and they became my first client.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:03:27):**  I helped them analyze and evaluate investment opportunities that they wanted to look at.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:03:33):**  So in a way it has worked out really well because it allows me to combine my skill set  
**[0:03:38-0:03:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:03:38):**  in private equity investing with my passion for the environment.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:03:43):**  And through this first client I started to learn more and more about agriculture and  
**[0:03:47-0:03:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:03:47):**  then soon after that I learned about regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:03:50):**  And so it kind of all kind of snowballs from there.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:03:52):**  Wow that's a great coincidence that you met them there.  
**[0:03:56-0:04:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:03:56):**  And how did the transition from, not even a transition but going from I'm focused on  
**[0:04:01-0:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:04:01):**  conservation to looking at agriculture, was it a gradual place or did it happen, was there  
**[0:04:10-0:04:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:04:10):**  a specific moment where you saw how important agriculture could be for conservation?  
**[0:04:17-0:04:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:04:17):**  Yeah, well when I was in finance, when I was in private equity, I was a generalist.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:04:22):**  I was looking at all sectors, in many ways not conservation focused.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:04:28):**  But for sure not.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:04:29):**  But during that time I started looking at red carbon credits, reduction emissions for  
**[0:04:37-0:04:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:04:37):**  deforestation, degradation.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:04:40):**  And I started looking at that and thinking that well potentially maybe that's something  
**[0:04:43-0:04:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:04:43):**  that I can shift my career towards, to look at forestry carbon.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:04:47):**  But then the Copenhagen conference in 2009, it didn't really turn out well.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:04:53):**  The US didn't agree to that.  
**[0:04:56-0:05:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:04:56):**  And so I realized okay maybe there's actually not a very sure future for forestry carbon  
**[0:05:01-0:05:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:05:01):**  at least at that time.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:05:03):**  And then it was also by coincidence that I met the sustainable agriculture company.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:05:07):**  So I basically just shifted my focus towards agriculture.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:05:10):**  And that's when I realized actually the whole world needs to eat food regardless.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:05:14):**  There's a lot to do.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:05:16):**  There are a lot of issues, environmental issues surrounding modern agriculture.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:05:20):**  So I thought maybe this is what I should actually focus more of my time on.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:05:25):**  And the next few clients after that, they all became agriculture related opportunities.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:05:30):**  And so I just kind of gained my knowledge and gained my knowledge and gained my interest  
**[0:05:34-0:05:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:05:34):**  that way.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:05:35):**  And so now even though Bonterra Partners looks at different types of natural capital investments,  
**[0:05:40-0:05:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:05:40):**  I would say agriculture is pretty much the most important bit of what I do in addition  
**[0:05:46-0:05:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:05:46):**  to say fisheries and forestry, etc.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:05:49):**  And if you look at agriculture and what you've seen in the past years in terms of regenerative  
**[0:05:54-0:06:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:05:54):**  agriculture, what has been the most inspirational example you have seen both maybe from an investor  
**[0:06:02-0:06:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:06:02):**  point of view or from the agriculture company point of view?  
**[0:06:06-0:06:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:06:06):**  What was the one that really, really stood out?  
**[0:06:11-0:06:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:06:11):**  I think I have seen the evolution and pickup of holistic management grazing of how just  
**[0:06:17-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:06:17):**  even I would say six, seven years ago, very, very few have heard of it or those have heard  
**[0:06:23-0:06:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:06:23):**  of it, they don't believe in it.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:06:25):**  Yeah, it's very hard to believe it seems for livestock farmers that there is another way  
**[0:06:29-0:06:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:06:29):**  possible.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:06:30):**  Exactly.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:06:31):**  And now in 2000, you know, starting 2000, I would say maybe 15 and after you start hearing  
**[0:06:37-0:06:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:06:37):**  big NGOs talking about, yes, we can actually work with ranchers, we don't need to get rid  
**[0:06:41-0:06:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:06:41):**  of all the cattle and sheep, you know, we actually want to support them and work with  
**[0:06:44-0:06:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:06:44):**  them to figure out how to graze them in a sustainable regenerative way by using intensive  
**[0:06:49-0:06:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:06:49):**  rotational grazing, or holistic plant grazing, whatever you want to call it.  
**[0:06:53-0:06:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:06:53):**  So I think I have definitely seen the big change in that, which is very encouraging  
**[0:06:57-0:07:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:06:57):**  to me.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:07:00):**  And then I think another thing that American farmers are looking more and more at is now  
**[0:07:06-0:07:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:07:06):**  they're considering, okay, cover crops, that's actually quite important.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:07:10):**  So I see that they are embracing that more and more and also no till slowly.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:07:16):**  I think no till is still generally like a pretty new concept in the US.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:07:20):**  But the truth is in Brazil and Argentina, for example, they've been doing it for a  
**[0:07:24-0:07:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:07:24):**  long, long time.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:07:25):**  So it's, so it's good for me to see that American farmers are kind of shifting towards that  
**[0:07:31-0:07:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:07:31):**  way as well.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:07:32):**  And from an investor perspective, what are the big changes you've seen there?  
**[0:07:37-0:07:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:07:37):**  From the investor side, especially from say, high net worth individuals, family offices,  
**[0:07:42-0:07:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:07:42):**  you know, the more progressive type of investors.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:07:46):**  What I've seen is, say, from five or six years ago, they would, very few of them would have  
**[0:07:53-0:07:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:07:53):**  even considered investing in sustainable agriculture.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:07:58):**  Now by now, I feel like they, they have heard of regenerative agriculture, they have now  
**[0:08:03-0:08:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:08:03):**  heard of holistic management, they have now heard of, say, other things such as key line  
**[0:08:10-0:08:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:08:10):**  farming, and incorporating multiple crops together on the same farm, mixed cropping  
**[0:08:15-0:08:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:08:15):**  and all that.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:08:16):**  They are definitely warming up to the idea.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:08:18):**  And now, some of them are saying, actually, we want to start investing in the sector because  
**[0:08:23-0:08:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:08:23):**  we understand how important it is.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:08:25):**  So I think that's good.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:08:26):**  But that's actually at the, at the more progressive type, that only applies to the more progressive,  
**[0:08:32-0:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:08:32):**  smaller investors, I would say.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:08:34):**  So that would be institutional investors, you know, the large pension funds, university  
**[0:08:39-0:08:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:08:39):**  endowments, etc.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:08:42):**  They are still moving very slowly.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:08:44):**  I don't think many of them are really looking at sustainable agriculture, let alone regenerative  
**[0:08:49-0:08:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:08:49):**  agriculture investments at this point.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:08:52):**  And for, let's unpack both of them, actually.  
**[0:08:55-0:09:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:08:55):**  For these institutions, what are the biggest barriers for them to get into this space?  
**[0:09:01-0:09:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:09:01):**  For the large institutional investors, you mean?  
**[0:09:04-0:09:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:09:04):**  Yeah, for the large ones.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:09:05):**  Yeah.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:09:06):**  Yeah.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:09:07):**  The way they work is, you know, you try to pitch an idea to somebody on the investment  
**[0:09:11-0:09:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:09:11):**  team, but who makes the ultimate say is, of course, the investment committee.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:09:16):**  And in other cases, it could be the ultimate, the shareholders of the organization.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:09:20):**  And so for these people to convince the investment committees and the shareholders to invest  
**[0:09:25-0:09:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:09:25):**  in something, it needs to be something that's quite straightforward and simple and can be  
**[0:09:30-0:09:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:09:30):**  easily explained.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:09:31):**  A bit boring, basically.  
**[0:09:32-0:09:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:09:32):**  It has to be boring.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:09:34):**  It has to be boring or else the investment committee will not understand what it is.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:09:39):**  Hence, you know, with a lot of the large agricultural opportunities such as monoculture, GMO, corn  
**[0:09:46-0:09:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:09:46):**  soil rotation, or just investing in cattle that's being fed in a feedlot, all of those,  
**[0:09:53-0:09:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:09:53):**  they're actually quite easy to understand for the investment committee.  
**[0:09:56-0:10:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:09:56):**  So it's much easier for those investments to be approved than for you to try to present  
**[0:10:03-0:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:10:03):**  a regenerative agriculture opportunity to them and hoping that they will invest in it  
**[0:10:07-0:10:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:10:07):**  because regenerative agriculture and mother nature by itself is more complex.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:10:13):**  Regenerative agriculture investments or just practicing or implementing regenerative agriculture  
**[0:10:18-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:10:18):**  operations, in general, they require a lot more thinking.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:10:22):**  They require more planning.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:10:24):**  And sometimes, depending on what it is, it could require a bit more labor.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:10:27):**  So all in all, you kind of add all these things up.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:10:30):**  It just becomes something that's not as easy to understand.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:10:33):**  And it will be much harder, I would think, at this point for someone from a pension fund  
**[0:10:39-0:10:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:10:39):**  to explain to the investment committee members why they should invest in a, say, mixed cropping,  
**[0:10:45-0:10:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:10:45):**  farming business where you combine different permanent crops with some maybe annual grasses,  
**[0:10:50-0:10:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:10:50):**  annual crops, and how that's all going to mix together with, say, different livestock.  
**[0:10:55-0:11:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:10:55):**  So I think to them, it's just not simple enough, which is unfortunate because from my point  
**[0:11:00-0:11:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:11:00):**  of view, regenerative agriculture, the beauty of that is it actually mimics nature, which,  
**[0:11:05-0:11:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:11:05):**  like I said previously, is not that straightforward.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:11:08):**  It's a bit more complex and it requires more adaptation and thinking and planning.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:11:13):**  And the role of these institutions, especially pension funds and insurance companies, could  
**[0:11:18-0:11:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:11:18):**  be transformational in the sector because not only because of the amount of capital  
**[0:11:24-0:11:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:11:24):**  they hold, but also because of the supposedly long-term view they should have because they're  
**[0:11:30-0:11:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:11:30):**  going to be there for a while.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:11:32):**  But yeah, the systems and the processes internally have to probably catch up with what's happening  
**[0:11:40-0:11:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:11:40):**  in the impact space in general, but especially in agriculture.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:11:44):**  And I think at the end of the day, for them, the ultimate goal and their primary fiduciary  
**[0:11:49-0:11:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:11:49):**  duty to their shareholders is actually financial return.  
**[0:11:54-0:11:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:11:54):**  And so I think the...  
**[0:11:58-0:12:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:11:58):**  It would be nice to have a living planet.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:12:00):**  Right, exactly.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:12:01):**  I absolutely agree.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:12:02):**  The shareholders should think about, do I want there to be a planet for my grandchildren  
**[0:12:07-0:12:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:12:07):**  to live in?  
**[0:12:08-0:12:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:12:08):**  But maybe they don't think that far yet.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:12:11):**  So yeah, so basically I think for regenerative agriculture investments, they basically see  
**[0:12:17-0:12:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:12:17):**  that as something that's very new.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:12:19):**  It hasn't been fully proven.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:12:20):**  And yet the financial return may just be similar to what they see from a conventional agriculture  
**[0:12:29-0:12:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:12:29):**  investment.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:12:30):**  So I think from their standpoint, they're like, the risk reward profile is not quite  
**[0:12:35-0:12:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:12:35):**  there yet.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:12:36):**  It's easier to go for the ones you've already done and done before.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:12:42):**  Or ones you have already seen, even though some of them may have failed in the past.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:12:46):**  But at least they understand the risk.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:12:48):**  Okay, if I plant GMO corn and soy, then my biggest risk would be say input cost and the  
**[0:12:53-0:12:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:12:53):**  climate.  
**[0:12:54-0:12:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:12:54):**  But then they don't question, will there be skills?  
**[0:12:58-0:13:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:12:58):**  Will I have an issue hiring somebody to run a tractor down that farm?  
**[0:13:03-0:13:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:13:03):**  Those are not issues that they need to worry about.  
**[0:13:06-0:13:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:13:06):**  But for regenerative agriculture, I think the skills and the experience in the sector  
**[0:13:12-0:13:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:13:12):**  overall, that's just slowly building up.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:13:15):**  So I think that's another challenge for regenerative agriculture investment currently is, it's  
**[0:13:22-0:13:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:13:22):**  hard for you to find, it's not that easy to find skilled operators out there who have  
**[0:13:27-0:13:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:13:27):**  done it for many years and who can run the farm in a regenerative way for you.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:13:33):**  They are around, but there are just not many.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:13:34):**  Yeah, I think it's actually one of the main challenges we have.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:13:39):**  We don't have too many people that can really work the land well in a regenerative way at  
**[0:13:46-0:13:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:13:46):**  scale considering all the economic costs and everything involved.  
**[0:13:51-0:13:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:13:51):**  It's a very, very small group and they have many options to choose from.  
**[0:13:56-0:14:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:13:56):**  So it's not that easy to get them to the one you want them to go to.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:14:00):**  Exactly.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:14:01):**  I mean, a lot of them, they actually have their own farms and they're making quite a  
**[0:14:04-0:14:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:14:04):**  good profit.  
**[0:14:05-0:14:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:14:05):**  So it's not their intention to go and raise a fund and work with investors.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:14:12):**  They're happy on their own farm.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:14:14):**  Yeah, why would they?  
**[0:14:16-0:14:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:14:16):**  To go through all that trouble if their farm is doing well and their lifestyle, of course,  
**[0:14:21-0:14:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:14:21):**  they work incredibly hard.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:14:24):**  They can do what they love the most, which is working on the land.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:14:26):**  Exactly.  
**[0:14:27-0:14:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:14:27):**  As opposed to having to pitch to investors who then ask you, what is this about?  
**[0:14:32-0:14:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:14:32):**  What is the difference between a steer and a heifer and a cow?  
**[0:14:36-0:14:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:14:36):**  Things like that.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:14:37):**  So, yeah.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:14:38):**  Yeah, we can't blame them actually to not do that.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:14:42):**  But we do need them to do it.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:14:45):**  And then do you see, because I saw some announcements and read some reports on some larger funds  
**[0:14:52-0:14:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:14:52):**  being announced, and especially one you have been interacting with and also worked on a  
**[0:14:58-0:15:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:14:58):**  report with them, which is the Land Neutral Degradation Fund, and I'm probably mixing  
**[0:15:02-0:15:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:15:02):**  up the name now.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:15:03):**  Can you explain a bit what they are about?  
**[0:15:06-0:15:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:15:06):**  Because they are just launched, I think, two or three weeks ago, but they've been in the  
**[0:15:11-0:15:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:15:11):**  making for a while.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:15:12):**  Is this something that these institutional investors could grab and could get behind?  
**[0:15:17-0:15:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:15:17):**  Yeah.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:15:18):**  So the Land Degradation Neutrality Fund, the LDN fund, is, I would say, as a partnership  
**[0:15:25-0:15:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:15:25):**  between Mirova, which is an impact investment firm that's based in Paris, together with  
**[0:15:31-0:15:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:15:31):**  the UNCCD, which is the United Nations Convention to Combat De-certification.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:15:37):**  So the idea of the LDN fund is an impact investment fund that is going to use a blended finance  
**[0:15:46-0:15:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:15:46):**  structure that will bring in both public and private money to invest in projects around  
**[0:15:53-0:15:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:15:53):**  the world that will restore or regenerate degraded land.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:15:59):**  And so a lot of the projects that they're considering, for example, would be in the  
**[0:16:03-0:16:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:16:03):**  agriculture and forestry space, not just in developing countries, but also in developed  
**[0:16:09-0:16:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:16:09):**  countries.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:16:11):**  And the idea for them is to, for example, first bring in the public financing, whether  
**[0:16:16-0:16:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:16:16):**  it's from a DFI or government, the public financing will take the most risky tranche  
**[0:16:23-0:16:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:16:23):**  of the structure.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:16:25):**  And then hopefully then with that, they can bring in some private impact investment money  
**[0:16:29-0:16:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:16:29):**  to take the less risky bit of the capital and use that to provide financing for projects  
**[0:16:36-0:16:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:16:36):**  around the world that shows the potential to restore degraded land.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:16:41):**  Which is a huge step for the sector.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:16:43):**  I think there hasn't been any blended capital or layered capital funds of this size, at  
**[0:16:51-0:17:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:16:51):**  least that I have seen that are so focused on soil land degradation and agriculture.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:17:00):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:17:01):**  And basically with the UN, one of their sustainable development goals is to restore, is to keep  
**[0:17:07-0:17:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:17:07):**  land at a neutral state, so restore degraded land.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:17:11):**  And they realise that relying on just public funding and philanthropy, that's not going  
**[0:17:15-0:17:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:17:15):**  to be sufficient.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:17:16):**  And so that's why they believe that they should try to come up with a blended finance vehicle  
**[0:17:22-0:17:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:17:22):**  that will try to, that can try to bring in private capital without letting the private  
**[0:17:30-0:17:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:17:30):**  investors take on all the risks so that their DFI is willing to come in and take the more  
**[0:17:34-0:17:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:17:34):**  risky tranche, like I said, and use that to start to build up a vehicle.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:17:40):**  And this is, the LDN Fund's ambition is not for this to be the only fund.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:17:45):**  They hope that this will just be fund one and then there will be other funds in the  
**[0:17:48-0:17:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:17:48):**  future.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:17:49):**  Because like you said, the amount of capital that's required to restore the amount of degraded  
**[0:17:54-0:17:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:17:54):**  land around the world and provide people with, sustain the livelihoods and provide food for  
**[0:17:59-0:18:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:17:59):**  people, a lot of capital needs to go into that space.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:18:03):**  Many times this fund.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:18:04):**  Yes.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:18:05):**  And is this, these type of structures from your experience with institutional investors  
**[0:18:09-0:18:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:18:09):**  that maybe are looking at this space and are thinking and knowing that they have to become  
**[0:18:14-0:18:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:18:14):**  active and they want to become active, but of course they have, like we discussed, the  
**[0:18:18-0:18:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:18:18):**  structures and the processes inside to make it difficult.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:18:21):**  Are these type of structures, maybe not specifically this fund, and of course it's difficult to  
**[0:18:27-0:18:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:18:27):**  look into the heads of pension fund investors, but are these type of structures, the structures  
**[0:18:31-0:18:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:18:31):**  and the language that they speak more easily?  
**[0:18:34-0:18:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:18:34):**  So maybe this could mean more of the institutional money becomes available.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:18:40):**  I think the institutional money could be interested later on, say by say a fund three or fund  
**[0:18:45-0:18:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:18:45):**  four, after they have seen how the first one or two funds have performed.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:18:51):**  Because I think as I mentioned earlier, for most of these pension funds, the financial  
**[0:18:55-0:18:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:18:55):**  return is still of primary concern to them.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:18:59):**  So I think if it's just a fund one or two, they may say, well, we don't quite know the  
**[0:19:04-0:19:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:19:04):**  track record of this yet.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:19:05):**  We don't even know if this concept of putting money through a blended structure into LDN  
**[0:19:11-0:19:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:19:11):**  type of projects is going to work.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:19:12):**  So let's wait and see.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:19:15):**  And also the LDN fund, for example, and usually a lot of these blended finance structures  
**[0:19:23-0:19:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:19:23):**  usually are not aiming to deliver very high market rate return to investors.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:19:28):**  So unless I would say, unless an institutional investor actually has impact in mind or actually  
**[0:19:34-0:19:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:19:34):**  has an impact investment program in mind where they are willing or they are ready to accept  
**[0:19:41-0:19:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:19:41):**  slightly lower market rate returns because they want to support certain causes, I still  
**[0:19:47-0:19:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:19:47):**  think maybe this type of funds or vehicles probably won't be the type of investments  
**[0:19:55-0:19:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:19:55):**  that some of these large institutional investors will invest in until later on, or unless someone  
**[0:19:59-0:20:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:19:59):**  can come up with a fund structure that actually will allow these investors to receive a stellar  
**[0:20:06-0:20:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:20:06):**  market rate return, then they'll be like, oh, it's no brainer.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:20:08):**  I can get my high return and at the same time be supporting impact.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:20:12):**  Which is of course the holy grail.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:20:14):**  But for you, the first, let's say the first few funds or these structures will be mainly  
**[0:20:20-0:20:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:20:20):**  invested probably by the progressive high net worth individuals, the larger family offices  
**[0:20:25-0:20:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:20:25):**  that are maybe already comfortable with at least understanding the return of agriculture.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:20:31):**  If you look at this group and you've worked with them, what are for them the main challenges  
**[0:20:38-0:20:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:20:38):**  if you are a high net worth individual and wanting to get into this space and wanting  
**[0:20:44-0:20:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:20:44):**  to put your money to work?  
**[0:20:47-0:20:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:20:47):**  What would be the main challenges for them?  
**[0:20:49-0:20:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:20:49):**  Yeah.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:20:50):**  Well, I think in addition to high net worths and family offices, I think foundations, for  
**[0:20:54-0:20:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:20:54):**  example, could be another possibility.  
**[0:20:57-0:21:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:20:57):**  So thinking of those three groups, the challenge I find often working with different family  
**[0:21:04-0:21:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:21:04):**  offices, high net worth individuals, foundations, et cetera, is they're sometimes almost too  
**[0:21:10-0:21:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:21:10):**  specific in terms of the type of causes they want to support.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:21:15):**  The example I like to give, for example, would be, no, not only do I want to support forestry,  
**[0:21:20-0:21:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:21:20):**  I want to support local redwood trees in my state.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:21:25):**  That becomes very specific.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:21:28):**  An example could be fisheries.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:21:30):**  Not only do I want to support fisheries, I want to support salmon and trout only because  
**[0:21:37-0:21:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:21:37):**  I'm just not as interested in other species.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:21:41):**  So I think with some of the investors, even though they're progressive, but if they have  
**[0:21:45-0:21:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:21:45):**  very specific causes they want to support, which is not a bad thing, then I think a fund  
**[0:21:50-0:21:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:21:50):**  such as the Eldian Fund that is going to invest worldwide because they do want to be diversified,  
**[0:21:56-0:22:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:21:56):**  they want to go into different sectors, different countries, then I think some of these investors  
**[0:22:02-0:22:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:22:02):**  may say, well, sorry, it sounds great, but it's not going to be my cup of tea.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:22:06):**  So I think that's one.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:22:08):**  The other thing would be a similar, a very common due diligence question that all investors  
**[0:22:13-0:22:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:22:13):**  would ask, which would be, can the Eldian Fund team, do they have the capability to  
**[0:22:19-0:22:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:22:19):**  execute?  
**[0:22:20-0:22:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:22:20):**  Given that this is a first fund, they're trying to invest worldwide in all sorts of sectors,  
**[0:22:27-0:22:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:22:27):**  do they have the knowledge and expertise to find the good deals, to negotiate good deals?  
**[0:22:33-0:22:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:22:33):**  How are they going to evaluate and monitor the impact?  
**[0:22:37-0:22:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:22:37):**  All of those questions.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:22:38):**  But that's pretty typical, whether you're investing in impact or not.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:22:42):**  You're basically asking about the management team's capability.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:22:47):**  And when you work with these, let's say family offices, high net worth individuals and foundations,  
**[0:22:54-0:23:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:22:54):**  as you've been doing for many years, what were some case studies of successful ones  
**[0:23:00-0:23:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:23:00):**  and maybe if we can also non-successful ones of deals you looked at, some farms you looked  
**[0:23:06-0:23:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:23:06):**  at, really things that stood out and that showed maybe the progress as well that we  
**[0:23:11-0:23:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:23:11):**  hopefully have made as a regenerative agriculture sector and where we stand now?  
**[0:23:16-0:23:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:23:16):**  Yeah, looking at actually, I did some work for actually an impact investment fund.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:23:24):**  So not a foundation or a high net worth, but then this impact investment fund that they  
**[0:23:30-0:23:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:23:30):**  have been very good at going out there to find good deals to invest in that are, they  
**[0:23:38-0:23:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:23:38):**  invest in companies in Latin America and basically they go for triple bottom line impact and  
**[0:23:45-0:23:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:23:45):**  they have just been very good and disciplined in terms of doing that.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:23:50):**  And so for me, being able to see that they were able to raise, to have not just a fund  
**[0:23:56-0:24:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:23:56):**  one but also a fund two and now currently raising fund three, to me that's very encouraging.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:24:03):**  And you look at some of the portfolio companies, what they have done, they are exactly the  
**[0:24:08-0:24:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:24:08):**  type of regenerative agriculture type of opportunities that we're talking about and where they're  
**[0:24:13-0:24:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:24:13):**  working with small holder farmers and they are creating social impact and they're delivering  
**[0:24:19-0:24:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:24:19):**  healthy food for consumers, et cetera.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:24:22):**  And so for me that's success, but that actually requires my client, that impact investment  
**[0:24:30-0:24:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:24:30):**  fund to have a local team based in Latin America and being out there constantly networking  
**[0:24:37-0:24:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:24:37):**  and sourcing deals and monitoring the investments.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:24:40):**  So that's one that I can think of that has gone very well.  
**[0:24:45-0:24:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:24:45):**  Can you name the fund?  
**[0:24:47-0:24:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:24:47):**  Yeah, I like them a lot so I can actually name them.  
**[0:24:49-0:24:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:24:49):**  It's Eco Enterprises Fund.  
**[0:24:51-0:24:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:24:51):**  I figured.  
**[0:24:52-0:24:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:24:52):**  Yeah.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:24:53):**  Yeah.  
**[0:24:54-0:24:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:24:54):**  So that's one example.  
**[0:24:56-0:25:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:24:56):**  And then I've done some work looking at Chile, for example, and you have interviewed Paul  
**[0:25:03-0:25:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:25:03):**  McMahon at SLM and so together we looked at what can we do again in South America that  
**[0:25:09-0:25:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:25:09):**  will allow us to restore degraded land and at the same time do something that's profitable  
**[0:25:15-0:25:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:25:15):**  and scalable.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:25:16):**  And so we were able to find an operator to help us lead that effort in Chile, which is  
**[0:25:23-0:25:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:25:23):**  great because like I mentioned earlier, it's really hard to find good operators.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:25:26):**  And now currently SLM is fundraising for that.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:25:29):**  So I'm definitely hoping that fundraising will go well and that we can start doing something  
**[0:25:34-0:25:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:25:34):**  in Chile.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:25:35):**  Basically, there will be buying land in Chile and Patagonia and using holistic management  
**[0:25:42-0:25:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:25:42):**  grazing to produce, to do sheep production, producing both sustainable wool and sustainable  
**[0:25:48-0:25:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:25:48):**  lamb and lamb meat.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:25:50):**  So there is that.  
**[0:25:51-0:25:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:25:51):**  And then I can think of one case where I wouldn't call it a failure because my client did not  
**[0:25:56-0:26:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:25:56):**  make the investment in the end, but basically through the due diligence process, we've realized  
**[0:26:01-0:26:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:26:01):**  that even though this investment could be something very good for the environment, the  
**[0:26:08-0:26:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:26:08):**  financial return just wouldn't meet that criteria, wouldn't meet the target that my client had.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:26:12):**  And in this case, it's actually looking at reforestation of native hardwood species in  
**[0:26:19-0:26:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:26:19):**  Latin America.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:26:22):**  So it would basically require buying land and planting high value native hardwood species,  
**[0:26:30-0:26:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:26:30):**  such as say mahogany or Spanish coca-cola wood.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:26:33):**  It's great for the environment and for my client, who I cannot name in this case, unfortunately,  
**[0:26:38-0:26:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:26:38):**  but they have a very, very long-term view.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:26:40):**  So they're in actually in a way in no real hurry for any exit.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:26:45):**  But basically after we did due diligence by going into different countries to talk to  
**[0:26:51-0:26:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:26:51):**  people who have been doing it for a while, we've realized that it's very good for the  
**[0:26:55-0:26:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:26:55):**  environment.  
**[0:26:56-0:26:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:26:56):**  It's great for biodiversity.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:26:58):**  However, the financial return is really not guaranteed because growing a mahogany tree  
**[0:27:03-0:27:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:27:03):**  really takes 40, 50 years.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:27:06):**  And it's really hard to know whether it's actually going to grow well and have that  
**[0:27:10-0:27:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:27:10):**  type of production and yield that you're expecting.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:27:13):**  And so I think even for my client in this case, who is definitely a patient, very patient  
**[0:27:18-0:27:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:27:18):**  investor, waiting 45 years, 40, 50 years and not knowing what the result would be, it just  
**[0:27:25-0:27:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:27:25):**  doesn't make sense from a financial perspective.  
**[0:27:27-0:27:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:27:27):**  So in the end, we decided to not go ahead with this project.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:27:31):**  So I think it's one of those where it is great.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:27:33):**  It can have great environmental and even social impact by creating jobs.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:27:37):**  But unfortunately, financially, I just don't think it's prudent to do so.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:27:41):**  Yeah, no, of course.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:27:42):**  And in terms of, let's say for the next year or so, what do you see or what do you hope  
**[0:27:49-0:27:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:27:49):**  for?  
**[0:27:50-0:27:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:27:50):**  What do you see happening in this space?  
**[0:27:52-0:27:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:27:52):**  If we would talk in September 2018, what do you think we will be discussing in terms of  
**[0:27:59-0:28:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:27:59):**  regenerative agriculture and impact investing?  
**[0:28:01-0:28:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:28:01):**  Good question.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:28:04):**  I think on one hand, regenerative agriculture, like I mentioned earlier, has gotten bigger  
**[0:28:10-0:28:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:28:10):**  in the last five years and more people know about it, which is great.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:28:13):**  But overall, it's not your typical high tech deal where things move so quickly.  
**[0:28:19-0:28:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:28:19):**  So I think my view is probably in a year's time, if you and I were to sit down and have  
**[0:28:25-0:28:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:28:25):**  a chat again, we'll still be wondering how to bring in more capital into the regenerative  
**[0:28:33-0:28:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:28:33):**  agriculture investment space.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:28:34):**  I actually don't think too much is going to change between now and the next 12 months.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:28:41):**  I would be glad to be proven wrong.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:28:42):**  I'll be very happy if that's actually not the case.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:28:45):**  But looking at how some of the regenerative agriculture investments out there have been  
**[0:28:50-0:28:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:28:50):**  trying to fundraise and that they have been finding it challenging, I actually don't see  
**[0:28:57-0:29:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:28:57):**  why things would be too different 12 months from now unless something happens to the economy  
**[0:29:03-0:29:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:29:03):**  or unless all of a sudden people realise that really the way that they have been doing modern  
**[0:29:08-0:29:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:29:08):**  day agriculture, saying the corn belt with your typical corn, soy, all of that all of  
**[0:29:13-0:29:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:29:13):**  a sudden has just gone down the drain in terms of financial terms.  
**[0:29:17-0:29:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:29:17):**  I think that's when it will cause people to rethink, okay, now I really need to do something  
**[0:29:20-0:29:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:29:20):**  differently.  
**[0:29:22-0:29:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:29:22):**  That just did not work.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:29:23):**  So what should I consider?  
**[0:29:24-0:29:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:29:24):**  How about if I think about doing things in a more regenerative way so that I can minimise  
**[0:29:28-0:29:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:29:28):**  my costs and hopefully increase my profit?  
**[0:29:30-0:29:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:29:30):**  I think something will have to happen on the financial side, on the profit bottom line  
**[0:29:38-0:29:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:29:38):**  that will cause people to rethink.  
**[0:29:40-0:29:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:29:40):**  And I think with regards to impact investors, I think what I would like to see slowly, maybe  
**[0:29:47-0:29:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:29:47):**  not within the next 12 months, but at least over the next few years is for impact investors  
**[0:29:53-0:29:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:29:53):**  to figure out what do they really want.  
**[0:29:57-0:30:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:29:57):**  I think if you ask impact investors, a lot of them will tell you they want both the financial  
**[0:30:03-0:30:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:30:03):**  return and the impact.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:30:05):**  But if you really question further and ask deeper, what they really want is actually  
**[0:30:09-0:30:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:30:09):**  the financial return and that hopefully the impact will be there.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:30:15):**  But I would just say and encourage them to just choose one.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:30:19):**  If you really want to go with a financial return, that is fine.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:30:23):**  But if you really care about the impact, I think there are so many opportunities for  
**[0:30:28-0:30:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:30:28):**  you out there to back some of these emerging fund managers or emerging companies, social  
**[0:30:35-0:30:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:30:35):**  environmental enterprises out there that is actually really trying to do something great,  
**[0:30:39-0:30:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:30:39):**  trying to do something that's regenerative.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:30:42):**  Give them a chance.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:30:44):**  Your financial return may not be great or you may have to wait for a long time.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:30:48):**  They may be able to create huge positive impact on society.  
**[0:30:52-0:30:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:30:52):**  So fund those people and there are plenty of those out there that require funding.  
**[0:30:57-0:31:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:30:57):**  Yeah, and I can see that also as field building and of course with part of your portfolio,  
**[0:31:03-0:31:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:31:03):**  but be courageous there and maybe back once in a while something a bit less with a smaller  
**[0:31:11-0:31:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:31:11):**  track record or which could create a huge positive impact and might create, if everything  
**[0:31:19-0:31:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:31:19):**  goes well, of course also a financial return.  
**[0:31:23-0:31:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:31:23):**  Would that be your main advice?  
**[0:31:26-0:31:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:31:26):**  Because of course everybody that's listening to this podcast is already fully on board  
**[0:31:30-0:31:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:31:30):**  on regenerative agriculture and probably hopefully has sold all exposure to the Corn Belt and  
**[0:31:37-0:31:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:31:37):**  to GMO, soy and corn, etc.  
**[0:31:41-0:31:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:31:41):**  What would be your advice to the impact investors that are ready to get into this space?  
**[0:31:46-0:31:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:31:46):**  They have maybe part of their portfolio available for this, maybe the full one.  
**[0:31:53-0:31:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:31:53):**  How do you get exposure across the value chain basically to regenerative agriculture?  
**[0:31:59-0:32:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:31:59):**  Where should I start looking?  
**[0:32:03-0:32:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:32:03):**  I think it depends on the amount of capital that one has available.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:32:09):**  If one is more interested in making several small investments, then I think potentially  
**[0:32:17-0:32:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:32:17):**  there are some opportunities in the AgTech, agriculture technology space, that could be  
**[0:32:21-0:32:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:32:21):**  interesting.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:32:22):**  Some of them are actually very focused on trying to help farmers with practicing regenerative  
**[0:32:27-0:32:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:32:27):**  agriculture or a better way to understand the soil, etc.  
**[0:32:31-0:32:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:32:31):**  So there are companies like that.  
**[0:32:33-0:32:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:32:33):**  So I think that's one way to invest.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:32:36):**  If you're a family office with a sizable amount of capital that's readily available to invest,  
**[0:32:44-0:32:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:32:44):**  consider some of the real asset opportunities, backing, either doing it yourself or going  
**[0:32:49-0:32:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:32:49):**  through an investment fund that's trying to buy farmland and implement regenerative agriculture  
**[0:32:55-0:32:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:32:55):**  strategies.  
**[0:32:57-0:32:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:32:57):**  Back those people.  
**[0:32:58-0:33:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:32:58):**  There are some of them out there doing something that's very interesting, I think.  
**[0:33:04-0:33:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:33:04):**  So that will be one way to deploy the capital because obviously farmland is expensive and  
**[0:33:10-0:33:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:33:10):**  it's hard for us to convince the institutional investors, like we said at this time, to put  
**[0:33:15-0:33:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:33:15):**  money into those opportunities.  
**[0:33:16-0:33:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:33:16):**  So if you are a high net worth individual or a family office that's progressive, that's  
**[0:33:23-0:33:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:33:23):**  definitely the one space that I would look at.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:33:26):**  Great.

**[0:33:36-0:33:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:33:36):**  Yeah, I hope I will be wrong actually.

**[0:35:00-0:35:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:35:00):**  After a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of audio asking the question  
**[0:35:04-0:35:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:35:04):**  how to put money to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011  
**[0:35:09-0:35:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:35:09):**  and recording this podcast since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.

**[0:36:08-0:36:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:36:08):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.

**[0:36:20-0:36:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:36:20):**  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[0:36:25-0:36:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:36:25):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[0:36:28-0:36:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:36:28):**  Thank you.

**[0:36:30-0:36:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/28/renee-cheung/#t=0:36:30):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides

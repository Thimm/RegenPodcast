**[0:00:12-0:00:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:00:13):**  This is a deep dive into regenerative agriculture and food with an AgTech veteran.  
**[0:00:18-0:00:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:00:18):**  How to help farmers make better decisions.  
**[0:00:23-0:00:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:00:23):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture.  
**[0:00:27-0:00:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:00:27):**  Investing as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:29-0:00:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:00:29):**  This is the show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:33-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:00:33):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:00:38-0:00:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:00:38):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:43-0:00:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:00:43):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:45-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:00:45):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:00:49-0:00:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:00:49):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:00:51-0:00:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:00:51):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:00:56-0:01:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:00:56):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:01-0:01:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:01:01):**  In March last year, we launched our Patreon community to make it easy for fans to support

**[0:01:24-0:01:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:01:24):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:25-0:01:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:01:25):**  Today, I'm joined by Stephanie Reyes, founder of crop performance and earth labs, providing  
**[0:01:30-0:01:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:01:30):**  predictive analytics for agriculture, land and water resources, creating resilient landscapes  
**[0:01:34-0:01:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:01:34):**  and demystifying the science for farmers and helping farmers make better decisions.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:01:39):**  Welcome Stephanie.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:01:40):**  Hi, Koen.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:01:41):**  How are you?  
**[0:01:42-0:01:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:01:42):**  I'm really good.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:01:43):**  I'm very excited for this interview.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:01:44):**  We have a million and a half things to discuss, which we're never going to get to in one  
**[0:01:48-0:01:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:01:48):**  interview, but we have to get going.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:01:49):**  So I would love to ask you the first question I always ask and you've been listening to  
**[0:01:53-0:01:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:01:53):**  podcasts, so you know, how did you get into soil?  
**[0:01:56-0:01:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:01:56):**  Because it's, you weren't raised on a farm.  
**[0:01:58-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:01:58):**  You are not a farmer at the moment.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:02:00):**  How did you get to soil, region ag, water quality, et cetera?  
**[0:02:04-0:02:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:02:04):**  Okay.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:02:05):**  Thanks for having me today.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:02:06):**  I'm delighted to participate in your podcast series.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:02:09):**  I just wanted to, you know, commend you for your efforts to jump into a topic that we've  
**[0:02:15-0:02:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:02:15):**  been working in for about 10 years and continuing to educate the marketplace is a big piece  
**[0:02:21-0:02:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:02:21):**  of, of what needs to happen.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:02:24):**  So we got involved in soil health, water quality and greenhouse gas emissions monitoring at  
**[0:02:30-0:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:02:30):**  the very beginning of the company.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:02:31):**  My inspiration for crop performance had to do with my work previously in the supply chains  
**[0:02:38-0:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:02:38):**  of food and consumer products companies, where we understand that the food manufacturers  
**[0:02:44-0:02:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:02:44):**  need better visibility to their raw material supply and one of the key aspects of the data  
**[0:02:52-0:02:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:02:52):**  sets that they're clamoring for is to get a better understanding of commodity price  
**[0:02:56-0:03:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:02:56):**  fluctuation, which drives the margin of, of most food and consumer products companies.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:03:02):**  And that started to shift in, in 2008 and then we had a Walmart compliance mandate come  
**[0:03:07-0:03:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:03:07):**  back and say the top 50 suppliers to Walmart needed to supply sustainability analytics  
**[0:03:12-0:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:03:12):**  and none of the major food companies could agree as to what that meant and then what  
**[0:03:17-0:03:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:03:17):**  it meant to the growers that they were sourcing crops from to manufacture food products for  
**[0:03:23-0:03:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:03:23):**  consumers.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:03:24):**  So we decided at the very beginning that we needed to develop a robust set of metrics  
**[0:03:29-0:03:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:03:29):**  for something we were calling sustainable agriculture, which has now evolved to regenerative  
**[0:03:34-0:03:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:03:34):**  over the last, say eight years.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:03:36):**  And I can honestly say it has been a learning journey.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:03:39):**  We are, have progressed something from looking at a simple understanding of a problem set  
**[0:03:45-0:03:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:03:45):**  that said we need to become more resource efficient in the production of food by applying  
**[0:03:51-0:03:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:03:51):**  the right amount of fertilizer and water to get a crop to perform at a higher profit per  
**[0:03:57-0:04:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:03:57):**  acre, just a standard economic value proposition around resource use efficiency to actually  
**[0:04:02-0:04:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:04:02):**  defining a business case for soil health and the other externalities related to crop production.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:04:09):**  And this three tiered understanding, which is productivity, sustainability and risk management  
**[0:04:16-0:04:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:04:16):**  has now become the foundation for our company.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:04:19):**  Soil plays a role in everything that we do.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:04:22):**  We have soil fertility monitoring services, both for crop productivity as well as for  
**[0:04:29-0:04:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:04:29):**  soil carbon sequestration, as well as greenhouse gas emissions monitoring.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:04:35):**  So we use our soil monitoring technology as a fundamental part of the platform.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:04:40):**  And can you name an example of a very exciting client or a very exciting process you've been  
**[0:04:46-0:04:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:04:46):**  part of?  
**[0:04:47-0:04:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:04:47):**  How did you help farmers make better decisions?  
**[0:04:49-0:04:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:04:49):**  Could be one like quite a while ago when it was all much simpler and we were talking about  
**[0:04:53-0:04:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:04:53):**  sustainable agriculture, could be something on the region egg side very recently.  
**[0:04:56-0:05:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:04:56):**  But what would you share if you would have to share one?  
**[0:05:00-0:05:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:05:00):**  Yeah, we have several case studies.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:05:02):**  I would say we've been working the potato supply chain for about eight years for the  
**[0:05:08-0:05:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:05:08):**  major French fry and potato chip companies globally in a range of different geographies.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:05:14):**  And our work in North America started out by providing in season yield forecasts to  
**[0:05:22-0:05:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:05:22):**  understand what the yield was going to be at the end of the harvest and working with  
**[0:05:25-0:05:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:05:25):**  the potato growers in this consumer packaged goods company.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:05:29):**  Sorry to interrupt, but that basically means you're helping the potato chip manufacturer,  
**[0:05:33-0:05:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:05:33):**  the potato chip company to understand how many potatoes might be coming to the factory  
**[0:05:38-0:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:05:38):**  or what does that mean?  
**[0:05:40-0:05:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:05:40):**  It means how many potatoes from which field in which variety are going to be harvested  
**[0:05:46-0:05:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:05:46):**  when and when will they be available for use in a factory.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:05:51):**  So it's essentially supply planning all the way down to the field scale in their supply  
**[0:05:56-0:05:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:05:56):**  chain.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:05:57):**  They have an organization like ConAgra or PepsiCo that has something like up to 50 or  
**[0:06:05-0:06:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:06:05):**  100 potato growers in North America that supply five or 20 factories, depending upon what  
**[0:06:12-0:06:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:06:12):**  they're manufacturing.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:06:13):**  They have a supply plan and it's highly dependent upon what's in storage versus what's coming  
**[0:06:19-0:06:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:06:19):**  off the fields.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:06:20):**  And in the potato chip and French fry business, you're growing different potato varieties  
**[0:06:24-0:06:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:06:24):**  for different end uses.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:06:26):**  So understanding what the portfolio of available supply of any potato variety volume at any  
**[0:06:35-0:06:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:06:35):**  location becomes critical to the business.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:06:38):**  Absolutely fundamental.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:06:39):**  Yeah.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:06:40):**  Yeah.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:06:41):**  So it's more about minimizing supply chain disruption and working with growers on how  
**[0:06:46-0:06:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:06:46):**  to create a more profitable, reliable business.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:06:49):**  From the growers point of view, it's really about staying in business and staying out  
**[0:06:53-0:06:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:06:53):**  of trouble, the stuff about quantifying the environmental impact of food production is  
**[0:06:58-0:06:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:06:58):**  relatively new.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:06:59):**  When we started the company, we called it Earth Analytics Group thinking this is what  
**[0:07:04-0:07:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:07:04):**  we're doing, climate smart agriculture.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:07:08):**  And in 2013, we were encouraged by a number of growers to change the name of the company  
**[0:07:12-0:07:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:07:12):**  to crop performance because they really wanted us to focus on the business case for producing  
**[0:07:20-0:07:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:07:20):**  a higher yield of quality potatoes at a certain cost of production so they could stay in business  
**[0:07:27-0:07:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:07:27):**  and meet their customer commitments.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:07:29):**  So the job one was all about making them commercially reliable if they weren't to begin with.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:07:37):**  And I think that's a big missing gap in the discussion around regenerative.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:07:40):**  The question becomes, how does shifting from say conventional, how does that deliver on  
**[0:07:47-0:07:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:07:47):**  reliability of supply to make these growers more competitive because they need a business  
**[0:07:51-0:07:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:07:51):**  case?  
**[0:07:52-0:07:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:07:52):**  And I can't emphasize that enough.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:07:56):**  So back to the case study, I would say, while we started out with a simple view towards  
**[0:08:03-0:08:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:08:03):**  making the supply chain more reliable by providing the food processor with in-season yield forecasts  
**[0:08:09-0:08:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:08:09):**  and the growers with analytics tools to show them what was driving the variability in production  
**[0:08:16-0:08:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:08:16):**  in the crop yield on a field by field basis to advise them on, they've applied too much  
**[0:08:21-0:08:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:08:21):**  water too soon in the season, they get poor establishment or they've missed their nutrient  
**[0:08:26-0:08:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:08:26):**  application by two and a half weeks and they're not going to make their numbers as a result  
**[0:08:32-0:08:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:08:32):**  of that.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:08:33):**  Providing them with in-season tools to manage production at the field scale around something  
**[0:08:39-0:08:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:08:39):**  we call limiting factors, which are all the different attributes that growers look at  
**[0:08:45-0:08:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:08:45):**  in terms of things they can control.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:08:47):**  They can't control the weather, but they try and control soils and they try and control  
**[0:08:51-0:08:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:08:51):**  management, which involves irrigation, crop nutrition, crop protection.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:08:59):**  So back to the dials on the dashboard, I would say our biggest wins in terms of delivering  
**[0:09:06-0:09:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:09:06):**  the most value to our customers, both the food companies and the growers has been where  
**[0:09:10-0:09:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:09:10):**  we've been able to help growers anticipate and act in time to actually make a difference  
**[0:09:18-0:09:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:09:18):**  relative to their commercial commitments.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:09:21):**  Oftentimes in the United States and even in the UK and Europe, you'll see growers that  
**[0:09:28-0:09:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:09:28):**  struggle with something we call the resilience of their soils, meaning they want to future  
**[0:09:33-0:09:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:09:33):**  proof their farms so that they don't have surprises during the season.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:09:38):**  And that's really where our work in soils went from just managing soil fertility within  
**[0:09:43-0:09:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:09:43):**  a single season for a given crop, like a potato crop for potato chip manufacture, to something  
**[0:09:49-0:09:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:09:49):**  where we're looking at how can we plan soil fertility across multiple seasons on one field.  
**[0:09:55-0:09:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:09:55):**  So you get into the rotation side of things.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:09:57):**  I would love to unpack that further, but one step back, how do you get all that data from  
**[0:10:02-0:10:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:10:02):**  a specific field?  
**[0:10:03-0:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:10:03):**  Is that field visits, satellites, a lot of sensors?  
**[0:10:07-0:10:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:10:07):**  And how are you able to get the farmer and also the company obviously that's making the  
**[0:10:10-0:10:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:10:10):**  potato chips, that kind of detailed information?  
**[0:10:14-0:10:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:10:14):**  So we have three different data collection methods that come into one platform.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:10:20):**  So we have dynamic and static data.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:10:23):**  So the dynamic data is information about phenology of a given location, then meteorology and  
**[0:10:30-0:10:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:10:30):**  then soil.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:10:31):**  So we have three different dynamic data sets that are input to the platform.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:10:35):**  And then the static data sets, oftentimes we work with growers to record some level  
**[0:10:41-0:10:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:10:41):**  of past production.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:10:44):**  We know from our satellite remote sensing and our land use classification models, we  
**[0:10:49-0:10:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:10:49):**  can work out exactly what was growing where in a past season.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:10:52):**  So oftentimes we start a pilot project by running something we call a hindcast, which  
**[0:10:58-0:11:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:10:58):**  uses these dynamic data sets to mimic past seasons of production.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:11:03):**  And then we may or may not have access to grower management data, like how much water  
**[0:11:07-0:11:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:11:07):**  did they apply in irrigation?  
**[0:11:08-0:11:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:11:08):**  What crop protection, fertilizer or soil fertility treatments did they use in a given season?  
**[0:11:14-0:11:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:11:14):**  In order to play back to them, how much better could our system make them if they were using  
**[0:11:19-0:11:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:11:19):**  it in the past season of production?  
**[0:11:22-0:11:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:11:22):**  Basically going back and say, if you would have used us, we even without, you could even  
**[0:11:26-0:11:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:11:26):**  do that without asking them if you have access to this aerial data.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:11:30):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:11:31):**  So that is part of a, sometimes it's a pre-sales activity.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:11:35):**  Sometimes we get paid to do a hindcast, but it's essentially creating a retrospective  
**[0:11:40-0:11:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:11:40):**  view on the productivity of a given piece of land with the use of our platform.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:11:45):**  And then this year rotations become very interesting, obviously, as you can see changes, or you  
**[0:11:50-0:11:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:11:50):**  can start looking back slash predicting, okay, what happens if you take a longer view?  
**[0:11:55-0:12:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:11:55):**  Yeah, so we build that intelligence upfront on every project in the historical remote  
**[0:12:00-0:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:12:00):**  sensing archive that we developed over the past.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:12:03):**  The company's been going for about 10 years, but our historical data is about 40 years  
**[0:12:07-0:12:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:12:07):**  of historical data.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:12:08):**  And we started building it 10 years before I started the company.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:12:12):**  That's why this is a retrospective development of the data set becomes something that's really  
**[0:12:18-0:12:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:12:18):**  a differentiated capability for our company, not just for the past, say two or three years,  
**[0:12:23-0:12:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:12:23):**  but we can go back in time to run data against past seasons of production or past land use  
**[0:12:29-0:12:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:12:29):**  classes like in the case of a watershed, we might be looking at how many times did this  
**[0:12:35-0:12:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:12:35):**  land change from a forest to a grazing paddock for livestock to a vineyard, for example,  
**[0:12:43-0:12:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:12:43):**  and then how many times did it change back?  
**[0:12:45-0:12:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:12:45):**  Which on a landscape scale is extremely valuable.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:12:48):**  As you see many, I mean, I see many ag tech companies using many colleagues slash competitors  
**[0:12:54-0:12:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:12:54):**  looking at data for maybe two, three years.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:12:56):**  That's simply not enough, especially if you start looking at large, large water catchments,  
**[0:13:01-0:13:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:13:01):**  river systems, and being able to see what a forest to pasture to vineyard does to the  
**[0:13:07-0:13:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:13:07):**  soil.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:13:08):**  It's something you need 40, 50, 60, 100 years or a few basically.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:13:11):**  Yeah.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:13:12):**  And it's, we do more than just capturing static data.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:13:14):**  We run it through our model execution platform to provision the analytics.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:13:18):**  So we have three different layers of data, if you will.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:13:22):**  The first layer is both static and dynamic that can produce these hindcasts as well as  
**[0:13:26-0:13:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:13:26):**  nowcasts and forecast.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:13:28):**  I would say back to the case study, what we've done is transition some of these potato growers  
**[0:13:33-0:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:13:33):**  to regenerative practices where we're now incorporating soil fertility treatments and  
**[0:13:39-0:13:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:13:39):**  cover crops into the rotation, moving them to no-till system where they're not actively  
**[0:13:46-0:13:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:13:46):**  cultivating the soil in order to plant crops, minimizing disturbance, and in some cases  
**[0:13:53-0:13:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:13:53):**  incorporating livestock grazing into the rotation as a fertility treatment to see how we can  
**[0:13:58-0:14:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:13:58):**  increase the productivity of potatoes in a future season on a given field.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:14:03):**  So our work has transcended just looking at this as a two-dimensional problem.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:14:08):**  We need to monitor the productivity of crops on a field in a season and then job done to  
**[0:14:15-0:14:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:14:15):**  we're actually looking at a piece of land over the course of the rotation, which could  
**[0:14:21-0:14:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:14:21):**  be in the United States, a three-year rotation, in the UK or Europe, it could be an eight-year  
**[0:14:26-0:14:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:14:26):**  rotation.  
**[0:14:27-0:14:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:14:27):**  So it's two very different views.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:14:29):**  And as you, I mean, you've been around basically before Agtech probably was a thing or became  
**[0:14:35-0:14:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:14:35):**  a thing in Silicon Valley and became a thing for investors.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:14:38):**  You've seen a lot, you've heard a lot, you've probably met most people in this space.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:14:42):**  What would you tell the listeners to this podcast who are a big group of them are investors,  
**[0:14:48-0:14:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:14:48):**  they either investing their own capital, foundations, capital, family office capital, et cetera.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:14:53):**  Where would you see, as you see this, you mentioned the last two years, the region X  
**[0:14:56-0:15:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:14:56):**  space is exploding a lot of talk and work still needs to definitely catch up.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:15:02):**  Where would you tell them, obviously without giving investment advice to look, to start,  
**[0:15:07-0:15:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:15:07):**  to engage, where would you tell them to basically make the first steps if they want to be connected  
**[0:15:12-0:15:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:15:12):**  in, in, in so every generation?  
**[0:15:15-0:15:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:15:15):**  That's an interesting question that you pose.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:15:17):**  And so I'll give this a shot.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:15:18):**  I think investors in this space, whether they're Agtech investors or they're investors in specifically  
**[0:15:26-0:15:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:15:26):**  in region Ag or even in farmland investment need to take a systems view, a holistic perspective  
**[0:15:32-0:15:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:15:32):**  on understanding the value proposition of what the technology is actually, the science  
**[0:15:38-0:15:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:15:38):**  and technology is actually delivering to the end customer.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:15:42):**  If the end customer is, is it a primary producer, a grower, or if the customer is the entire  
**[0:15:48-0:15:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:15:48):**  supply chain, there's multiple value propositions.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:15:51):**  I think this, this whole notion of saying we have more diagnostics and we can detect  
**[0:15:57-0:16:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:15:57):**  and control soil diseases.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:16:00):**  That's interesting, but it's not a systems view.  
**[0:16:03-0:16:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:16:03):**  So looking at each individual technology almost as a point solution, those point solutions  
**[0:16:08-0:16:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:16:08):**  need to be brought together in order to deliver on, call it the holy grail of holistic management  
**[0:16:14-0:16:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:16:14):**  as it's, as it's characterized.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:16:17):**  But what it means is, is soil health means many things to many different people.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:16:21):**  And there've been many attempts to, to define what it is.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:16:25):**  I have some definitions here and some charts that basically represent what our customers  
**[0:16:29-0:16:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:16:29):**  think soil health is in the context of their objectives.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:16:33):**  And I think the challenge for investors in both technology companies, as well as in other  
**[0:16:39-0:16:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:16:39):**  assets, whether they're investing in a farming business or in a piece of farmland is, is  
**[0:16:45-0:16:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:16:45):**  to dig in to understand what those value propositions are of those investable entities as it relates  
**[0:16:52-0:16:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:16:52):**  to the outcomes.  
**[0:16:53-0:17:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:16:53):**  So an example might be looking at a soil disease diagnostic has value to individual growers  
**[0:17:03-0:17:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:17:03):**  because they can essentially minimize yield loss.  
**[0:17:06-0:17:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:17:06):**  But if you're a farmland investor, soil health means something very different to you.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:17:11):**  You're looking at the adaptive capacity of land.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:17:14):**  How do these tools and technologies actually improve the reliability of the crop that's  
**[0:17:18-0:17:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:17:18):**  being produced at a lower cost of production?  
**[0:17:22-0:17:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:17:22):**  And how does it support the tenants of what one calls regenerative agriculture?  
**[0:17:26-0:17:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:17:26):**  Things like minimizing soil disturbance through no till cultivations, keeping the soil covered  
**[0:17:31-0:17:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:17:31):**  at all times by complimenting main crops with cover crops to enhance soil fertility and  
**[0:17:36-0:17:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:17:36):**  employing species diversification of companion crops.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:17:40):**  And that could be cover crops or it could be cash crops in a sero rotation, or it could  
**[0:17:46-0:17:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:17:46):**  be growing different types of shade trees in a palm oil plantation.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:17:51):**  But the key tenant being you want to increase the diversity of soil microbes through the  
**[0:17:57-0:18:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:17:57):**  presence of pollinators and beneficial insects while at the same time you're increasing the  
**[0:18:02-0:18:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:18:02):**  diversity of the plant species or the crop species that you're growing on a given piece  
**[0:18:06-0:18:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:18:06):**  of land.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:18:07):**  So to answer the question, what do investors need to look for?  
**[0:18:10-0:18:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:18:10):**  They need to have some understanding of the biology of the farming system and what the  
**[0:18:15-0:18:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:18:15):**  outcomes are that the asset is purporting to either being able to measure or deliver  
**[0:18:22-0:18:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:18:22):**  upon depending upon if they're a tech company, a primary producer, like a food production  
**[0:18:29-0:18:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:18:29):**  company themselves, like a grower or a farmland investor.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:18:33):**  So I think I would break it down into those three pieces.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:18:37):**  And to ask a follow up question on that, what would you do if you would be in charge of,  
**[0:18:42-0:18:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:18:42):**  let's say a portfolio of 1 billion?  
**[0:18:45-0:18:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:18:45):**  So I'm deliberately putting a crazy amount of money out there, which is out there in  
**[0:18:49-0:18:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:18:49):**  terms of investment capital, but because I want the sector to start thinking about those  
**[0:18:53-0:19:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:18:53):**  numbers as we start approaching larger scale institutional investors that are asking questions  
**[0:19:00-0:19:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:19:00):**  about 10, 20, 100, in some cases 500 million.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:19:03):**  So what would you do if you would tomorrow morning be in charge of this fund as an investment,  
**[0:19:08-0:19:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:19:08):**  so it's an investment fund with 1 billion under management?  
**[0:19:12-0:19:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:19:12):**  I think the first thing that I would ask my LPs about is, is this an early stage fund?  
**[0:19:18-0:19:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:19:18):**  If it's a billion dollars, you're looking at typically like PE later stage deals as  
**[0:19:23-0:19:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:19:23):**  opposed to having a portfolio of early, middle and late stage funds.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:19:28):**  So the investment thesis of such a fund, if it's a billion.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:19:32):**  Let's say you wake up, it's your personal finance.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:19:34):**  What would you do?  
**[0:19:35-0:19:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:19:35):**  What would I do?  
**[0:19:36-0:19:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:19:36):**  You can do whatever you want with it.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:19:37):**  Okay, so I would design it so that it was doing all three things.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:19:39):**  So it would do multiple stages as opposed to restricting myself to a given stage.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:19:44):**  So I would allocate capital to early growth and later stage deals.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:19:51):**  The tech space is very slow to mature given adoption of the growers and understanding  
**[0:19:58-0:20:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:19:58):**  all the different measurement technologies and the application of science.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:20:01):**  I think we're going to see a lot of inflated valuations of companies that are being forced  
**[0:20:07-0:20:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:20:07):**  to raise more money than they need in order to have a real business in terms of revenue  
**[0:20:11-0:20:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:20:11):**  and profit.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:20:14):**  So you would stay out of a lot of those deals, I imagine.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:20:16):**  I would get into them, but in smaller rounds.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:20:19):**  So the average deal size would be smaller rounds for Agtech and I would have more business  
**[0:20:24-0:20:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:20:24):**  fundamentals in terms of how I was evaluating the performance of each one of those assets.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:20:28):**  And if it was me managing the fund, we pretty much know the market.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:20:34):**  We would look to encourage B rounds of different companies that we thought had complimentary  
**[0:20:40-0:20:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:20:40):**  technologies that we could string together in an ecosystem play.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:20:46):**  One of the investors that we've been talking to recently, they said, well, that looks like  
**[0:20:48-0:20:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:20:48):**  what you've developed here.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:20:50):**  And OK, so we have the whole block of Swiss cheese and here are the holes.  
**[0:20:55-0:20:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:20:55):**  And these are the companies that we think fill these gaps.  
**[0:20:57-0:21:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:20:57):**  So how does the industry move forward?  
**[0:21:00-0:21:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:21:00):**  And what is the role of a billion dollar fund in moving the tech piece of this forward in  
**[0:21:05-0:21:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:21:05):**  the context of adoption with growers?  
**[0:21:07-0:21:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:21:07):**  I think there's an interesting exercise and it's more than an academic exercise that I  
**[0:21:12-0:21:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:21:12):**  would be willing to facilitate with a group of Agtech investors to show them what's missing  
**[0:21:17-0:21:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:21:17):**  in such an ecosystem play.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:21:18):**  And I think the industry really needs that.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:21:20):**  It doesn't need another fund.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:21:21):**  It needs a rationalization exercise to take place that's more about making sense out of  
**[0:21:28-0:21:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:21:28):**  the solutions that have been developed as opposed to going after down rounds for companies  
**[0:21:33-0:21:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:21:33):**  that have inflated valuation.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:21:35):**  So that I don't know if that answers part of your question.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:21:40):**  The other part of the fund I would be focused on is tying some of these tools, particularly  
**[0:21:45-0:21:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:21:45):**  the ones on regenerative agriculture and soil health to transition finance for regenerative,  
**[0:21:50-0:21:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:21:50):**  because one of the adoption things that we've seen just with pure Agtech is that it's slow  
**[0:21:54-0:21:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:21:54):**  because they want to see results before they buy into an annual recurring revenue.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:21:59):**  And so all these startups are are choking on one in 200K deals in order to get the run  
**[0:22:05-0:22:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:22:05):**  rates that investors want to see.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:22:08):**  You have to have more annual recurring revenue.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:22:09):**  And the only way you're going to get there is through trying to scale some of the technology.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:22:14):**  Regenerative agriculture is no different.  
**[0:22:16-0:22:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:22:16):**  I mean, the technologies are a bit different.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:22:19):**  The growers are typically more, how would I say this, evolved in their thinking, meaning  
**[0:22:23-0:22:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:22:23):**  they're more open to change.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:22:25):**  And they've been experimenting with different techniques for a very long time.  
**[0:22:28-0:22:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:22:28):**  The fact that we now have tools to codify and validate and provide scientific evidence  
**[0:22:33-0:22:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:22:33):**  around some of these regenerative agriculture practices, I think is the phase that we're  
**[0:22:38-0:22:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:22:38):**  in now.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:22:39):**  So part of the fund I would use for transition finance for growers moving from what you might  
**[0:22:46-0:22:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:22:46):**  characterize as conventional or sustainable to regenerative practices.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:22:50):**  And then the third piece of the fund I would use and allocate to activities to join up  
**[0:22:56-0:23:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:22:56):**  the Agtech piece with the farmland investment community, who is doing a fantastic job as  
**[0:23:02-0:23:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:23:02):**  asset managers.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:23:03):**  But many of the business models of the farmland investment community are focused on managing  
**[0:23:10-0:23:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:23:10):**  assets like you would manage a REIT, a real estate investment trust.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:23:14):**  And they're still missing the piece on understanding how farm economics actually creates more value  
**[0:23:21-0:23:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:23:21):**  in the sale of the property.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:23:23):**  Because a lot of those land valuations are tied directly to inflation as opposed to the  
**[0:23:29-0:23:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:23:29):**  productive capacity of land and how do you achieve that potential given the change in  
**[0:23:36-0:23:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:23:36):**  to regenerative practices.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:23:37):**  So I think there's a very big opportunity there.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:23:39):**  But that's what I would do with a billion dollars.  
**[0:23:41-0:23:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:23:41):**  And if anyone's out there and wants to give me the money to do it, I'm ready to talk.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:23:45):**  I'll give them your email.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:23:47):**  Yes.  
**[0:23:48-0:23:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:23:48):**  And let's say with the third or the transition finance, how would you approach that?  
**[0:23:55-0:23:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:23:55):**  Because it's something that keeps coming back, obviously, we're doing a series here on that  
**[0:23:59-0:24:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:23:59):**  specific topic.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:24:01):**  How would you approach if you had, let's say, 300 million or something in the neighborhood  
**[0:24:05-0:24:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:24:05):**  to put to work to help transition farmers that want to transition, but maybe miss the  
**[0:24:10-0:24:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:24:10):**  finance part of it?  
**[0:24:11-0:24:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:24:11):**  Yeah, I think part of it is meeting people where they are and understanding where the  
**[0:24:16-0:24:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:24:16):**  starting point is.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:24:18):**  And you go through a segmentation exercise of understanding, you know, what is the history  
**[0:24:23-0:24:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:24:23):**  of crop production?  
**[0:24:25-0:24:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:24:25):**  So it's not just dimensionalized by size of farm and what are they growing and what's  
**[0:24:29-0:24:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:24:29):**  the nature of the rotation.  
**[0:24:31-0:24:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:24:31):**  But what ambition do they have either on the revenue side of the equation or on profit?  
**[0:24:38-0:24:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:24:38):**  So there are a number of large farming organizations in North America that are, you know, of the  
**[0:24:45-0:24:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:24:45):**  mindset that bigger is better.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:24:47):**  And we've worked with a number of them to actually grow more profitable crops on less  
**[0:24:54-0:24:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:24:54):**  land.  
**[0:24:55-0:24:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:24:55):**  So their costs go down, their margin goes up, but the revenue might also be smaller.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:24:59):**  So getting an understanding of the segmentation of the producers based upon their business  
**[0:25:04-0:25:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:25:04):**  objectives becomes really important.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:25:06):**  Is it growth or is it margin or is it both in terms of what they're after?  
**[0:25:11-0:25:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:25:11):**  And who owns them, I think, is the other thing.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:25:13):**  Are they family owned and operated?  
**[0:25:15-0:25:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:25:15):**  Do they own the land?  
**[0:25:16-0:25:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:25:16):**  Or are they renting land from either third parties that are growers or third parties  
**[0:25:22-0:25:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:25:22):**  that are investment companies?  
**[0:25:23-0:25:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:25:23):**  So getting your arms around the segmentation of the profile of the growers that would be  
**[0:25:30-0:25:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:25:30):**  involved in such a program for 300 million.  
**[0:25:34-0:25:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:25:34):**  And then there needs to be incentives for them.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:25:36):**  So it's not just here we'll pay you, you know, a certain amount per acre of land converted  
**[0:25:43-0:25:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:25:43):**  to regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:25:44):**  It should tie to the value that they're getting off of the program.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:25:48):**  So you have to devise a, we call it a regenerative agriculture roadmap and implementation plan.  
**[0:25:55-0:26:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:25:55):**  We just wrote one early this morning for a farm in the UK that's got 5,500 hectares of  
**[0:26:01-0:26:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:26:01):**  cropland and a thousand hectares of permanent pasture for grazing a thousand sheep.  
**[0:26:06-0:26:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:26:06):**  Not small.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:26:07):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:26:08):**  Not small.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:26:09):**  Well, it's a good size operator for this geography.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:26:12):**  But in the US it would be very small.  
**[0:26:15-0:26:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:26:15):**  Of course, of course.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:26:16):**  In terms of the condition and the context, it's not small for.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:26:19):**  So how I would start with a 300 million transition finance business plan, if you will, is I would  
**[0:26:26-0:26:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:26:26):**  come up with the segmentation for who are the interested parties and how many of them  
**[0:26:31-0:26:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:26:31):**  are there to understand what the total adjustable market is given my fund size.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:26:35):**  And then how do I get them all adopted and achieving some return on investment within,  
**[0:26:42-0:26:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:26:42):**  say three years time, as opposed to 10 years time or 11 years time or 12 years time.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:26:47):**  If we go back and look at our own experience in implementing some of these soil health  
**[0:26:51-0:26:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:26:51):**  programs across the rotation, we have examples where we've delivered a hundred percent benefits  
**[0:26:56-0:26:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:26:56):**  in 24 months.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:26:58):**  We have other examples where it took us almost 10 years to get to the same spot.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:27:03):**  And the producers may not be calling those projects regenerative agriculture projects  
**[0:27:08-0:27:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:27:08):**  because it's terminology that they may not be familiar with.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:27:12):**  So what they're interested in doing is figuring out how they can manipulate soil biology to  
**[0:27:19-0:27:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:27:19):**  lower their cost of production and have a more reliable crop is basically what it comes  
**[0:27:25-0:27:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:27:25):**  down to.  
**[0:27:27-0:27:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:27:27):**  Getting them out of the thinking that they can just add soil microbes and magic happens.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:27:32):**  It's like convincing somebody not to take a diet pill because they need to do the hard  
**[0:27:36-0:27:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:27:36):**  work.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:27:37):**  Yeah, it's kind of like that.  
**[0:27:40-0:27:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:27:40):**  But yeah, that's what I would do with the 300 million.  
**[0:27:43-0:27:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:27:43):**  You'd have to profile and figure out which growers you want to approach and how many  
**[0:27:49-0:27:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:27:49):**  of them are.  
**[0:27:50-0:27:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:27:50):**  And if it would be you, what kind of where would you go first and what kind of crops  
**[0:27:56-0:28:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:27:56):**  or what kind of situations do you think are the most exciting at the moment?  
**[0:28:00-0:28:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:28:00):**  I think there's five different places and geographies and cropping systems to consider.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:28:07):**  And it all depends upon what you're trying to achieve for your limited partners.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:28:11):**  I think the first in this case, you're the only limited partner.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:28:14):**  So you can what do you want?  
**[0:28:16-0:28:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:28:16):**  Okay, it's my money.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:28:17):**  Okay, you really put me on the spot here.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:28:18):**  I think that's my job.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:28:22):**  The five different scenarios are the United States where you have, you know, two thirds  
**[0:28:27-0:28:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:28:27):**  of the country growing corn and soybeans and maybe some small grains intermixed with, you  
**[0:28:32-0:28:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:28:32):**  know, field vegetables and then specialty crops primarily in places like California  
**[0:28:38-0:28:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:28:38):**  and the West Coast is a very different starting point than a place like Australia where you  
**[0:28:45-0:28:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:28:45):**  have a lot of regenerative agriculture already going on given the grazing and what they've  
**[0:28:50-0:28:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:28:50):**  done with cereal production.  
**[0:28:51-0:28:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:28:51):**  However, they could be doing a better job of integrating those two things together and  
**[0:28:55-0:28:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:28:55):**  increasing the productive capacity of where they're growing wheat and growing the right  
**[0:28:59-0:29:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:28:59):**  varieties that are more drought resilient and creating more resilience to water.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:29:07):**  I mean, Australia has been in a drought for a long time, but there's some of the smartest  
**[0:29:11-0:29:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:29:11):**  people in the world there working on strategies to keep the water cycle moving, which is the  
**[0:29:20-0:29:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:29:20):**  whole reason why we're having the fires there now.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:29:23):**  I would say that's a very different scenario than Northern Europe where we are today in  
**[0:29:28-0:29:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:29:28):**  the UK or even in the Netherlands where you have a very broad diversity of soils because  
**[0:29:36-0:29:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:29:36):**  they've been farming here for 3000 years.  
**[0:29:39-0:29:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:29:39):**  So there's a lot of biological diversity of soils.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:29:42):**  In particular, you have a lot of diseases that present limiting factors to things like  
**[0:29:47-0:29:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:29:47):**  potato production.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:29:48):**  So an example is a potato systematode or soil fusarium or F. myces for peas.  
**[0:29:54-0:30:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:29:54):**  So you have a lot of challenges with yield decline given improper management of soils  
**[0:30:00-0:30:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:30:00):**  in long rotations.  
**[0:30:03-0:30:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:30:03):**  The other geographies are Sub-Saharan Africa and the last one would be Southeast Asia.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:30:09):**  So in Sub-Saharan Africa, you have a huge opportunity to use regenerative agriculture  
**[0:30:15-0:30:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:30:15):**  practices to build and design the right fertility profiles of soils to grow different crops  
**[0:30:20-0:30:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:30:20):**  in different conditions.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:30:23):**  So I mean, it's like starting on day one, how would you grow barley for a beer supply  
**[0:30:30-0:30:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:30:30):**  chain?  
**[0:30:31-0:30:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:30:31):**  What varieties do you need?  
**[0:30:32-0:30:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:30:32):**  You have access to water and where would you put a beer manufacturing, a miller and a brewery  
**[0:30:41-0:30:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:30:41):**  for the product?  
**[0:30:42-0:30:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:30:42):**  So the African continent represents a frontier.  
**[0:30:46-0:30:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:30:46):**  We do some work there and most of it's around setting up vertically integrated supply chains  
**[0:30:51-0:30:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:30:51):**  for smallholder farmers that are part of outgrower networks that tie to a commercial farm that  
**[0:30:56-0:31:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:30:56):**  then ties to some food or beverage processing to consumers.  
**[0:31:02-0:31:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:31:02):**  So we see the African continent as being a very interesting place to deploy regenerative  
**[0:31:07-0:31:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:31:07):**  agriculture practices.  
**[0:31:09-0:31:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:31:09):**  And then I think Indonesia and places in the Southeast Asia present challenging environments  
**[0:31:16-0:31:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:31:16):**  for moving from monoculture.  
**[0:31:20-0:31:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:31:20):**  Things like palm oil and rubber plantations to regenerative perennial tropical systems  
**[0:31:29-0:31:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:31:29):**  that have many more constraints around biodiversity and habitat and deforestation risk given all  
**[0:31:37-0:31:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:31:37):**  of the activity around land use change.  
**[0:31:40-0:31:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:31:40):**  So one of the big reasons for the slash and burn in both Brazil and Indonesia, and we're  
**[0:31:45-0:31:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:31:45):**  working in both places now, is down to not getting, optimizing the productivity of the  
**[0:31:55-0:32:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:31:55):**  commodity and the plantations so they clear more land in order to grow more of the crop.  
**[0:32:00-0:32:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:32:00):**  So we think regenerative agriculture has a strategic role in the context of those farming  
**[0:32:05-0:32:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:32:05):**  systems to increase the adaptive capacity of the plantation by diversifying the number  
**[0:32:11-0:32:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:32:11):**  of crops that are actually grown in that geography.  
**[0:32:15-0:32:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:32:15):**  I think one of the critical components is the governance and the legislation and how  
**[0:32:22-0:32:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:32:22):**  that gets implemented in those geographies.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:32:24):**  They're developing countries and you need to provide economic opportunity for the smallholder  
**[0:32:29-0:32:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:32:29):**  farmers on the ground.  
**[0:32:31-0:32:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:32:31):**  The other aspect is the biodiversity and habitat.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:32:34):**  There's a large number of endangered species in those geographies that need to be protected.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:32:40):**  Good news is that we can plan and implement for all of that in the context of having something  
**[0:32:48-0:32:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:32:48):**  that works.  
**[0:32:49-0:32:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:32:49):**  So it doesn't need to be all swung in the other direction, which is to conservation  
**[0:32:55-0:33:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:32:55):**  and setting aside all of the land and not doing anything with it.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:33:00):**  It's more about getting really creative with how you preserve the natural landscape in  
**[0:33:05-0:33:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:33:05):**  the context of valuing the externalities.  
**[0:33:08-0:33:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:33:08):**  In the case of Indonesia, the value of natural capital is much higher than it would be in  
**[0:33:13-0:33:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:33:13):**  Arizona just based upon the diversity of species that are in that geography.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:33:21):**  So it's a longer question you asked me.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:33:26):**  So what would you do first?  
**[0:33:28-0:33:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:33:28):**  You really need to understand the characterization of the farming system as well as the natural  
**[0:33:34-0:33:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:33:34):**  environment in which it exists in order to prioritize where regenerative agriculture  
**[0:33:39-0:33:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:33:39):**  can play the biggest role in terms of creating not just nature-based solutions, but business  
**[0:33:46-0:33:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:33:46):**  benefits for the producers.  
**[0:33:47-0:33:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:33:47):**  Yeah, I think that's the role of any investor.  
**[0:33:51-0:33:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:33:51):**  If somebody has a billion or not, or 10 euros or $10 is to see where are those leverage  
**[0:33:57-0:34:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:33:57):**  points where in the context of you as an investor, but obviously also in the context of where  
**[0:34:02-0:34:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:34:02):**  you are interacting with and how can you put that to work in something diversified, obviously  
**[0:34:07-0:34:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:34:07):**  from the risk perspective, but also to have potential exposure to things that are going  
**[0:34:12-0:34:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:34:12):**  to happen over the next years.  
**[0:34:13-0:34:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:34:13):**  We're going to see more shocks.  
**[0:34:14-0:34:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:34:14):**  We're going to see more opportunities either on nutrient density, either on ecosystem services  
**[0:34:18-0:34:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:34:18):**  and payments.  
**[0:34:19-0:34:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:34:19):**  We might finally going to see more and more carbon payments and water payments and biodiversity  
**[0:34:24-0:34:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:34:24):**  payments, et cetera, which some pieces are there yet and they might come, just we don't  
**[0:34:29-0:34:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:34:29):**  know when and how they exactly are going to be implemented.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:34:31):**  So you would like to have exposure to that, obviously without running enormous risks.  
**[0:34:37-0:34:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:34:37):**  It's the constant play in something that is very biological and growing and emerging.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:34:41):**  Ten years ago or two years ago, it was completely different.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:34:44):**  I think the challenge there is where the revenue streams and the development of markets around  
**[0:34:49-0:34:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:34:49):**  natural capital.  
**[0:34:51-0:34:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:34:51):**  It's been a long time coming.  
**[0:34:52-0:34:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:34:52):**  We've been doing this work for 10 years and my CFO keeps telling me, stop working on that.  
**[0:34:58-0:35:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:34:58):**  Nobody's putting, nobody's voting with their balance sheet yet.  
**[0:35:02-0:35:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:35:02):**  Do you think it's the year 2020?  
**[0:35:03-0:35:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:35:03):**  We're at the beginning now.  
**[0:35:04-0:35:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:35:04):**  Is this year already there?  
**[0:35:05-0:35:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:35:05):**  Because we've quantified it and we have a data set for most major geographies on a lot  
**[0:35:11-0:35:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:35:11):**  of the externalities of different production outcomes.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:35:14):**  The projects where we've been provisioning that data and creating value for producers  
**[0:35:19-0:35:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:35:19):**  have been around lawsuits for nitrate leaching and renegotiating laws around erosion and  
**[0:35:26-0:35:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:35:26):**  sediment transport.  
**[0:35:27-0:35:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:35:27):**  It's all been backwards, if you will.  
**[0:35:30-0:35:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:35:30):**  Thinking about litigation risk, it's like the climate risk discussion.  
**[0:35:36-0:35:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:35:36):**  You have litigation risk and quantifying that as well as how could climate disrupt your  
**[0:35:43-0:35:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:35:43):**  business, meaning you have no revenue as a result of having stranded assets.  
**[0:35:49-0:35:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:35:49):**  I think the financial services community is further along and they're thinking about risk  
**[0:35:54-0:35:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:35:54):**  than the agricultural community, which views risk really in the context of staying alive.  
**[0:35:59-0:36:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:35:59):**  If you can risk as a hail storm or something like that, it happens every now and then.  
**[0:36:06-0:36:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:36:06):**  You get insurance.  
**[0:36:08-0:36:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:36:08):**  We do provide data sets that are used for crop insurance.  
**[0:36:11-0:36:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:36:11):**  We have our own crop insurance products.  
**[0:36:14-0:36:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:36:14):**  Most of that's around drought, pests and disease.  
**[0:36:17-0:36:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:36:17):**  We've developed some parametric products that essentially finance the mitigation in advance  
**[0:36:23-0:36:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:36:23):**  of the loss so that there is no loss.  
**[0:36:26-0:36:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:36:26):**  It's not a premium in a claim like a multi-parallel crop insurance product.  
**[0:36:30-0:36:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:36:30):**  It's a parametric product that gets financed somehow either through an insurance company.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:36:36):**  Sometimes it's coming through the supply chain and supply chain finance from the buyer of  
**[0:36:41-0:36:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:36:41):**  tea that finances supplemental irrigation to producers of tea, the farmers themselves,  
**[0:36:48-0:36:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:36:48):**  to have access to irrigation for a period of time so they don't have a crop failure.  
**[0:36:52-0:36:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:36:52):**  Give an example in Kenya where we spend $5 million on supplemental irrigation, which  
**[0:36:57-0:37:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:36:57):**  prevented a $500 million problem with the supply of the crop in the commodity market,  
**[0:37:04-0:37:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:37:04):**  which represented something like 20% of the world's tea supply.  
**[0:37:08-0:37:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:37:08):**  Parametric insurance does play a role with agricultural commodities given climate change.  
**[0:37:15-0:37:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:37:15):**  I think that the challenge with looking at risk in the context of climate from how the  
**[0:37:23-0:37:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:37:23):**  banks think about it and how the regulatory community thinks about it, they're thinking  
**[0:37:28-0:37:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:37:28):**  more about catastrophic risk as it relates to physical assets on landscape and less about  
**[0:37:33-0:37:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:37:33):**  natural capital.  
**[0:37:34-0:37:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:37:34):**  I think the reason for that is they don't understand natural capital.  
**[0:37:37-0:37:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:37:37):**  It's like trying to teach bankers how to be farmers.  
**[0:37:41-0:37:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:37:41):**  Which is very, very difficult.  
**[0:37:42-0:37:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:37:42):**  Yeah.  
**[0:37:43-0:37:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:37:43):**  It's a whole growing problem.  
**[0:37:44-0:37:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:37:44):**  We've been doing a lot of it.  
**[0:37:46-0:37:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:37:46):**  I said before this call, we're on the call talking about the past, the early investors  
**[0:37:52-0:37:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:37:52):**  that we pitched for this company.  
**[0:37:54-0:37:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:37:54):**  And so- They did a lot of education.  
**[0:37:56-0:37:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:37:56):**  They said, you're actually going to go work with the farms?  
**[0:37:58-0:38:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:37:58):**  What are you, crazy?  
**[0:38:00-0:38:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:38:00):**  And now all the bankers are coming to us and saying, can you tell us about soil health?  
**[0:38:03-0:38:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:38:03):**  So it's interesting.  
**[0:38:05-0:38:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:38:05):**  It's all flipped around.  
**[0:38:06-0:38:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:38:06):**  We came a long way.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:38:07):**  Yeah.  
**[0:38:08-0:38:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:38:08):**  Yes.  
**[0:38:09-0:38:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:38:09):**  I want to be conscious of your time.  
**[0:38:10-0:38:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:38:10):**  And this is not the last time we're talking, I imagine.  
**[0:38:13-0:38:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:38:13):**  So I want to finalize with some questions.  
**[0:38:16-0:38:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:38:16):**  And the first one, if you could have a magic wand and tomorrow morning we wake up and Stephanie  
**[0:38:21-0:38:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:38:21):**  has changed one thing in the agriculture industry or the food industry, what would that be?  
**[0:38:26-0:38:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:38:26):**  It's a very good question.  
**[0:38:29-0:38:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:38:29):**  I would say implementing some of the scientific innovation that we've created at scale so  
**[0:38:34-0:38:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:38:34):**  that these methods start to take off.  
**[0:38:38-0:38:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:38:38):**  And examples of that are being able to sequence the DNA of the air to identify evidence of  
**[0:38:45-0:38:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:38:45):**  inoculum and in situ infection conditions for meteorology to inform disease risk.  
**[0:38:51-0:38:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:38:51):**  And then actually proactively come up with crop protection programs that are fit for  
**[0:38:58-0:39:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:38:58):**  purpose given different disease risk profiles globally.  
**[0:39:01-0:39:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:39:01):**  What does it mean in plain English?  
**[0:39:03-0:39:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:39:03):**  In plain English, what all that means is we can detect things in the environment that  
**[0:39:09-0:39:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:39:09):**  growers can't see, that if they were using the information, they would lower their carbon  
**[0:39:14-0:39:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:39:14):**  footprint of the food production process and it would save them a lot of money.  
**[0:39:21-0:39:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:39:21):**  What I'm saying to you is I think the industry, both ag tech as well as the region ag space,  
**[0:39:28-0:39:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:39:28):**  they're all focused on trying to understand how to quantify soil carbon, how to understand  
**[0:39:36-0:39:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:39:36):**  the relationship between soil health and crop productivity.  
**[0:39:40-0:39:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:39:40):**  But not many people are looking at cost and risk in the context of the balance sheet of  
**[0:39:45-0:39:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:39:45):**  the producers, which is essentially the starting point for where these producers are coming  
**[0:39:49-0:39:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:39:49):**  from.  
**[0:39:50-0:39:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:39:50):**  So what would make me most satisfied in terms of our work in the marketplace is to have  
**[0:39:56-0:40:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:39:56):**  some of these innovations scale, not just on the implementation of the technology, but  
**[0:40:01-0:40:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:40:01):**  also on the value that we're creating on the balance sheets of the producers and their  
**[0:40:05-0:40:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:40:05):**  customers in the supply chain.  
**[0:40:07-0:40:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:40:07):**  And what do you believe to be true about regenerative agriculture that others don't believe to be  
**[0:40:12-0:40:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:40:12):**  true?  
**[0:40:13-0:40:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:40:13):**  And this question definitely is inspired by John Kemp, who uses it very often in his podcast.  
**[0:40:18-0:40:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:40:18):**  Okay.  
**[0:40:19-0:40:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:40:19):**  So I think this is really hard because I'm not sure how many people would agree with  
**[0:40:23-0:40:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:40:23):**  what I have to say.  
**[0:40:24-0:40:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:40:24):**  But that's exactly the point.  
**[0:40:28-0:40:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:40:28):**  Everyone's talking about regenerative agriculture, starting with grazing, incorporating livestock  
**[0:40:33-0:40:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:40:33):**  into a rotation, whether it's cattle on grass, pigs on stubble, turnips, chickens, whatever  
**[0:40:41-0:40:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:40:41):**  it is.  
**[0:40:42-0:40:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:40:42):**  We've experimented with different holistic management practices in different farming  
**[0:40:48-0:40:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:40:48):**  systems, both on permanent pasture, independent of a cropping system for say cereals or field  
**[0:40:54-0:40:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:40:54):**  vegetables.  
**[0:40:55-0:40:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:40:55):**  And then we've done these integrated projects where we're looking at the efficacy of grazing  
**[0:40:59-0:41:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:40:59):**  on soil fertility, soil structure, and water holding capacity and how that improves productivity  
**[0:41:05-0:41:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:41:05):**  of the land in subsequent years of growing a crop on a piece of land that was grazed.  
**[0:41:12-0:41:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:41:12):**  So I don't think that there's enough discussion about the whole systems approach, which includes  
**[0:41:21-0:41:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:41:21):**  livestock as a complimentary attribute of an arable cropping system.  
**[0:41:27-0:41:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:41:27):**  I think understanding the interplay between these two things is essential in terms of  
**[0:41:33-0:41:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:41:33):**  how we bring arable farmland in terms of soil fertility to the place where it needs to be  
**[0:41:39-0:41:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:41:39):**  the fastest.  
**[0:41:40-0:41:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:41:40):**  And I think the reason for this is many of the cereal and vegetable farmers don't necessarily  
**[0:41:46-0:41:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:41:46):**  want to manage livestock because they've specialized in their own methods and they view livestock  
**[0:41:51-0:41:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:41:51):**  as a drag on their P&L.  
**[0:41:53-0:41:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:41:53):**  And a lot of work.  
**[0:41:54-0:41:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:41:54):**  Yes, a lot of work.  
**[0:41:55-0:41:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:41:55):**  You got to be there.  
**[0:41:56-0:41:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:41:56):**  And a very different work, obviously, from something they have been specialized in the  
**[0:41:59-0:42:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:41:59):**  last 20, 30 years.  
**[0:42:00-0:42:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:42:00):**  Maybe if you went to their fathers or their grandfathers, it would be a different thing.  
**[0:42:03-0:42:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:42:03):**  But for them.  
**[0:42:04-0:42:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:42:04):**  Yeah.  
**[0:42:05-0:42:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:42:05):**  And so I think there's an opportunity there for livestock producers to rent out their  
**[0:42:09-0:42:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:42:09):**  cattle and services.  
**[0:42:10-0:42:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:42:10):**  And we've helped a number of them do that actually here in the UK to provide soil fertility  
**[0:42:14-0:42:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:42:14):**  services where they graze their cattle on somebody else's land on a say a four year  
**[0:42:19-0:42:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:42:19):**  lay and then they get paid on the nutrient benefits of what has been created in the future  
**[0:42:24-0:42:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:42:24):**  season of production in terms of soil health.  
**[0:42:27-0:42:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:42:27):**  I always do this.  
**[0:42:28-0:42:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:42:28):**  It's the last question I say, but it's actually not.  
**[0:42:30-0:42:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:42:30):**  How did that work?  
**[0:42:31-0:42:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:42:31):**  So you helped a livestock grazer basically get a contract with an arable farmer and then  
**[0:42:37-0:42:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:42:37):**  the payment was connected to the nutrients the livestock brought to the farm.  
**[0:42:41-0:42:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:42:41):**  That's right.  
**[0:42:42-0:42:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:42:42):**  As measured by the productivity improvement of the crops in a subsequent season of growing.  
**[0:42:48-0:42:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:42:48):**  But you need to be able to connect that to the livestock.  
**[0:42:51-0:42:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:42:51):**  It cannot be something else.  
**[0:42:52-0:42:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:42:52):**  Otherwise the farmer says, yeah, but actually it was my fertilizer or it was my management  
**[0:42:56-0:42:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:42:56):**  or et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:42:57-0:42:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:42:57):**  Yeah.  
**[0:42:58-0:43:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:42:58):**  So we do measurements like before and after the grass was laid, was planted.  
**[0:43:03-0:43:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:43:03):**  We ran the monitoring program for the cattle grazing on the piece of land.  
**[0:43:08-0:43:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:43:08):**  And so we understand how much soil organic matter was built up over what period of time.  
**[0:43:13-0:43:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:43:13):**  And it's the attribution of that management practice to the rotation, which we have in  
**[0:43:17-0:43:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:43:17):**  our analytics platform.  
**[0:43:20-0:43:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:43:20):**  It's essentially a way to forecast how much of the future benefit can be attributed to  
**[0:43:25-0:43:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:43:25):**  the livestock grazing versus what crop he grew in between.  
**[0:43:29-0:43:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:43:29):**  Now being able to discern like one thing from the next, now we're getting into, I say the  
**[0:43:34-0:43:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:43:34):**  weeds, but we're getting into the details of how that-  
**[0:43:38-0:43:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:43:38):**  Unintended.  
**[0:43:39-0:43:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:43:39):**  Yeah.  
**[0:43:40-0:43:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:43:40):**  Pun unintended, unintended pun.  
**[0:43:43-0:43:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:43:43):**  I think that the challenge there has to do with what is the grower actually valuing?  
**[0:43:49-0:43:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:43:49):**  They're valuing soil organic matter accumulation and nutrient availability in the soil based  
**[0:43:54-0:43:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:43:54):**  upon what the next crop and the rotation actually needs.  
**[0:43:59-0:44:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:43:59):**  So you're essentially creating the context for nutrient availability in the soil, say  
**[0:44:07-0:44:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:44:07):**  six months before the next crop actually needs access to those nutrients.  
**[0:44:11-0:44:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:44:11):**  And so the question is, well, what happens over the winter?  
**[0:44:15-0:44:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:44:15):**  Don't we lose anything?  
**[0:44:17-0:44:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:44:17):**  So we're monitoring what happens when you're growing, say, cover crops in the winter.  
**[0:44:24-0:44:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:44:24):**  And you're saying basically that the impact you've seen in these concrete examples of  
**[0:44:28-0:44:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:44:28):**  livestock as smartly part of a holistic rotation has been quite big and we need to have that  
**[0:44:35-0:44:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:44:35):**  discussion more often, how to integrate livestock.  
**[0:44:39-0:44:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:44:39):**  Yeah.  
**[0:44:40-0:44:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:44:40):**  So the next chapter in the discussion that's currently going on with the Regen ag community,  
**[0:44:44-0:44:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:44:44):**  where they're thinking about all of these things as separate things because they're  
**[0:44:48-0:44:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:44:48):**  just defining what is the term.  
**[0:44:50-0:44:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:44:50):**  So what do we get if we do cover crops?  
**[0:44:52-0:44:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:44:52):**  What happens if we do grazing?  
**[0:44:55-0:45:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:44:55):**  But they're looking at it in short time horizons and more as a point solution to say, what  
**[0:45:01-0:45:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:45:01):**  happens if I change this management practice as opposed to looking at the whole system?  
**[0:45:07-0:45:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:45:07):**  What are they trying to do across the rotation?  
**[0:45:10-0:45:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:45:10):**  And how do all these practices stack up in the context of it's a multivariate problem.  
**[0:45:16-0:45:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:45:16):**  So no one single regenerative agriculture practice will deliver all the benefits.  
**[0:45:22-0:45:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:45:22):**  And I think that's the challenge.  
**[0:45:24-0:45:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:45:24):**  And on the scientific side of this, our science team from Colorado State and the USDA having  
**[0:45:31-0:45:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:45:31):**  very long discussions about what is regenerative agriculture, why isn't the academic community  
**[0:45:38-0:45:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:45:38):**  picked this up and actually started to publish papers on this.  
**[0:45:40-0:45:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:45:40):**  So we have assembled a literature review of something like 150 papers that refer to all  
**[0:45:47-0:45:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:45:47):**  different aspects of these practices.  
**[0:45:49-0:45:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:45:49):**  But bringing that together in the context of what farmers do in a management tool is  
**[0:45:55-0:45:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:45:55):**  something that has been very slow to come to market.  
**[0:45:59-0:46:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:45:59):**  I think a lot of it has to do with if there's no demand for it, people aren't going to ask  
**[0:46:04-0:46:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:46:04):**  for something that they don't know they need.  
**[0:46:06-0:46:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:46:06):**  I think Steve Jobs said that, right?  
**[0:46:08-0:46:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:46:08):**  Or something.  
**[0:46:09-0:46:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:46:09):**  Yeah, something like that.  
**[0:46:10-0:46:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:46:10):**  But yeah, so I know that was your last question.  
**[0:46:12-0:46:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:46:12):**  Hopefully I've answered it.  
**[0:46:13-0:46:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:46:13):**  No, absolutely.  
**[0:46:14-0:46:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:46:14):**  I think it comes back to something you've mentioned before and actually something we've  
**[0:46:17-0:46:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:46:17):**  been discussing often in the podcast, that holistic view and that all systems approach  
**[0:46:22-0:46:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:46:22):**  that we need as it's such a complex system that we're dealing with and we're trying to  
**[0:46:27-0:46:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:46:27):**  simplify it a lot and that has had great benefits but also got us into a lot of trouble.  
**[0:46:33-0:46:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:46:33):**  So the steps back basically are going to be difficult because we don't know many of these  
**[0:46:37-0:46:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:46:37):**  things.  
**[0:46:38-0:46:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:46:38):**  We do know many of them but they're very siloed and connecting them both from the science  
**[0:46:41-0:46:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:46:41):**  part to the farmers part while running a system that keeps going every year and getting more  
**[0:46:46-0:46:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:46:46):**  extremes is just extremely complex but extremely interesting and exciting.  
**[0:46:51-0:46:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:46:51):**  So I want to thank you so much for your time and definitely I'll be checking in with you  
**[0:46:55-0:46:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:46:55):**  what the rest of this year brings and in the next years I think it's extremely exciting  
**[0:46:59-0:47:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:46:59):**  to have this conversation with someone who has been in this space for such a while.

**[0:48:05-0:48:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:48:05):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[0:48:06-0:48:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:48:06):**  After 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question how to put money  
**[0:48:11-0:48:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:48:11):**  to work in regenerating soils and have been following this space since 2011 and recording

**[0:49:00-0:49:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:49:00):**  And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office  
**[0:49:03-0:49:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:49:03):**  or as private individuals or people who are putting other people's money to work through

**[0:49:14-0:49:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:49:14):**  No.  
**[0:49:15-0:49:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:49:15):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:49:17-0:49:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:49:17):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.  
**[0:49:21-0:49:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:49:21):**  And I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very  
**[0:49:26-0:49:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:49:26):**  different means.  
**[0:49:27-0:49:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:49:27):**  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you, and if you have the means to  
**[0:49:32-0:49:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:49:32):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[0:49:35-0:49:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:49:35):**  Thank you.  
**[0:49:36-0:49:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:49:36):**  So what is this course?  
**[0:49:37-0:49:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:49:37):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  
**[0:49:43-0:49:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:49:43):**  so you don't have to write along.  
**[0:49:45-0:49:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:49:45):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:49:50-0:49:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:49:50):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:49:56-0:50:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:49:56):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find, or what kind of investors you could  
**[0:50:00-0:50:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:50:00):**  find if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:50:02-0:50:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:50:02):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:50:07-0:50:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:50:07):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:50:11-0:50:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:50:11):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design, and a lot more.  
**[0:50:15-0:50:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:50:15):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:50:16-0:50:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:50:16):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:50:19-0:50:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:50:19):**  Unfortunately, that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:50:21-0:50:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:50:21):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:50:24-0:50:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:50:24):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:50:27-0:50:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:50:27):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.  
**[0:50:32-0:50:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/20/stephanie-race/#t=0:50:32):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea, or whatever you're drinking.

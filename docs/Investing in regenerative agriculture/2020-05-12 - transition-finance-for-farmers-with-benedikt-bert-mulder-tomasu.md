**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:00:14):**  In this episode, we discuss what the role is of fully vertically integrated products  
**[0:00:18-0:00:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:00:18):**  in the regenerative transition of a farmer.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:00:21):**  Products that really go from soil to plate and discover the story of the only micro soy  
**[0:00:26-0:00:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:00:26):**  sauce brewery in Europe.  
**[0:00:39-0:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:00:39):**  Welcome to investing in regenerative agriculture and food.  
**[0:00:42-0:00:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:00:42):**  This is a special dedicated series on transition finance.  
**[0:00:46-0:00:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:00:46):**  Why are we recording this series?  
**[0:00:48-0:00:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:00:48):**  Many farmers are ready to speed up their regenerative transition.  
**[0:00:51-0:00:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:00:51):**  They've looked for learning, done the courses, read the key books, hosted the gurus on their  
**[0:00:56-0:01:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:00:56):**  farms, explored farm size regenerative designs, and most importantly, started their pilots  
**[0:01:00-0:01:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:01:00):**  and feedback loops.  
**[0:01:02-0:01:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:01:02):**  This is where transition finance is key.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:01:05):**  A local bank loan often isn't feasible because of the short duration, lack of flexibility,  
**[0:01:10-0:01:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:01:10):**  and the farmer's lack of collateral.  
**[0:01:12-0:01:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:01:12):**  Furthermore, there's a limit of how much equity a farmer is able or willing to give away.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:01:18):**  That is why my co-host aspiring to be regenerative farmer, Benedict Boesel, and I are embarking  
**[0:01:23-0:01:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:01:23):**  on a journey to find out what are the key principles of transition finance for regenerative  
**[0:01:29-0:01:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:01:29):**  farmers.  
**[0:01:30-0:01:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:01:30):**  We are interviewing leading practitioners in the regenerative agriculture and food finance  
**[0:01:35-0:01:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:01:35):**  space.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:01:36):**  They shared our insights, how they would finance the speed up of the regenerative transition  
**[0:01:40-0:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:01:40):**  on Benedict's 1000 hectares, which is almost two and a half thousand acres farm in Germany  
**[0:01:45-0:01:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:01:45):**  close to Berlin.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:01:47):**  This is an open process.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:01:48):**  We are sharing our lessons through the podcast episodes as we go along.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:01:52):**  We don't have the answers yet.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:01:53):**  Just a lot of questions.  
**[0:01:54-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:01:54):**  So please share with us any examples of transition finance you've seen, other inspiration, people  
**[0:02:00-0:02:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:02:00):**  to interview, et cetera.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:02:01):**  Get in touch via the contact page on the website, investinginregenerativeagriculture.com.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:02:06):**  That is investinginregenerativeagriculture.com.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:02:12):**  Tomazu soy sauce is the only micro-brewed soy sauce in Europe and finds its origin in  
**[0:02:16-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:02:16):**  Rotterdam, the Netherlands.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:02:18):**  And I'm pretty sure they're the only farm to bottle and farm to plate soy sauce maker  
**[0:02:22-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:02:22):**  in the world with a regenerative farmer as part of the company.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:02:25):**  Welcome Bert.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:02:26):**  Hey, cool.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:02:27):**  Thanks for having us.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:02:28):**  Of course, of course.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:02:29):**  And a personal question, because you don't have a background as a farmer, if I remember  
**[0:02:33-0:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:02:33):**  correctly, how did you end up talking about soy and soil so much and what brings you to  
**[0:02:39-0:02:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:02:39):**  the world of agriculture?  
**[0:02:40-0:02:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:02:40):**  Well, I'm still kind of surprised that I'm talking about soil.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:02:43):**  If you would have asked me this question five years ago, I would, I would never have known  
**[0:02:47-0:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:02:47):**  that I was about to talk about soil, to be honest.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:02:50):**  So it has been quite a five year journey that is now resulting in this podcast.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:02:58):**  And can you share a bit about your background as you don't come from, I think, the food  
**[0:03:01-0:03:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:03:01):**  space and the agriculture space?  
**[0:03:03-0:03:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:03:03):**  Well, my personal background finds its origin in more marketing and commercial related roles.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:03:08):**  But to be honest, this whole soy sauce story started with my brother-in-law, which I know  
**[0:03:13-0:03:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:03:13):**  already for 15 or 16 years or so, who has a long history with his family as a baker.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:03:19):**  So when he visited my home, I think it was six, seven years ago and asked me what I thought  
**[0:03:26-0:03:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:03:26):**  about the idea of brewing our own soy sauce.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:03:28):**  I thought he was lunatic, to be honest.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:03:30):**  But that same evening I started Googling and I was like, why is nobody doing this?  
**[0:03:35-0:03:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:03:35):**  It is like the number one most used sauce in the world, obviously for Asian reasons.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:03:40):**  But it's not like what you have with vinegar or a balsamico or with olive oil that you  
**[0:03:47-0:03:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:03:47):**  have meters and meters wide in stores.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:03:50):**  And with soy sauce, there are just one, two options you can have whilst the flavor it  
**[0:03:55-0:03:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:03:55):**  brings to your dish is insane.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:03:58):**  And so looking into it, it was like, why is nobody doing this?  
**[0:04:02-0:04:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:04:02):**  So from that moment on, that first evening, we were like, okay, if we're going to do this,  
**[0:04:07-0:04:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:04:07):**  we need to do this properly.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:04:09):**  And then we need to be very careful with what we have in our hands.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:04:13):**  Still very doubtful, very insecure whether this was even a good idea.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:04:17):**  But we simply started and that's where the journey started.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:04:19):**  So okay, how do you make it?  
**[0:04:22-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:04:22):**  And luckily we got some help from America.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:04:23):**  Yeah, because with the power of the internet, obviously you found some examples of actually  
**[0:04:27-0:04:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:04:27):**  people that have done it at a non-industrial scale.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:04:30):**  Yeah, that's quite a cool story.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:04:32):**  Because as I said, my brother-in-law was two months before I think he visited me and sat  
**[0:04:37-0:04:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:04:37):**  down at my kitchen table.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:04:38):**  He was looking at this corporate channel and was watching a documentary called Bizarre  
**[0:04:42-0:04:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:04:42):**  Foods where a blonde haired, blue eyed guy from Louisville, Kentucky was brewing his  
**[0:04:48-0:04:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:04:48):**  own soy sauce.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:04:50):**  And it is a bizarre food having that context.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:04:53):**  And at that moment, watching the documentary, he literally booked a flight ticket and within  
**[0:04:57-0:05:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:04:57):**  two days he was visiting his brewery and he knocked on the door without an invitation.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:05:02):**  And luckily the guy opened the door and he said the famous words, well, where are you  
**[0:05:06-0:05:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:05:06):**  from?  
**[0:05:07-0:05:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:05:07):**  Do we have an appointment?  
**[0:05:08-0:05:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:05:08):**  No, no, no.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:05:09):**  I'm from television and what you are doing, I want to do in the Netherlands.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:05:13):**  And he was like, okay, welcome in Kentucky.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:05:16):**  And that's basically the start of it all.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:05:18):**  And he came back, was infused with the whole soy sauce virus and infused me and infused  
**[0:05:23-0:05:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:05:23):**  his right hand in his bakery.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:05:26):**  And suddenly we were with the three of us willing to start the soy sauce journey basically.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:05:31):**  But very soon we already discovered that, okay, if we're going to do this, we need to  
**[0:05:35-0:05:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:05:35):**  do this properly.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:05:36):**  And we got really inspired by wineries where soil is an actual part of the whole product  
**[0:05:42-0:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:05:42):**  philosophy.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:05:43):**  And not that it was on purpose that we were already looking into soil or whatever, it  
**[0:05:48-0:05:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:05:48):**  was more driven from a need for autonomy.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:05:52):**  We want to do everything ourselves because from the start we had the idea this might  
**[0:05:56-0:05:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:05:56):**  be something special.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:05:57):**  So we need to be very careful with what we have and let's find a farmer.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:06:02):**  And that was quite a journey, to be honest, quite a quest to find the one that was suiting  
**[0:06:07-0:06:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:06:07):**  our vision and matched our values.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:06:10):**  I think that's something, first of all, I got goosebumps when you told that story because  
**[0:06:15-0:06:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:06:15):**  it resonates with so much experience that I have had and that I am always kind of having  
**[0:06:20-0:06:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:06:20):**  for some reason.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:06:22):**  And I think the basis and the key, and that's, I think for all of us in any situation, it's  
**[0:06:27-0:06:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:06:27):**  this believing and understanding and just doing it, just starting.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:06:32):**  That's everything.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:06:33):**  Everything is starting and doing it because once you do that, once you start the journey,  
**[0:06:38-0:06:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:06:38):**  so to say, and it reflects beautifully with the story how your brother-in-law went to  
**[0:06:42-0:06:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:06:42):**  the US and then obviously this guy opens the door and everything falls into place as if  
**[0:06:46-0:06:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:06:46):**  there is some sort of laid out plan that was always lying there and you guys basically  
**[0:06:50-0:06:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:06:50):**  just go with it.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:06:51):**  And then it's a journey and that's what it's all about.  
**[0:06:55-0:06:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:06:55):**  And this is what brings the passion in it.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:06:58):**  This brings the motivation, the vision, the idea, the energy that you can basically get  
**[0:07:03-0:07:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:07:03):**  out of it.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:07:04):**  And I think this is really key for all of those transition processes and those who are  
**[0:07:09-0:07:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:07:09):**  wanting to try new ways and go different directions because life has a funny way of then actually  
**[0:07:16-0:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:07:16):**  bringing things to you and opening doors and establishing connections with people or with  
**[0:07:21-0:07:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:07:21):**  situations that you wouldn't have thought before.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:07:24):**  So I think that's just a beautiful story.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:07:26):**  Thank you so much for sharing that.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:07:27):**  The thing is all credit should go to him, but it turned out to become a red thread in  
**[0:07:32-0:07:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:07:32):**  our whole company basically.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:07:33):**  So we don't have all the answers to be honest, but we do have all the questions and in order  
**[0:07:39-0:07:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:07:39):**  to get those answers, you simply need to do stuff.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:07:42):**  And it's about trial and error.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:07:43):**  We did a lot of stupid things along the way.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:07:46):**  We lost a lot of money, lost a lot of time, but we had fun doing it and we got out better  
**[0:07:50-0:07:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:07:50):**  than we started.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:07:51):**  So that became some sort of a life motto or however you want to call it for our company,  
**[0:07:57-0:07:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:07:57):**  for small group of people basically.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:07:59):**  And we left the story at this.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:08:01):**  You pretty quickly found out that you wanted to keep everything in your own hands.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:08:07):**  Basically could be completely vertically integrated.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:08:10):**  That means you needed a farmer that farmed soy.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:08:12):**  Was that difficult, easy?  
**[0:08:15-0:08:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:08:15):**  Because I'm pretty sure there are some interesting stories also on that side on how you found  
**[0:08:19-0:08:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:08:19):**  a regenerative farmer at the end, because you mentioned you weren't too focused on soil.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:08:22):**  You were focused on quality.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:08:24):**  How did that happen to find your key ingredients for the source?  
**[0:08:28-0:08:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:08:28):**  Had to do a lot with luck, I think in a sense.  
**[0:08:31-0:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:08:31):**  But for us, it all started with that search for autonomy.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:08:34):**  We want to do everything ourselves.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:08:36):**  So we needed a farmer, but actually that was the basis for starting the search for a farmer.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:08:42):**  But it actually in the end turned out to be one of our most crucial decisions that we've  
**[0:08:46-0:08:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:08:46):**  made because for us it's all about some sort of a relentless search for flavor, if you  
**[0:08:51-0:08:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:08:51):**  call it like that.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:08:53):**  And we never expected the farmer to play such a crucial role in that process.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:08:59):**  And because if you see what happens now, and that is like, let's say five years later,  
**[0:09:04-0:09:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:09:04):**  we see that chefs who are visiting our brewery, we can now also bring them to the farm.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:09:09):**  And it sounds also obvious, but apparently it's not.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:09:13):**  It's not obvious, it's also not obvious that there's a soy sauce brewery in Rotterdam,  
**[0:09:19-0:09:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:09:19):**  apparently.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:09:20):**  But from the brewery to the farm is like a 10 minute drive.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:09:24):**  And it's so honest in a sense that you can be very vulnerable because at least we're  
**[0:09:29-0:09:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:09:29):**  trying, we know what you're doing.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:09:31):**  And the fact that you have a farm, have your own brewery, have everything under control,  
**[0:09:36-0:09:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:09:36):**  it allows you to be vulnerable.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:09:38):**  And as I said, we don't have all the answers, but we certainly do have all the questions.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:09:42):**  And what we did create is the luxury position that we can look for the answers in our own  
**[0:09:48-0:09:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:09:48):**  supply chain.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:09:50):**  And that turned out to be one of our most crucial decisions that we've made.  
**[0:09:53-0:09:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:09:53):**  But the search for a farmer was rather difficult and even frustrating at times.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:09:58):**  Obviously, I'm going to ask, why is that?  
**[0:10:00-0:10:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:10:00):**  Can you elaborate a bit?  
**[0:10:01-0:10:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:10:01):**  Yeah, the frustration was that the question we had where we started to look for farmers,  
**[0:10:06-0:10:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:10:06):**  our main question was, can you grow for quality instead of quantity?  
**[0:10:11-0:10:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:10:11):**  And although that seems like a very positive question to a farmer, it didn't resonate.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:10:17):**  It was like, yeah, they're so programmed in a sense to focus on quantity that the whole  
**[0:10:22-0:10:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:10:22):**  quality aspect was not even part of the conversation.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:10:26):**  So we got kind of frustrated about it because, hey, we're offering you something.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:10:32):**  It's let's set a fixed fee for your hectare as long as you promise us that you do the  
**[0:10:37-0:10:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:10:37):**  best you can instead of grow the most you can.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:10:41):**  And after hearing no several times, we were like, are we stupid?  
**[0:10:44-0:10:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:10:44):**  What is going on here?  
**[0:10:45-0:10:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:10:45):**  And I remember a moment.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:10:47):**  It was again, my brother-in-law, Thomas is his name.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:10:50):**  He was visiting some sort of a conference, small conference with a miller in the south  
**[0:10:55-0:10:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:10:55):**  of the Netherlands.  
**[0:10:56-0:11:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:10:56):**  And he got tapped on the back and hey, maybe it's better if you stop this conversation  
**[0:11:01-0:11:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:11:01):**  because he, again, it was kind of ending up being a frustrating conversation.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:11:05):**  And he was like, you should call this guy.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:11:07):**  He talks as strange as YouTube.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:11:09):**  And that was Jeroen, our farmer who is now onboarding our company.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:11:12):**  And basically he got his phone number, called him and we visited his farm.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:11:16):**  And I think within 30 to 45 minutes, this was a done deal in a sense that, okay, we're  
**[0:11:21-0:11:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:11:21):**  going to do this together.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:11:22):**  And that's how it started with the farm.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:11:24):**  And obviously that had also a lot of hiccups in the beginning because he was talking always  
**[0:11:29-0:11:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:11:29):**  big quantities and we were about small tests.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:11:32):**  But over the years we found each other better.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:11:34):**  And did Jeroen the farmer already grow soy?  
**[0:11:37-0:11:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:11:37):**  It's a very practical question.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:11:39):**  But I was just wondering because it's not so known, I think in at least south of Rotterdam  
**[0:11:45-0:11:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:11:45):**  as a soy growing area.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:11:46):**  No, I think it wasn't part of his rotation yet, but he was looking into it and he was  
**[0:11:52-0:11:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:11:52):**  growing greens already, kidney beans, brown beans whatsoever.  
**[0:11:56-0:11:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:11:56):**  And for us, it was together with Jeroen.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:11:58):**  That's also why it was very helpful to have a farmer on board.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:12:00):**  It was like, okay, we have this type of soil because we are located south of Rotterdam.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:12:07):**  What is the best soybean for this type of soil in this type of climate and for this  
**[0:12:12-0:12:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:12:12):**  type of product?  
**[0:12:14-0:12:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:12:14):**  And obviously we didn't have the answers.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:12:16):**  So we went to the University of Wageningen and we found out that there are over 5,000  
**[0:12:20-0:12:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:12:20):**  species of soybeans.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:12:22):**  And together with the professor and the university, we made a pre-selection.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:12:26):**  We narrowed it down to, let's say 24 species, did some small test fields in, I think it  
**[0:12:32-0:12:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:12:32):**  was somewhere in the middle of the Netherlands.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:12:34):**  And we selected four based upon nutritional value, based upon looks, to be honest, some  
**[0:12:39-0:12:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:12:39):**  plants simply look better.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:12:41):**  We actually had a conversation about our ingredients instead of buying it on the market.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:12:47):**  And the fact that we had those conversations is already, has so much value for our product  
**[0:12:53-0:12:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:12:53):**  in understanding what we are doing and what we were about to do.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:12:56):**  And also having a farmer on board, being part of that process, asking different questions  
**[0:13:01-0:13:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:13:01):**  that really helped us.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:13:03):**  And I think it's now slightly more common to grow soybeans in the Netherlands as a rotational  
**[0:13:08-0:13:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:13:08):**  crop, but for us it's our main ingredient.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:13:10):**  So that has a lot of benefits also for the farm.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:13:13):**  I was just wondering basically how do these varieties that you do choose, which are quality  
**[0:13:19-0:13:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:13:19):**  wise good from nutritional value, which have a nice taste, how do they compare on average  
**[0:13:24-0:13:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:13:24):**  to the average soybean that is irregular being used for people that are actually looking  
**[0:13:30-0:13:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:13:30):**  for yield?  
**[0:13:31-0:13:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:13:31):**  Like the difference between the two, do you know what I mean?  
**[0:13:34-0:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:13:34):**  I think the biggest difference, to be honest, eventually comes to the quality of the soil.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:13:39):**  So the selection of the variety of the soybeans, I'm not so aware of what the differences are,  
**[0:13:44-0:13:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:13:44):**  to be honest.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:13:46):**  But what we see, and that's also data we are getting over the years, so we are getting  
**[0:13:51-0:13:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:13:51):**  a better insight in what the nutritional value of our own soybeans are.  
**[0:13:55-0:14:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:13:55):**  We only have now four harvests, so it's not that much of data to say something.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:14:00):**  But for us, what we see is that we see a clear relationship between the quality of the soil  
**[0:14:06-0:14:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:14:06):**  and the nutritional value in the soybean.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:14:09):**  And for us, there's a saying we tend to use a lot, is that nutritional value is no matter  
**[0:14:15-0:14:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:14:15):**  how you look at it, connected to taste and in a positive way.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:14:19):**  So the higher the nutritional value, we genuinely believe that it has a positive impact on taste.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:14:25):**  So the way we look at it, it's our own soil, it's our own variety, and we try to treat  
**[0:14:31-0:14:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:14:31):**  our soil the best we can every year in order to ramp up the nutritional value of the soybeans.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:14:37):**  So I don't have a lot of insight in comparison to other soy farmers or other varieties, to  
**[0:14:43-0:14:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:14:43):**  be honest.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:14:44):**  Yeah, this is hugely interesting.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:14:46):**  Obviously we know, I guess we all know Zach Bush and his work in the US and sort of bringing  
**[0:14:51-0:14:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:14:51):**  that, I think that impact and that narrative of soil quality, nutritional value, taste  
**[0:14:58-0:14:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:14:58):**  towards the consumer.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:14:59):**  I think that's a great way of actually starting a conversation that front.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:15:03):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:15:04):**  And Dan Barber, obviously.  
**[0:15:05-0:15:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:15:05):**  Exactly.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:15:06):**  But just one thing going back, because I mean, a farmer will always ask for the financials,  
**[0:15:10-0:15:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:15:10):**  right?  
**[0:15:11-0:15:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:15:11):**  Like, on an acre or whatever, is there a margin increase that you're offering Jerome for his  
**[0:15:15-0:15:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:15:15):**  work and also his caretaking maybe for the soil that actually reflects basically in the  
**[0:15:21-0:15:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:15:21):**  margin that you offer him?  
**[0:15:22-0:15:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:15:22):**  Or is it not really about that?  
**[0:15:24-0:15:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:15:24):**  Is it also other factors?  
**[0:15:25-0:15:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:15:25):**  Well, we have a couple of things that we strive for.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:15:28):**  I'm not saying that we are already successful with all of them, but what you're striving  
**[0:15:32-0:15:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:15:32):**  for is that we are paying for quality and not quantity asset.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:15:36):**  So meaning that he doesn't need to focus on yield or quantity wise, he needs to focus  
**[0:15:41-0:15:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:15:41):**  on quality.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:15:42):**  And that could result in a situation where we give him a guaranteed fee per hectare.  
**[0:15:48-0:15:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:15:48):**  And that fee, he's part of the conversation, which for him is already, he's part of the  
**[0:15:54-0:15:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:15:54):**  company that is buying his soybeans.  
**[0:15:57-0:15:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:15:57):**  So there's an equal conversation.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:15:59):**  He's sitting at both tables.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:16:00):**  So that already gives him the flexibility to see, okay, for this year with this level  
**[0:16:06-0:16:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:16:06):**  of quality in the context that we are with both companies, this is a proper price to  
**[0:16:11-0:16:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:16:11):**  pay.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:16:12):**  And thus far we didn't face any situations as we didn't manage to figure it out with  
**[0:16:17-0:16:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:16:17):**  the four of us.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:16:18):**  And so the main focus is to manage the risk and to spread the risk in the whole vertical  
**[0:16:24-0:16:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:16:24):**  chain and comparing it to the more conventional way of doing business for a farmer is that  
**[0:16:30-0:16:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:16:30):**  all the risk is at his end and spreading that risk already gives a lot of comfort on his  
**[0:16:35-0:16:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:16:35):**  side in a sense that that will allow him to not to compromise on flower edges, not to  
**[0:16:42-0:16:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:16:42):**  compromise on cover crops, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:16:45):**  Because usually that tends to become a financial decision.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:16:49):**  And that's what we want to get out of the process.  
**[0:16:51-0:16:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:16:51):**  We don't want to make decisions based on financial components because yeah, that would mean that  
**[0:16:58-0:17:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:16:58):**  we are losing sight of the quality of our product.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:17:01):**  And with the margins we have on soy sauce, there's some room to pay more than what he  
**[0:17:06-0:17:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:17:06):**  would get on the regular market.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:17:08):**  What would that mean for you Benedict?  
**[0:17:09-0:17:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:17:09):**  A guaranteed payment per hectare, not per yield.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:17:12):**  Just dreaming about it, thinking about it, would that be fundamental in shifting possibilities?  
**[0:17:18-0:17:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:17:18):**  Would that be a small change?  
**[0:17:20-0:17:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:17:20):**  Taking risk of my shoulders would be an amazing step, obviously, right?  
**[0:17:26-0:17:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:17:26):**  Because the thing is, Focke-Engelsmann always says, how can I think green if my figures  
**[0:17:30-0:17:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:17:30):**  are red?  
**[0:17:32-0:17:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:17:32):**  And I think that sentence has just stuck with me because I can feel that from my heart.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:17:39):**  Most of the decisions today are only financial because we are all kind of, and I'm stuck  
**[0:17:44-0:17:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:17:44):**  in my system with the way we do it on the farm.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:17:47):**  I cannot change too many of the large variables, although even if I wanted to, because there's  
**[0:17:53-0:17:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:17:53):**  just too much risk.  
**[0:17:54-0:17:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:17:54):**  You have to earn a certain cashflow in order to be able to pay the cost that you have.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:17:58):**  And if you can't pay them, you can't start doing things that you might want to do, but  
**[0:18:02-0:18:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:18:02):**  come at a certain cost.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:18:03):**  So being able to take decisions that are not solely based on the financial side would basically  
**[0:18:10-0:18:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:18:10):**  give you the freedom to operate in a way that has maybe a strong focus on ecological side  
**[0:18:15-0:18:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:18:15):**  effects, has a stronger focus on actually going ways that you know that will pay off  
**[0:18:21-0:18:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:18:21):**  in the future.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:18:22):**  But those first couple of years, I guess, or transition years would then be eased through,  
**[0:18:28-0:18:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:18:28):**  I guess.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:18:29):**  So having a certain fixed income per hectare on a certain area of the farm, that obviously  
**[0:18:34-0:18:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:18:34):**  helps you a lot because you can work with it, you can plan with it, and it's there for  
**[0:18:38-0:18:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:18:38):**  you to basically use in order to steer the company in a direction where you want it to  
**[0:18:43-0:18:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:18:43):**  be.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:18:44):**  So I think that's a great way of doing it.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:18:46):**  And especially that combination with having a company that is actually using that product  
**[0:18:49-0:18:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:18:49):**  also like Jerome is involved and that way of discussing together the price, the quantities,  
**[0:18:56-0:18:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:18:56):**  the way, the strategy.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:18:57):**  I think that is a model that is an incredible model, to be honest with you.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:19:02):**  I think we should understand agriculture much more in that regard, that it's not only the  
**[0:19:07-0:19:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:19:07):**  production of resources or food and feed.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:19:11):**  It's so much more.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:19:12):**  You can do so much more.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:19:13):**  And why shouldn't you?  
**[0:19:15-0:19:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:19:15):**  To follow up on that, I think it's also not that at the muscle we are, let's say,  
**[0:19:19-0:19:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:19:19):**  activists who simply think farmers should get paid more.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:19:22):**  It actually brings us a lot of added value.  
**[0:19:25-0:19:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:19:25):**  So ever since we started, we never spent one euro marketing, but we drove to the farm,  
**[0:19:30-0:19:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:19:30):**  I think 100, maybe 200, 300 times.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:19:33):**  And the value of having conversations in between your own soybeans, if you wanted to express  
**[0:19:40-0:19:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:19:40):**  that in marketing value, that is insane.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:19:42):**  So it's not that we are supporting farmers or whatsoever.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:19:45):**  No, it's actually adding value to our business.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:19:48):**  So by having the opportunity to bring people to the field, explaining our philosophy on  
**[0:19:54-0:20:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:19:54):**  soil on how we treat our crops, all these things, it's not charity at all.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:20:01):**  It's for us a crucial, maybe even a decisive decision that we made for how we are perceived  
**[0:20:06-0:20:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:20:06):**  as a brand and as a product.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:20:08):**  And how is it, you mentioned four harvests, like this work and the work you've been doing  
**[0:20:12-0:20:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:20:12):**  with the farm, obviously inside the company and the farmer relationship.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:20:16):**  Has it changed the quality, like the measurements you've been doing, you mentioned it before,  
**[0:20:20-0:20:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:20:20):**  has it changed the soy over the last four years?  
**[0:20:22-0:20:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:20:22):**  Like, have you seen an increase or an improvement?  
**[0:20:26-0:20:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:20:26):**  Flavour obviously is something you're constantly seeking for.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:20:29):**  What has been the differences over the last four years as the farmer has been focusing  
**[0:20:33-0:20:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:20:33):**  more and more and more on soil?  
**[0:20:34-0:20:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:20:34):**  To be honest, we do single cask.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:20:36):**  So we brew our soy sauce on 30 to 40 year old whiskey barrels we source from Scotland.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:20:42):**  So every barrel in itself already has a unique flavour.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:20:46):**  It requires a pretty professional taste buds to notice the difference, to be honest, but  
**[0:20:51-0:20:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:20:51):**  there is a difference in it.  
**[0:20:53-0:20:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:20:53):**  For us, it's hard to say.  
**[0:20:55-0:20:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:20:55):**  It depends a lot on the weather.  
**[0:20:57-0:20:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:20:57):**  It depends on the barrel it's in.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:20:59):**  It depends on the parcels that we've used.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:21:02):**  It depends on the time of the year that we start the process of brewing.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:21:05):**  All these elements come into play.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:21:07):**  So it's, I find it hard to say, well, that harvest was better than that harvest.  
**[0:21:11-0:21:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:21:11):**  With wine, for instance, it's, I think better to compare because yeah, it's all grapes.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:21:17):**  There's a wine of that year.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:21:18):**  There's a wine of that year.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:21:19):**  We have a lot of other.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:21:20):**  It's a perennial crop.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:21:21):**  It stays in the same place.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:21:23):**  Exactly.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:21:24):**  Yeah.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:21:25):**  Maybe that's the most important part.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:21:26):**  But for us, it's, there are so many variables that have influence on the flavour that for  
**[0:21:30-0:21:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:21:30):**  me it's hard to see a difference.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:21:33):**  So the way we use our different harvests is that we look at the nutritional value.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:21:39):**  We look at how it responds in the initial week of creating Koji.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:21:43):**  That's the first step of making soy sauce.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:21:45):**  And when it turns into Moromi, when it goes into the barrel, then we see what happens.  
**[0:21:51-0:21:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:21:51):**  But we don't have all knowledge yet.  
**[0:21:53-0:21:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:21:53):**  So what we created is a situation that we hope that within 10, 15, maybe even 20 years  
**[0:21:59-0:22:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:21:59):**  from now, I can give you an answer to the question you just asked, but now I don't.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:22:03):**  Let's say also the wine industry had a few years to figure out a lot of these things.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:22:08):**  The cool thing also is it's not that we have a whole list of contacts that we can call  
**[0:22:12-0:22:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:22:12):**  and say, how do you do this?  
**[0:22:15-0:22:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:22:15):**  Because we got in contact with Japanese soy brewers and obviously the American soy brewer.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:22:19):**  And it's not that they are approaching it like this and they are now also raising questions  
**[0:22:24-0:22:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:22:24):**  within their supply chain.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:22:26):**  But for us, there are not a lot of beers to discuss this.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:22:30):**  Meaning that you're the only one, I mean, I suggested that in my intro, but it was mostly  
**[0:22:34-0:22:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:22:34):**  me suggesting it.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:22:35):**  You're probably the only or one of the very few soy brewers that have access to their  
**[0:22:40-0:22:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:22:40):**  own soy and actually are in full control over the full value chain, basically a full value  
**[0:22:46-0:22:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:22:46):**  web of their product.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:22:47):**  Yeah, I know that the guy who welcomed us six years ago, Matt Jamie from bourbon barrel  
**[0:22:52-0:22:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:22:52):**  foods in Louisville, Kentucky is also having very close relationship with his suppliers.  
**[0:22:57-0:23:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:22:57):**  So I know he's doing it as well.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:23:00):**  But to be honest, from the people we spoke to in Japan, it was, we never met any soy  
**[0:23:04-0:23:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:23:04):**  brewers from Korea or whatsoever, but yeah, they were very surprised hearing our story.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:23:10):**  That's insane if you ask me, but it is what it is.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:23:13):**  Yeah, no, of course.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:23:15):**  And what would be some tips or how would you approach this with the knowledge you have?  
**[0:23:20-0:23:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:23:20):**  Obviously you say we have more questions than answers.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:23:22):**  That's more or less the motto of this podcast as well, but what would be some questions  
**[0:23:26-0:23:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:23:26):**  you would ask any farmer in that is, I mean, like we usually say at the intro, it's farmers  
**[0:23:32-0:23:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:23:32):**  that are too big for the farmer's market and are probably still part of a large part of  
**[0:23:36-0:23:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:23:36):**  the commodity markets that are wanting to shift some pieces of the farm, some experiments,  
**[0:23:41-0:23:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:23:41):**  some early trials to see and to taste what could happen with different margins, guaranteed  
**[0:23:45-0:23:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:23:45):**  prices, quality over quantity, et cetera.  
**[0:23:48-0:23:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:23:48):**  What would be your first step as in this case, soy sauce maker?  
**[0:23:52-0:23:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:23:52):**  Well, for me is what we are very happy with now looking back is that we are a company  
**[0:23:59-0:24:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:23:59):**  or a group of four people and we have a farmer, we have a former baker who now turned into  
**[0:24:04-0:24:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:24:04):**  a soy brewer, let's say, and we have me responsible for, let's say, visualizing the product, sharing  
**[0:24:10-0:24:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:24:10):**  the story, the marketing, more commercial part.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:24:13):**  And then you have my brother-in-law who is bothering everybody with his opinion, et cetera,  
**[0:24:17-0:24:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:24:17):**  et cetera.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:24:18):**  So he's a junior farmer, junior brewer and junior marketeer basically, or senior, whatever  
**[0:24:23-0:24:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:24:23):**  you want to call it.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:24:24):**  But the thing is that we are not competitors.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:24:27):**  So I trust the farmer in his profession.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:24:29):**  I trust the brewer in his profession.  
**[0:24:31-0:24:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:24:31):**  They trust me in my profession.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:24:33):**  And the cool thing about it is that I'm not insulted by odd or even stupid questions or  
**[0:24:40-0:24:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:24:40):**  critical questions at all.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:24:42):**  And everybody looks at it from their angle and that creates a certain synergy between  
**[0:24:47-0:24:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:24:47):**  the each part of the chain that allows us to be very good in what we do as individuals.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:24:53):**  And some of it is something that really works.  
**[0:24:56-0:25:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:24:56):**  So we also don't have daily contact with each other.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:25:00):**  Everybody's doing his own thing.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:25:01):**  And on a weekly basis, there's a quick catch up basically, and we're going full steam ahead.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:25:07):**  And if you want to do this, you need to have all disciplines in place because if you need  
**[0:25:12-0:25:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:25:12):**  to do this all by yourself, it's going to be a nightmare to be honest.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:25:16):**  And so that's one thing.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:25:17):**  And the second thing is simply try a lot, do a lot and see where you end up.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:25:23):**  And because the biggest asset we have is our knowledge and the knowledge about our product.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:25:29):**  So by raising a lot of questions and trying and testing and doing stupid stuff, we are  
**[0:25:34-0:25:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:25:34):**  now just got a text from Jeroen that he's testing rice.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:25:39):**  And we don't know where we're going to use it for, but it turns out to be a good crop  
**[0:25:43-0:25:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:25:43):**  in the rotation for whatever kind of other crop.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:25:46):**  And okay, we're trying and maybe it raises a lot of more questions, but it will certainly  
**[0:25:52-0:25:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:25:52):**  also give a lot of answers.  
**[0:25:53-0:25:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:25:53):**  And that's also the joy of it that we keep on experimenting.  
**[0:25:57-0:26:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:25:57):**  And to be able to do so, you need to have that first group of people with different  
**[0:26:02-0:26:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:26:02):**  backgrounds.  
**[0:26:03-0:26:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:26:03):**  I was just wondering to find those four people.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:26:07):**  This is basically what makes the sauce.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:26:10):**  I mean, it's an incredible journey to find the right people to do this with.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:26:14):**  In my experience, it takes quite a long time to get to know people on a level that you  
**[0:26:18-0:26:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:26:18):**  do know if they are the right people.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:26:21):**  So maybe you were lucky or maybe it was an interesting coincidence, but I'd be interested  
**[0:26:27-0:26:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:26:27):**  to hear maybe some of your personal story as well, that if this is so to say one of  
**[0:26:32-0:26:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:26:32):**  many and this one worked, or have you got an opinion on that?  
**[0:26:36-0:26:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:26:36):**  Because for me as a farmer, I mean, this is a model that we do.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:26:40):**  We lease land to a couple that is doing a market garden.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:26:43):**  We work with different corporates here on the estate.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:26:46):**  We have always between five and 10 interns.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:26:49):**  We have people around all the time and I'm very...  
**[0:26:51-0:26:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:26:51):**  Well, I try to be obviously including, but I mean, I do look at the people or I try to  
**[0:26:57-0:27:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:26:57):**  look at the people very carefully because if you have so many people, especially if  
**[0:27:00-0:27:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:27:00):**  they're young and there's many things happening, then it's important to find the right people.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:27:05):**  And so I think that's such a crucial point.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:27:08):**  So if you have some more to share how you actually found them and which experience maybe  
**[0:27:13-0:27:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:27:13):**  you made as well, maybe there's even a line of communication between the four of you,  
**[0:27:17-0:27:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:27:17):**  I think that would be really interesting to know as well.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:27:19):**  Well, also there was a lot of luck in play that we knew some people already, but looking  
**[0:27:25-0:27:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:27:25):**  back at it, I think it was for all of us, it feels very logical that we are now where  
**[0:27:31-0:27:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:27:31):**  we are, but it was never planned.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:27:33):**  But we have two sides of the story.  
**[0:27:35-0:27:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:27:35):**  One was the lucky part where I turned out to be a brother-in-law who was making his  
**[0:27:41-0:27:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:27:41):**  profession in more marketing commercial related area.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:27:44):**  So that was something my brother-in-law didn't have.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:27:47):**  So that was a good mix.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:27:48):**  That was just luck.  
**[0:27:49-0:27:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:27:49):**  He had a baker who turned out to be very creative and willing to dive deep into the world of  
**[0:27:56-0:27:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:27:56):**  stories.  
**[0:27:57-0:27:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:27:57):**  So that was the lucky part.  
**[0:27:58-0:28:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:27:58):**  The other part was, yeah, the story I just told about finding a farmer, that was perseverance.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:28:03):**  It was really struggling to find, and all the conversations we had were about values,  
**[0:28:09-0:28:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:28:09):**  not so much about skill sets or not so much about money or nothing at all.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:28:13):**  It was, how do you look at the world?  
**[0:28:15-0:28:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:28:15):**  Okay, you're on the same page.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:28:17):**  And that immediately led to a connection that, okay, if you are agreeing on this dot on the  
**[0:28:22-0:28:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:28:22):**  horizon, then we can start and then we'll see where it ends.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:28:26):**  And so there's no blueprint or whatsoever.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:28:29):**  But if you want to have some sort of a control, I think for this type of process, it's just  
**[0:28:36-0:28:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:28:36):**  meeting a lot of people, making sure that you're always open and vulnerable and asking  
**[0:28:41-0:28:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:28:41):**  the right questions, to be honest.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:28:42):**  But yeah, there's no blueprint to be honest.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:28:45):**  No, unfortunately, whenever we speak about land use, there's never any blueprints around,  
**[0:28:49-0:28:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:28:49):**  right?  
**[0:28:50-0:28:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:28:50):**  So it would make life so much easier, unfortunately.  
**[0:28:53-0:28:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:28:53):**  I think the value part is very interesting and not necessarily on the skill part.  
**[0:28:58-0:29:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:28:58):**  But because a lot of that you can learn.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:29:00):**  I had a discussion yesterday of somebody was hiring someone or is hiring someone, maybe  
**[0:29:05-0:29:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:29:05):**  they already did as we're recording this.  
**[0:29:08-0:29:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:29:08):**  And we tried to focus as much as possible on, okay, are the values and are the main  
**[0:29:12-0:29:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:29:12):**  value was connecting with other people of different types, a large corporates, farmers,  
**[0:29:17-0:29:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:29:17):**  etc.  
**[0:29:18-0:29:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:29:18):**  And everything else, and maybe he or she didn't know too much about regionic yet.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:29:21):**  But that you can learn if you're interested enough and you are able to connect with people  
**[0:29:25-0:29:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:29:25):**  from different backgrounds, then you can also learn about regionic.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:29:28):**  And that's not the most impossible thing if you're going to be the best farmer ever, but  
**[0:29:31-0:29:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:29:31):**  that wasn't the role.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:29:32):**  So I think that value connection is absolutely crucial.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:29:35):**  Yeah.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:29:36):**  And for us, when we started, we never heard about regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:29:39-0:29:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:29:39):**  Never.  
**[0:29:40-0:29:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:29:40):**  And now it's part of every conversation I had.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:29:43):**  That's five years, right?  
**[0:29:44-0:29:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:29:44):**  That's like nothing in a...  
**[0:29:46-0:29:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:29:46):**  Yeah, it's five years.  
**[0:29:47-0:29:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:29:47):**  But also in the first conversations we've had with Jeroen, it was about building soils  
**[0:29:52-0:29:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:29:52):**  and soil is important, but not even the term regenerative agriculture was there.  
**[0:29:57-0:30:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:29:57):**  But the fact that, okay, we're going for quality instead of quantity, that was basically it.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:30:02):**  And that was the common value that we shared.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:30:04):**  And from that point on, it took off.  
**[0:30:06-0:30:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:30:06):**  And where is Tommaso now?  
**[0:30:08-0:30:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:30:08):**  Actually, I'll link it obviously below for anybody.  
**[0:30:11-0:30:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:30:11):**  I think he shipped all over Europe.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:30:13):**  So anybody in Europe definitely get some bottles.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:30:15):**  I tasted it.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:30:16):**  It's very good.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:30:17):**  Where is Tommaso now?  
**[0:30:18-0:30:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:30:18):**  Five years, four harvests later.  
**[0:30:20-0:30:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:30:20):**  I mean, obviously it's a slow process.  
**[0:30:21-0:30:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:30:21):**  It takes, I think, two years to brew.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:30:23):**  And what is the company?  
**[0:30:25-0:30:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:30:25):**  We're in a crazy time.  
**[0:30:26-0:30:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:30:26):**  We're recording this as everybody is still in lockdown.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:30:29):**  Can you give us a bit of a lay of the land where Tommaso is?  
**[0:30:32-0:30:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:30:32):**  To give a little bit of context, I think what is crucial to understand is that it took us  
**[0:30:37-0:30:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:30:37):**  four years to come up with a product that was actually able to be sold.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:30:42):**  So when we started, it took us four years.  
**[0:30:46-0:30:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:30:46):**  So a lot of investments was required, especially time, obviously, but also money.  
**[0:30:50-0:30:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:30:50):**  And we were again lucky that we had two companies on board that could help us with that transition  
**[0:30:56-0:30:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:30:56):**  period.  
**[0:30:57-0:31:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:30:57):**  But it also made us fully focused on DIY.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:31:01):**  Everything we did was a do it yourself mentality because for instance, a soy sauce press, a  
**[0:31:07-0:31:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:31:07):**  can't find one on Amazon or it's not there.  
**[0:31:09-0:31:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:31:09):**  So we need to build it ourselves and with limited resources.  
**[0:31:13-0:31:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:31:13):**  And that is still part of our DNA in the sense that everything we do is about managing costs,  
**[0:31:18-0:31:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:31:18):**  keeping them as low as possible because it took us four years to have our first sale.  
**[0:31:23-0:31:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:31:23):**  And that first sale, our launch strategy, it's also good to keep in mind that when we  
**[0:31:29-0:31:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:31:29):**  started, we thought, let's brew it for a year.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:31:32):**  So the fermentation process, let's take a year for that.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:31:35):**  That sounded quite intellectual.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:31:37):**  So the four seasons, we all have seen some documentaries in which the Japanese would  
**[0:31:41-0:31:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:31:41):**  talk about seasons and whatsoever.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:31:43):**  And so that's how we started.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:31:44):**  But then after a year, Thomas and Pete were looking into the barrels and there was still  
**[0:31:48-0:31:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:31:48):**  so much fermentation going on that we were like, well, why should we stop?  
**[0:31:53-0:32:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:31:53):**  We basically said it to ourselves so it could also easily, yeah, let's stop when the fermentation  
**[0:32:00-0:32:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:32:00):**  stopped, when nature gives us the signal that it is done, let's say.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:32:04):**  And the only downside was that it took us two and a half years.  
**[0:32:06-0:32:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:32:06):**  So that immediately led to another year and a half of no sales.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:32:11):**  But in the meantime, we need to keep producing in order that if it would be tasteful and  
**[0:32:17-0:32:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:32:17):**  successful that we would need to have enough product.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:32:20):**  So every week you kept adding barrels, but you have no idea what the flavor of the first  
**[0:32:25-0:32:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:32:25):**  barrels would be.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:32:26):**  No, no.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:32:27):**  The biggest risk was that we would have enough soy sauce for ourselves for the rest of our  
**[0:32:30-0:32:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:32:30):**  lives.  
**[0:32:31-0:32:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:32:31):**  But yeah, so when we bottled our first bottle, we hand got the labels.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:32:36):**  It was so do it yourself.  
**[0:32:38-0:32:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:32:38):**  At the time it was, I think, Christmas 2017.  
**[0:32:41-0:32:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:32:41):**  And our launch strategy, if you can call it strategy, was, okay, everybody of the team  
**[0:32:46-0:32:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:32:46):**  gets 10 to 15 bottles, nice box, and we give it to friends and family.  
**[0:32:51-0:32:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:32:51):**  And that was on the day before Christmas, the 24th.  
**[0:32:54-0:32:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:32:54):**  We gave it to our friends and I was sitting together with obviously my brother-in-law  
**[0:32:57-0:33:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:32:57):**  with Christmas and we had an Instagram account with seven followers of which our family was  
**[0:33:03-0:33:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:33:03):**  six of them basically.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:33:05):**  But then we got tagged by two Michelin star chefs who was very impressed and we were like,  
**[0:33:11-0:33:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:33:11):**  who is this?  
**[0:33:13-0:33:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:33:13):**  And how did he get the bottle or she?  
**[0:33:15-0:33:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:33:15):**  Yeah, that was a friend of us gave the gift to him.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:33:19):**  So yeah, that's also a little bit about who he is that he gives, gives, he got himself.  
**[0:33:25-0:33:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:33:25):**  But yeah, that's a different story.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:33:27):**  But it's recycling.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:33:28):**  It can go the other way around.  
**[0:33:30-0:33:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:33:30):**  Exactly.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:33:31):**  So this friend wanted to help the company and buy and he gave it to Michelin star.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:33:37):**  Yeah, it turned out very well for us.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:33:39):**  And that having a guy cooking on that level, saying that about our soy sauce two days after  
**[0:33:46-0:33:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:33:46):**  we carefully told it to our friends and family, that was like, yeah, that launched us.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:33:50):**  So the year following, there's also maybe the thing that it's a frustration for both  
**[0:33:56-0:34:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:33:56):**  the farmer as well as the baker, my brother in law, who they are part of a system that's  
**[0:34:02-0:34:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:34:02):**  all about pushing.  
**[0:34:03-0:34:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:34:03):**  So they need to push their products in.  
**[0:34:05-0:34:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:34:05):**  It's all about cost efficiency, skill, all these rational way of looking at your business.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:34:11):**  And so a dream for both of them is creating a certain product that has a pool mechanism  
**[0:34:16-0:34:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:34:16):**  in it.  
**[0:34:17-0:34:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:34:17):**  And we have a saying in Dutch that say, bello of gebeltwort makes quite a difference.  
**[0:34:21-0:34:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:34:21):**  And it means you either start calling or your answer calls.  
**[0:34:25-0:34:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:34:25):**  And for us, as soon as the chef posted it on Instagram, it's only about answering calls  
**[0:34:30-0:34:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:34:30):**  for us.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:34:31):**  So it's a super lucky, luxurious position at the very end.  
**[0:34:35-0:34:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:34:35):**  And your question was, it's again, a long answer, I realized, but your question was  
**[0:34:38-0:34:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:34:38):**  where you are now.  
**[0:34:39-0:34:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:34:39):**  Yeah.  
**[0:34:40-0:34:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:34:40):**  For us, it's now, we're now two years and four months in business, let's say.  
**[0:34:46-0:34:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:34:46):**  And yeah, the growth is insane.  
**[0:34:48-0:34:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:34:48):**  It's we have doubled our production, I think a year ago, but that is to prepare for potential  
**[0:34:55-0:34:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:34:55):**  sales that we will have in two and a half years from now.  
**[0:34:58-0:35:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:34:58):**  So it's a quite difficult balance of, yeah, are we actually believing it happening versus  
**[0:35:04-0:35:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:35:04):**  aren't we overreacting whilst we are still, we still need to do a lot of the things ourselves  
**[0:35:10-0:35:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:35:10):**  because it's not that money's flowing in.  
**[0:35:12-0:35:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:35:12):**  We're still not making profit in a sense, but with the margins we have in the vertical  
**[0:35:16-0:35:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:35:16):**  chain, we are getting closer with every month.  
**[0:35:19-0:35:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:35:19):**  And related to the current situation we're in now, it's also a question you think asked  
**[0:35:23-0:35:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:35:23):**  is obviously all restaurants are closed at the moment in our main market in Netherlands  
**[0:35:28-0:35:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:35:28):**  obviously, and they take, I think 50 to 60, maybe even a bit higher percent of our turnover.  
**[0:35:34-0:35:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:35:34):**  So that's quite a big hit for our company, although online and people cooking at home  
**[0:35:40-0:35:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:35:40):**  is compensating a lot of that loss of revenue, to be honest.  
**[0:35:43-0:35:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:35:43):**  And again, we are lucky with our products because we can slow down the production a  
**[0:35:47-0:35:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:35:47):**  little bit and yeah, we can compensate it in the coming months again.  
**[0:35:50-0:35:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:35:50):**  So that's, I realized I mentioned a lot of luck in this.  
**[0:35:54-0:35:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:35:54):**  I think it's good.  
**[0:35:55-0:36:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:35:55):**  I think in the world of entrepreneurship and a world of stories, it seems always like such  
**[0:36:00-0:36:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:36:00):**  a logical path that the hero or the heroes took.  
**[0:36:03-0:36:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:36:03):**  And I'm always very happy when somebody said, actually, most of my success comes from pure  
**[0:36:09-0:36:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:36:09):**  luck, which I think is absolutely true, but it is very difficult for people to admit that  
**[0:36:14-0:36:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:36:14):**  because usually when somebody is right, obviously it was their decision when somebody is wrong,  
**[0:36:18-0:36:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:36:18):**  it was bad luck, which cannot happen in the same system.  
**[0:36:21-0:36:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:36:21):**  But no, I agree.  
**[0:36:23-0:36:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:36:23):**  But I think this actually goes exactly to back to what I tried to articulate in the  
**[0:36:28-0:36:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:36:28):**  beginning.  
**[0:36:29-0:36:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:36:29):**  It's luck will come if you start, you just have to do it.  
**[0:36:33-0:36:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:36:33):**  And if you do, then luck will come your way.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:36:36):**  I think there's really this kind of energy out there.  
**[0:36:39-0:36:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:36:39):**  For sure.  
**[0:36:40-0:36:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:36:40):**  It doesn't come if you don't start.  
**[0:36:41-0:36:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:36:41):**  I think that's the main, I mean, if you didn't take the flight to Kentucky, your brother  
**[0:36:43-0:36:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:36:43):**  in law, if you didn't, most people have an idea.  
**[0:36:47-0:36:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:36:47):**  I mean, I'm imagining many people had the idea of making soy sauce.  
**[0:36:51-0:36:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:36:51):**  Would it be possible to make soy sauce in France, in et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:36:54-0:36:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:36:54):**  And most and all of them didn't start or never really got off the ground, which I think comes  
**[0:36:59-0:37:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:36:59):**  to your point, Benedict, you need at least to start, which still means you probably fail  
**[0:37:02-0:37:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:37:02):**  because most companies and ideas don't work out.  
**[0:37:05-0:37:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:37:05):**  But either you learned a lot, you have a lot of soy sauce for the rest of your life, or  
**[0:37:09-0:37:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:37:09):**  it works, which is obviously what we were hearing now.  
**[0:37:12-0:37:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:37:12):**  And a big part of that is to create a bigger chance of getting that luck is to take small  
**[0:37:17-0:37:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:37:17):**  steps.  
**[0:37:18-0:37:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:37:18):**  So we quite oftenly ask ourselves the question, what if we would have started with a lot of  
**[0:37:23-0:37:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:37:23):**  money in our bank account?  
**[0:37:25-0:37:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:37:25):**  Then we would have approached it totally different than we would have built a large brewery.  
**[0:37:29-0:37:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:37:29):**  The website would look 10 times better, but it would also create a lot of additional pressure  
**[0:37:34-0:37:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:37:34):**  to level of success that we need to strive for.  
**[0:37:38-0:37:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:37:38):**  And by taking small steps, doing a lot of things ourselves and just investing, especially  
**[0:37:42-0:37:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:37:42):**  a lot of time, which is pretty precious obviously, but I think making small steps allows us to  
**[0:37:48-0:37:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:37:48):**  keep the pressure off slightly.  
**[0:37:51-0:37:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:37:51):**  And that gave us the time to proceed and persuade that level of quality that we're aiming for.  
**[0:37:57-0:38:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:37:57):**  And it's still part of our process, on our daily process.  
**[0:38:00-0:38:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:38:00):**  Start small.  
**[0:38:01-0:38:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:38:01):**  And obviously we all think big, but yeah, it's the start small and baby steps towards  
**[0:38:05-0:38:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:38:05):**  that bigger ambition.  
**[0:38:06-0:38:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:38:06):**  But we have the time we are not looking at the next year or the year after.  
**[0:38:09-0:38:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:38:09):**  We are looking at 10, 15, maybe even 20 years from now.  
**[0:38:13-0:38:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:38:13):**  And that's where we are aiming for.  
**[0:38:14-0:38:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:38:14):**  It's not that we are pressured by investors or by ourselves in a sense.  
**[0:38:19-0:38:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:38:19):**  This year we need to have this.  
**[0:38:22-0:38:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:38:22):**  Everything is small steps.  
**[0:38:24-0:38:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:38:24):**  Is that something you've learned or is that something you've always had in you?  
**[0:38:27-0:38:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:38:27):**  Because I have two hearts and one is somewhere around those lines you just mentioned and  
**[0:38:33-0:38:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:38:33):**  the other one is screaming quite loudly.  
**[0:38:36-0:38:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:38:36):**  Come on.  
**[0:38:37-0:38:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:38:37):**  I mean, it's just so much to do and so much you can do and achieve and move.  
**[0:38:41-0:38:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:38:41):**  Like I'm finding it sometimes very difficult to calm myself and be like, look, there's  
**[0:38:45-0:38:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:38:45):**  no stress.  
**[0:38:46-0:38:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:38:46):**  Let's do it one step or another.  
**[0:38:48-0:38:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:38:48):**  So do you have a blueprint for that either?  
**[0:38:50-0:38:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:38:50):**  To be totally honest with you, these are the most difficult conversations we have between  
**[0:38:55-0:38:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:38:55):**  me and Domas, but also with Jeroen.  
**[0:38:57-0:39:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:38:57):**  Because it's not easy, but it's the bridge between what we can do today based upon the  
**[0:39:02-0:39:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:39:02):**  financial possibilities that we have based upon the team that we have versus what we  
**[0:39:07-0:39:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:39:07):**  have in the pipeline as far as ideas, concepts, products, all the other stuff is concerned.  
**[0:39:13-0:39:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:39:13):**  That gap is insanely big with us because Soy Sauce is not the only product that you're  
**[0:39:17-0:39:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:39:17):**  going to launch.  
**[0:39:18-0:39:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:39:18):**  There are a lot of other products that we are aiming to launch in the same way like  
**[0:39:23-0:39:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:39:23):**  we did with the Soy Sauce.  
**[0:39:24-0:39:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:39:24):**  But it's a constant balance, finding a balance between, okay, we get a lot of opportunities.  
**[0:39:31-0:39:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:39:31):**  We see a lot of opportunities, especially the last thing, we see a lot of opportunity.  
**[0:39:36-0:39:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:39:36):**  But yeah, you can only do one thing at a time.  
**[0:39:39-0:39:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:39:39):**  And that's the biggest frustration to be honest, because we want so much.  
**[0:39:42-0:39:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:39:42):**  And sometimes, but the upside is that we are basically forced to take small steps because  
**[0:39:47-0:39:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:39:47):**  we are pretty strict on that.  
**[0:39:49-0:39:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:39:49):**  We don't want to have external pressure by having investors in whatsoever because autonomy  
**[0:39:54-0:39:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:39:54):**  is our holy grail.  
**[0:39:57-0:40:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:39:57):**  In the sense that we are so careful in protecting what we have that we don't want to have pressure  
**[0:40:03-0:40:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:40:03):**  on that asset 10, 15 year goal that we have.  
**[0:40:08-0:40:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:40:08):**  This is also really interesting from the perspective that, I mean, one of the big problems of having  
**[0:40:12-0:40:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:40:12):**  basically finding someone who's able to finance a transition.  
**[0:40:17-0:40:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:40:17):**  And if it's a classical bank model that we know, then that's exactly what happens.  
**[0:40:22-0:40:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:40:22):**  You become dependent.  
**[0:40:23-0:40:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:40:23):**  You have a third party.  
**[0:40:24-0:40:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:40:24):**  Even if it's an investor, you have to speak to and basically tell him or her what you're  
**[0:40:29-0:40:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:40:29):**  doing with the money.  
**[0:40:30-0:40:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:40:30):**  But at the same time, question back to you, if you would have someone that would offer  
**[0:40:36-0:40:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:40:36):**  you capital to take one or two steps faster or scale it up a bit faster, and he or she  
**[0:40:46-0:40:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:40:46):**  would be sitting on the same half of the table, basically not pressuring you, basically understanding  
**[0:40:52-0:40:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:40:52):**  slow processes, if that is the 15 or 10, 20 years time, would you in that situation also  
**[0:40:59-0:41:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:40:59):**  say no, I like the kind of pace and what it makes me focus on rather than saying, well,  
**[0:41:06-0:41:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:41:06):**  if I would have that great investor, then I will think about it differently?  
**[0:41:11-0:41:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:41:11):**  Obviously we're always open for those types of conversations.  
**[0:41:16-0:41:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:41:16):**  And the only thing, we have a pretty clear rule with the four of us.  
**[0:41:19-0:41:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:41:19):**  If three of the four smile, we do it.  
**[0:41:23-0:41:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:41:23):**  And the same goes for this.  
**[0:41:25-0:41:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:41:25):**  So if three of us think that's a good idea, then we'll do it.  
**[0:41:28-0:41:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:41:28):**  But it really depends then again on values, connection, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:41:32-0:41:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:41:32):**  How many times have you been the fourth one not smiling?  
**[0:41:34-0:41:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:41:34):**  Never.  
**[0:41:35-0:41:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:41:35):**  Thus far, we've all agreed on every decision.  
**[0:41:39-0:41:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:41:39):**  Oh, that's amazing.  
**[0:41:40-0:41:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:41:40):**  So that means that we never had any difficult issues to deal with, I think.  
**[0:41:45-0:41:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:41:45):**  Also related to the topic of this podcast, the transition, this is just a way.  
**[0:41:50-0:41:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:41:50):**  It's not the way or what-so-ever.  
**[0:41:52-0:41:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:41:52):**  Especially looking at the farm of Jeroen, he's a very entrepreneurial farmer.  
**[0:41:57-0:42:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:41:57):**  He has a lot of initiatives explored and he actually did it.  
**[0:42:01-0:42:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:42:01):**  And he's part of a lot of initiatives related to more direct supply to consumers, all kinds  
**[0:42:07-0:42:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:42:07):**  of initiatives that shows his entrepreneurial spirit in a sense.  
**[0:42:12-0:42:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:42:12):**  And we are one of these initiatives.  
**[0:42:14-0:42:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:42:14):**  So it's not that he has 350 hectares at the south of the Rotterdam.  
**[0:42:19-0:42:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:42:19):**  And to give you a little bit of context, I think now six or seven hectares is allocated  
**[0:42:24-0:42:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:42:24):**  for soybeans this year and another six, seven for wheat for the coming year.  
**[0:42:30-0:42:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:42:30):**  So that's 12 hectares for the soy sauce product and a lot of, I think, 10, 15 for a new project  
**[0:42:34-0:42:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:42:34):**  that is coming.  
**[0:42:36-0:42:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:42:36):**  So it's 5 to 10 percent of his total farmland now, which is already quite significant if  
**[0:42:41-0:42:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:42:41):**  you ask me.  
**[0:42:42-0:42:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:42:42):**  But it cannot be seen as the way to, it's part of the transition phase he is in.  
**[0:42:48-0:42:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:42:48):**  It's an element and not the transition phase.  
**[0:42:50-0:42:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:42:50):**  Yeah, I think it's crucial to, because it's also a huge risk, obviously.  
**[0:42:55-0:42:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:42:55):**  What if it doesn't work?  
**[0:42:56-0:43:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:42:56):**  What if after two and a half years, there was another good product coming out or a very  
**[0:43:00-0:43:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:43:00):**  bad tasting soy sauce?  
**[0:43:02-0:43:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:43:02):**  And if you had 50 percent, then already 50 percent of the farm with soy basically contracted  
**[0:43:08-0:43:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:43:08):**  for the soy brewery, it would be a huge disaster.  
**[0:43:11-0:43:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:43:11):**  Yeah, yeah, my answer to that is then it better be fun doing so.  
**[0:43:15-0:43:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:43:15):**  Otherwise it's bad luck and it's also not fun.  
**[0:43:18-0:43:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:43:18):**  No, no, obviously.  
**[0:43:19-0:43:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:43:19):**  What do you take away from this conversation, Benedict?  
**[0:43:23-0:43:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:43:23):**  Well, Joel Salatin always says a good thing is worth doing, even if it's done bad.  
**[0:43:28-0:43:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:43:28):**  So I think what I really enjoy about it, and I mean, this is, I think two things really  
**[0:43:36-0:43:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:43:36):**  and one that is predominant in what we do all the time is having fun, right?  
**[0:43:40-0:43:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:43:40):**  I mean, life is tough, cash flow is bad.  
**[0:43:43-0:43:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:43:43):**  There's so many risks and fears and stuff like that, but it's incredible work.  
**[0:43:47-0:43:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:43:47):**  I mean, we are outside.  
**[0:43:49-0:43:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:43:49):**  We can do what we want.  
**[0:43:51-0:43:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:43:51):**  We can create.  
**[0:43:52-0:43:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:43:52):**  We can build things.  
**[0:43:53-0:43:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:43:53):**  We can grow.  
**[0:43:54-0:43:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:43:54):**  We can create life basically, right?  
**[0:43:56-0:43:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:43:56):**  Obviously not.  
**[0:43:57-0:44:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:43:57):**  And that certain frame obviously.  
**[0:44:00-0:44:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:44:00):**  So having fun, enjoying what you're doing, getting up and having things that you love  
**[0:44:04-0:44:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:44:04):**  talking about, you love thinking about, you speak to everyone about having that basically  
**[0:44:08-0:44:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:44:08):**  that energy and that comes with a project that you fell in love with, I guess.  
**[0:44:13-0:44:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:44:13):**  So I think that's really crucial, having a new way, going to different routes and by  
**[0:44:17-0:44:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:44:17):**  that just enjoying what you're doing.  
**[0:44:19-0:44:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:44:19):**  I think that's the key thing.  
**[0:44:21-0:44:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:44:21):**  And then something which you said, I don't actually like being told very much, but it's  
**[0:44:26-0:44:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:44:26):**  probably true is that you have to focus on the single things.  
**[0:44:30-0:44:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:44:30):**  And once you do that, you obviously get much better at it or advanced faster or whatever.  
**[0:44:35-0:44:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:44:35):**  So I think that's interesting how you say, because we cannot do everything at the same  
**[0:44:40-0:44:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:44:40):**  time, we are forced to make sure that what we do is good and actually increases the quality  
**[0:44:47-0:44:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:44:47):**  of the product as well.  
**[0:44:48-0:44:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:44:48):**  I think that was, that's really interesting approach.  
**[0:44:50-0:44:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:44:50):**  I understand why you're saying that you don't like to hear that in a sense, because you  
**[0:44:54-0:44:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:44:54):**  want to do a lot of things at the same time.  
**[0:44:56-0:44:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:44:56):**  And that's true.  
**[0:44:57-0:44:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:44:57):**  And it's also not true.  
**[0:44:58-0:45:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:44:58):**  It's true because if we wouldn't have been all over the place for the last 10 years,  
**[0:45:03-0:45:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:45:03):**  then we wouldn't be able to connect the dots basically.  
**[0:45:07-0:45:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:45:07):**  So the fact that Jeroen was doing shorter supply chains, the fact that I was working  
**[0:45:13-0:45:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:45:13):**  in a more commercial environment, the fact that my brother-in-law did a lot of other  
**[0:45:19-0:45:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:45:19):**  different initiatives with gluten-free bakery, it all gave us the fuel to be able to do what  
**[0:45:24-0:45:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:45:24):**  we, and now we still are all over the place, but the daily operation should not be influenced  
**[0:45:31-0:45:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:45:31):**  by us talking about conquering the world and dreaming of whatever we can dream of.  
**[0:45:37-0:45:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:45:37):**  So there's a very thin line between the dreams and the ambition, etc. versus, okay, this  
**[0:45:42-0:45:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:45:42):**  is the reality of today.  
**[0:45:44-0:45:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:45:44):**  And those are the most tough conversations.  
**[0:45:46-0:45:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:45:46):**  I totally agree with you.  
**[0:45:48-0:45:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:45:48):**  Yeah, you put it nicely.  
**[0:45:50-0:45:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:45:50):**  So Koen, I think it's time for your famous last question.  
**[0:45:53-0:45:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:45:53):**  Yeah, I mean, I actually, I do have one.  
**[0:45:57-0:46:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:45:57):**  Where do you see, I mean, we're in crazy time.  
**[0:46:00-0:46:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:46:00):**  So predicting is very, very difficult, but you say you have a 15, 20 year vision.  
**[0:46:04-0:46:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:46:04):**  What is that 15, 20 year vision?  
**[0:46:05-0:46:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:46:05):**  I don't want to ask why do you see yourself in a year?  
**[0:46:08-0:46:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:46:08):**  Because we have no clue, but what is that long-term for Tommaso for the larger company  
**[0:46:13-0:46:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:46:13):**  you mentioned you're going to launch other products.  
**[0:46:16-0:46:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:46:16):**  Obviously you cannot mention many of those, but what is that long-term 15, 20 year vision?  
**[0:46:21-0:46:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:46:21):**  Well Tommaso is for us a brand.  
**[0:46:23-0:46:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:46:23):**  So a brand with products related to soy sauce, obviously.  
**[0:46:26-0:46:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:46:26):**  The company we're involved with is called Boorbacher Bert.  
**[0:46:31-0:46:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:46:31):**  And that is Boor, Farmer, Jeroen, Bacher, Thomas and Pete and Bert, my name.  
**[0:46:36-0:46:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:46:36):**  So the four of us represent, let's say a vertical food chain.  
**[0:46:40-0:46:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:46:40):**  And Tommaso is our first brand, our first collection of products.  
**[0:46:46-0:46:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:46:46):**  And the way we look at it is that, okay, if we have this up and running, which still is  
**[0:46:51-0:46:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:46:51):**  not the case, then why not, based upon the same philosophy, we grab another product that  
**[0:46:57-0:47:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:46:57):**  is already there for centuries, like soy sauce, and we approach it the same way.  
**[0:47:02-0:47:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:47:02):**  And inspired by wine and with the learnings we have in the blueprint we have from Tommaso,  
**[0:47:06-0:47:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:47:06):**  we create a new brand with a new product.  
**[0:47:09-0:47:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:47:09):**  And you can think of a beer, a bread, a liquor whatsoever, but products that have proven  
**[0:47:13-0:47:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:47:13):**  themselves over the years and do it our way.  
**[0:47:17-0:47:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:47:17):**  And our way is not rocket science.  
**[0:47:20-0:47:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:47:20):**  It's just doing it the way we are able to do it by having our own fields, our own crops,  
**[0:47:25-0:47:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:47:25):**  our own processes.  
**[0:47:27-0:47:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:47:27):**  And so if you ask me 10, 15 years from now, we hopefully have, let's say four or five  
**[0:47:32-0:47:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:47:32):**  categories, all supported by the farm with an experience center on the farm where the  
**[0:47:38-0:47:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:47:38):**  whole philosophy and the vision is shared that we can show our soil, that we can maybe  
**[0:47:44-0:47:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:47:44):**  even, I find it hard to use the word, but maybe even have an inspiring role in the sense  
**[0:47:50-0:47:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:47:50):**  that we can educate on how a food system should be working, according to us, to be very humble,  
**[0:47:57-0:47:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:47:57):**  but yeah, we want to open our doors.  
**[0:47:59-0:48:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:47:59):**  And those are things, talking about ambitions, that we are trying to do so.  
**[0:48:04-0:48:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:48:04):**  We are trying to open our doors as much as possible.  
**[0:48:06-0:48:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:48:06):**  Whoever, whenever, if you want to visit us, yeah, you're always welcome in the sense that  
**[0:48:12-0:48:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:48:12):**  if you can show it, people will believe it.  
**[0:48:15-0:48:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:48:15):**  We are never going to tell them that we have the truth, the monopoly for the truth, but  
**[0:48:19-0:48:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:48:19):**  for us, it's like the least we can do is show it.  
**[0:48:21-0:48:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:48:21):**  So 10, 15 years from now, I can invite two of you on our farm with our restaurant where  
**[0:48:28-0:48:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:48:28):**  you're eating bread, grown 15 yards from where we were sitting, basically.  
**[0:48:34-0:48:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:48:34):**  I think that's a great vision to end up.  
**[0:48:38-0:48:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:48:38):**  I want to thank you so much, Bert, for taking the time and obviously thank Benedict for  
**[0:48:42-0:48:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:48:42):**  taking the time and being on it.  
**[0:48:44-0:48:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:48:44):**  I think it was interesting, tasty.  
**[0:48:46-0:48:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:48:46):**  I almost got hungry and very informative as we don't have, I'm thinking of how many product  
**[0:48:53-0:48:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:48:53):**  focused discussions I've had in general in the podcast and for sure in this series we  
**[0:48:57-0:48:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:48:57):**  haven't.  
**[0:48:58-0:49:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:48:58):**  So thank you so much for explaining a bit more on how to go from soil to bottle and  
**[0:49:03-0:49:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:49:03):**  into plate.  
**[0:49:04-0:49:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:49:04):**  Thank you.

**[0:49:43-0:49:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:49:43):**  Dear friends of the podcast, I'm super excited to share with you the online video course  
**[0:49:48-0:49:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:49:48):**  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[0:49:52-0:49:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:49:52):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  
**[0:49:56-0:49:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:49:56):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[0:49:58-0:50:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:49:58):**  After a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of audio asking the question  
**[0:50:01-0:50:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:50:01):**  how to put money to work in regenerating soils, and I've been following the space since 2011  
**[0:50:06-0:50:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:50:06):**  and recording these podcasts since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  
**[0:50:11-0:50:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:50:11):**  What have we seen in this space over the last years?  
**[0:50:14-0:50:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:50:14):**  How have we built our decision-making framework?  
**[0:50:17-0:50:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:50:17):**  What to focus on with the podcast?

**[0:50:28-0:50:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:50:28):**  How to approach this space?

**[0:51:28-0:51:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:51:28):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides.  
**[0:51:35-0:51:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:51:35):**  So you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:51:37-0:51:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:51:37):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:51:42-0:51:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:51:42):**  is so risky.  
**[0:51:43-0:51:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:51:43):**  How to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to invest  
**[0:51:48-0:51:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:51:48):**  in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find if  
**[0:51:52-0:51:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:51:52):**  you're a soil builder.  
**[0:51:53-0:51:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:51:53):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:51:58-0:52:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:51:58):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:52:02-0:52:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:52:02):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:52:07-0:52:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:52:07):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:52:08-0:52:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:52:08):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:52:10-0:52:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:52:10):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:52:12-0:52:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:52:12):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:52:16-0:52:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:52:16):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:52:18-0:52:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/13/transition-finance-ep5/#t=0:52:18):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.

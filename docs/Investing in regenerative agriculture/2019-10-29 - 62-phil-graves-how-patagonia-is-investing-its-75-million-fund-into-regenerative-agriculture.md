**[0:00:13-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:00:13):**  This is an interview on how the sustainable clothing giant Patagonia is investing in organic  
**[0:00:18-0:00:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:00:18):**  regenerative agriculture and food.  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:00:22):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture, investing as if  
**[0:00:27-0:00:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:00:27):**  the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:28-0:00:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:00:28):**  This is a podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture  
**[0:00:32-0:00:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:00:32):**  space to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local  
**[0:00:37-0:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:00:37):**  communities and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:42-0:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:00:42):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:44-0:00:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:00:44):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:00:48-0:00:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:00:48):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:00:51-0:00:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:00:51):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:00:56-0:01:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:00:56):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:00-0:01:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:01:00):**  Before we get started, I've been recording these interviews next to my day job and I  
**[0:01:04-0:01:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:01:04):**  will definitely continue to do so and release about an episode a month.  
**[0:01:08-0:01:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:01:08):**  But at the same time I would love to take this further, share more interviews, there  
**[0:01:12-0:01:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:01:12):**  are many more stories to share on investing in regenerative food and agriculture.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:01:17):**  More depth, improve the quality, maybe even doing some video series.  
**[0:01:21-0:01:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:01:21):**  So I started a Patreon community which makes it easy to support creators like myself.

**[0:01:38-0:01:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:01:38):**  And now, without further ado, the interview.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:01:41):**  Enjoy!  
**[0:01:43-0:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:01:43):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:01:45):**  I'm here today with Phil Graves at the Patagonia headquarters and Thin Shed Ventures.  
**[0:01:50-0:01:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:01:50):**  Very excited to hear more about their work in regenerative agriculture and food and what's  
**[0:01:54-0:01:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:01:54):**  next for them.  
**[0:01:55-0:01:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:01:55):**  Welcome Phil.  
**[0:01:56-0:01:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:01:56):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:57-0:01:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:01:57):**  Thanks for having me.  
**[0:01:58-0:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:01:58):**  And to start with a personal question, what brings you into the space?  
**[0:02:02-0:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:02:02):**  Why soil?  
**[0:02:03-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:02:03):**  Why regenerative food?  
**[0:02:04-0:02:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:02:04):**  Well, soil is key to our future.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:02:06):**  I started my career working with a global consulting firm and I realized that we spend  
**[0:02:12-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:02:12):**  so much of our lives at work.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:02:15):**  Decoupling your craft from your personal values and interests is something that really bothered  
**[0:02:22-0:02:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:02:22):**  me.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:02:23):**  So that's what led me to Patagonia and Thin Shed Ventures.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:02:26):**  And then now when we look at some of our most intractable environmental problems that we  
**[0:02:31-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:02:31):**  face with the climate crisis going on right now, soil for us seems like our most compelling  
**[0:02:37-0:02:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:02:37):**  solution to help mitigate some of these problems like global warming.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:02:42):**  And with our food business, we make and sell apparel and we've done that for nearly 50  
**[0:02:47-0:02:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:02:47):**  years.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:02:48):**  You eat every day.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:02:49):**  And for us that's one of the key reasons we launched Patagonia Provisions, our in-house  
**[0:02:52-0:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:02:52):**  food business, why we have Thin Shed Ventures, our investment arm where we can fund regenerative  
**[0:02:58-0:03:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:02:58):**  ag and scale this movement.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:03:01):**  And that's what gets me excited each and every day to come to work and make the world a better  
**[0:03:06-0:03:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:03:06):**  place for my three young daughters.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:03:09):**  And when you look at the regenerative ag and food movement, we were talking about it before  
**[0:03:14-0:03:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:03:14):**  I started recording, it seems like we're having a moment and we're having a moment in the  
**[0:03:18-0:03:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:03:18):**  movement.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:03:19):**  What excites you the most at the moment when you look at regenerative ag and food?  
**[0:03:24-0:03:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:03:24):**  Well for me, the data has been compelling for a long time where you look at chemical  
**[0:03:30-0:03:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:03:30):**  ag, industrial ag, conventional ag, I prefer chemical ag just to call it what it is.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:03:37):**  There have been decades long studies, agricultural health studies that show that the incidence  
**[0:03:41-0:03:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:03:41):**  of cancer rates for farmers, the health of the soil, all of these things, the taste,  
**[0:03:47-0:03:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:03:47):**  nutrition are deteriorating at a rapid rate.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:03:50):**  Our health and the food that we eat is literally killing us.  
**[0:03:54-0:03:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:03:54):**  So it's been very refreshing to see some of these studies come to light.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:03:58):**  They've been buried in academic papers for a long time, but you're starting to see the  
**[0:04:02-0:04:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:04:02):**  movement with Roundup being banned and Germany, Bayer's backyard, that was the headline I'd  
**[0:04:08-0:04:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:04:08):**  love to see a couple of weeks back.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:04:11):**  And of course you can identify a problem, but that's not going to help anything if you  
**[0:04:16-0:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:04:16):**  don't identify a solution.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:04:18):**  And now with the spotlight being on regenerative or organic agriculture, it's something that  
**[0:04:23-0:04:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:04:23):**  Patagonia is keenly interested in right now.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:04:27):**  We helped develop a new certification called Regenerative Organic Certification, which  
**[0:04:32-0:04:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:04:32):**  of course is being tied to organic.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:04:34):**  It doesn't use harmful chemicals, but goes broader than that to encompass compassion  
**[0:04:40-0:04:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:04:40):**  to the workers that are key to the farmer supply chain, compassion to the animals to  
**[0:04:45-0:04:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:04:45):**  ensure that they're treated with dignity and respect.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:04:48):**  And then importantly, the soil itself too.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:04:50):**  So not just avoiding chemicals, which of course is a great first step, but looking at tilling  
**[0:04:55-0:05:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:04:55):**  practices and cover crops and crop rotations, actually building healthy soil that can sequester  
**[0:05:01-0:05:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:05:01):**  carbon and be one of our best shots at tackling global warming.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:05:07):**  And when you look at what you've done so far, you've been setting up a food brand, Patagonia  
**[0:05:12-0:05:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:05:12):**  Provisions, which I will definitely link below because you have a lot of amazing videos and  
**[0:05:16-0:05:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:05:16):**  stories to really explain the ingredients in that brand.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:05:19):**  You've set up a new certification scheme.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:05:22):**  What's next for Patagonia when it comes to, of course, what you can share?  
**[0:05:26-0:05:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:05:26):**  What's next for Patagonia when it comes to Intenshed Ventures, when it comes to Regen  
**[0:05:30-0:05:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:05:30):**  Food and Ag?  
**[0:05:31-0:05:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:05:31):**  What's most exciting for you at the moment?  
**[0:05:33-0:05:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:05:33):**  We're talking October 2019.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:05:36):**  I'm proud at what we've done thus far with provisions and Tenshed, but I really feel  
**[0:05:40-0:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:05:40):**  like we've just laid the foundation at this point.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:05:43):**  We've got a lot of great stories out there, whether it's Kerns of Beer, Kerns is a perennial  
**[0:05:48-0:05:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:05:48):**  grain that is a great alternative to annual wheat.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:05:51):**  It's got a deep root system that needs less water, fewer nutrients, and is a terrific  
**[0:05:57-0:05:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:05:57):**  regenerative crop.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:05:59):**  That's one example.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:06:00):**  We've invested in a buffalo company that's restoring the Great Plains of South Dakota.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:06:06):**  They make a delicious product.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:06:07):**  We're selling buffalo jerky through Patagonia provisions, our food arm.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:06:11):**  And then the most important part is the Great Plains ecosystem and the soil health and bringing  
**[0:06:17-0:06:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:06:17):**  bison back to the prairie.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:06:19):**  And that for us has been a great example to show that you can bring these products to  
**[0:06:23-0:06:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:06:23):**  market and build regenerative food supply chains.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:06:27):**  But if we stop there, we failed.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:06:30):**  We've got to get these practices to scale.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:06:32):**  And that's where we're delighted to see some conversations that are actually resulting  
**[0:06:36-0:06:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:06:36):**  in action with some of the bigger food companies adopting Kernza.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:06:40):**  Some of the biggest bison herds in the land are looking at Wild Idea over the fence literally  
**[0:06:47-0:06:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:06:47):**  and saying, hey, we like this practice of raising the bison on the prairie and harvesting  
**[0:06:52-0:06:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:06:52):**  them on the prairie.  
**[0:06:53-0:06:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:06:53):**  So there's no grain that's fed to them their entire life because that's how they were designed  
**[0:06:58-0:07:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:06:58):**  to be for thousands of years.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:07:00):**  So it's something that, to say it succinctly, we're looking to scale these practices over  
**[0:07:05-0:07:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:07:05):**  the next five years.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:07:07):**  And when it comes to investing, what do you see the role of Tin Shed Ventures in that?  
**[0:07:12-0:07:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:07:12):**  How do you see the role of an investment fund, a long term investment fund, but still an  
**[0:07:16-0:07:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:07:16):**  investment fund in the regenerative food and ag space?  
**[0:07:20-0:07:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:07:20):**  The key word you mentioned there is long term.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:07:23):**  When you transition to organic, as many farmers are painfully aware, it takes some time.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:07:29):**  It's a three year process to convert.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:07:32):**  Whenever you flip from conventional, your soil is dead.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:07:35):**  It's been growing crops on these synthetic harmful inputs.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:07:41):**  And the intent in chemical ag is to sterilize the soil.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:07:45):**  So out of the gate, you're going to have lower yields.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:07:48):**  You're going to not realize the organic premium.  
**[0:07:50-0:07:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:07:50):**  And it's a really difficult place to be in financially when you're trying to put food  
**[0:07:54-0:07:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:07:54):**  on your family's table, literally and figuratively.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:07:57):**  So for the investors that want to come to the table and fund this transition to regenerative  
**[0:08:03-0:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:08:03):**  ag from chemical ag, having that patient capital mindset, taking a long term view of the fact  
**[0:08:11-0:08:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:08:11):**  that this is a broken food system that we're trying to fix.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:08:15):**  And to fix it, it's going to take time.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:08:16):**  You have to understand that it's not simply just buying seed, working the tractor and  
**[0:08:21-0:08:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:08:21):**  then harvesting your mono crop.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:08:23):**  You're going to have to be really thoughtful about the crops that you play, what region  
**[0:08:27-0:08:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:08:27):**  are you in, what climate are you in.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:08:28):**  And now with global warming getting worse and worse every day, you're going to have  
**[0:08:32-0:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:08:32):**  to deal with extreme weather events, too.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:08:34):**  So it's finding the right creative farmers, problem solvers, giving them the capital to  
**[0:08:40-0:08:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:08:40):**  do great things, and then stepping back and not demanding, hey, what was our financial  
**[0:08:45-0:08:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:08:45):**  return last quarter?  
**[0:08:46-0:08:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:08:46):**  What's our net income last quarter?  
**[0:08:48-0:08:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:08:48):**  That's been our approach with Tench Adventures.  
**[0:08:50-0:08:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:08:50):**  We don't ask for financials on a quarterly basis.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:08:52):**  We target entrepreneurs doing the right things in regenerative organic ag and renewable energy  
**[0:08:59-0:09:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:08:59):**  and the apparel side on innovations that can help us build the best product with the least  
**[0:09:04-0:09:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:09:04):**  environmental harm.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:09:05):**  We equip them in what they need in terms of resources, and then we let them do the great  
**[0:09:09-0:09:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:09:09):**  things.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:09:10):**  So we don't check in and what we've seen as a result of that is on the venture side,  
**[0:09:14-0:09:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:09:14):**  we have a 100 percent survival rate.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:09:15):**  Knock on wood, that continues.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:09:18):**  The return on invested capital is quite good.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:09:20):**  We're proud of that as well.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:09:21):**  And it's because we have that long term view.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:09:23):**  The Chenards and Rose, Chenards are, of course, our founders and Rose is our CEO.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:09:30):**  They don't demand to know how's the fund doing financially.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:09:34):**  It's how do we save our home planet?  
**[0:09:36-0:09:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:09:36):**  That's the mission.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:09:37):**  And by doing that, taking that long term view, you're able to have that strong financial  
**[0:09:40-0:09:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:09:40):**  returns.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:09:41):**  And I would encourage others to take a similar mindset when they deploy capital.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:09:46):**  And I don't know if this has happened actually, but have you invested in farmers specifically,  
**[0:09:52-0:09:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:09:52):**  apart from the Bison maybe?  
**[0:09:54-0:09:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:09:54):**  And how has that been through the transition as a fund, which probably was set up more  
**[0:09:58-0:09:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:09:58):**  on the private equity side?  
**[0:09:59-0:10:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:09:59):**  Have you been flexible there?  
**[0:10:01-0:10:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:10:01):**  What have you seen in terms of your interaction directly with financing farmers, which is  
**[0:10:05-0:10:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:10:05):**  something that comes back to the show.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:10:08):**  Very often I hope to do a transition finance series specifically on farmers.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:10:12):**  So I'm very curious about your interaction with farmers directly.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:10:15):**  Again, the key is direct.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:10:19):**  Each time you give me a good word to latch on to, you have to have a direct connection  
**[0:10:22-0:10:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:10:22):**  with the farmers.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:10:23):**  That's what we found has been the best.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:10:25):**  So when we bring regenerative organic grains to market, buckwheat, for example, we actually  
**[0:10:31-0:10:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:10:31):**  go to the source.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:10:32):**  We meet the farmers, we shake their hand, we look them in the eye, we see the practices  
**[0:10:36-0:10:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:10:36):**  they're doing, and then we hear what their pain points are.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:10:38):**  So another example where we've deployed capital to help enable this supply chain and build  
**[0:10:43-0:10:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:10:43):**  it from scratch in some cases is for the buckwheat that we're using with the Patagonia provision  
**[0:10:48-0:10:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:10:48):**  soups, we learned that the flour mills in the US are solely concentrated on annual wheat  
**[0:10:57-0:11:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:10:57):**  and they don't have the ability to process any kind of ancient or specialized grains.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:11:03):**  And we had to get the product launched, ship it to Asia for processing.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:11:07):**  And then of course from a carbon standpoint, that doesn't make any sense.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:11:11):**  And then when you dig in-  
**[0:11:12-0:11:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:11:12):**  A lot of tea property as well.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:11:13):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:11:14-0:11:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:11:14):**  Then you look into the facts, we used to have thousands of local flour mills in the US that  
**[0:11:20-0:11:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:11:20):**  can process specialized grains with the industrial ag system where everyone's growing corn, wheat,  
**[0:11:26-0:11:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:11:26):**  and soy using Monsanto seed.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:11:29):**  Those infrastructure pieces didn't exist anymore.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:11:33):**  So we literally funded a flour mill from scratch and they built a flour mill that can process  
**[0:11:38-0:11:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:11:38):**  local regenerative grains like buckwheat and bring them to market through Patagonia provisions.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:11:44):**  It's probably something you didn't think you would fund when you said, let's do a number  
**[0:11:47-0:11:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:11:47):**  of soups.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:11:48):**  And then you went to do buckwheat and then you went to do mills.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:11:50):**  But it's probably also the exciting part of being an investor in regenerative food and  
**[0:11:54-0:11:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:11:54):**  agriculture.  
**[0:11:55-0:12:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:11:55):**  It's all connected, meaning that we have to completely rebuild the infrastructure, probably  
**[0:12:00-0:12:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:12:00):**  a lot more in grain and meat, et cetera, because most of that has been completely centralized.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:12:06):**  Also actually on the seed side, when you look at other investors in the space, what would  
**[0:12:10-0:12:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:12:10):**  you see, because you have a very free role and a lot of flexibility to do things, what  
**[0:12:15-0:12:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:12:15):**  would you say for others, let's say outside this building, what are the main barriers  
**[0:12:19-0:12:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:12:19):**  for them to become more active?  
**[0:12:22-0:12:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:12:22):**  Because I see a lot of them are very interested.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:12:24):**  They start to see food and ag as an absolutely key part if you're interested in healthcare,  
**[0:12:29-0:12:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:12:29):**  education, inequality, climate, obviously water.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:12:32):**  But still I don't see a lot of them actually moving into the space and being as flexible  
**[0:12:36-0:12:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:12:36):**  as you.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:12:37):**  What would you see?  
**[0:12:38-0:12:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:12:38):**  What would be the biggest barrier for them to be really joining you in this wave that  
**[0:12:42-0:12:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:12:42):**  you've been creating?  
**[0:12:44-0:12:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:12:44):**  You can join the movement apart from Patagonia.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:12:46):**  One of the things I'd encourage people to do is if you're working for a large food company  
**[0:12:50-0:12:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:12:50):**  that may say they'd like to move to regenerative, but you just haven't seen the follow-through  
**[0:12:54-0:12:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:12:54):**  and the action steps, is to create a clear case for why we should do that.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:12:59):**  I think you can look towards younger people and how they purchase food and clothing and  
**[0:13:04-0:13:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:13:04):**  every product.  
**[0:13:05-0:13:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:13:05):**  They want to ensure that it's made responsibly.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:13:07):**  They want to ensure that it's on the apparel side a durable good.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:13:10):**  For food, they don't solely care about price.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:13:13):**  They want to know how nutritious this is for me and how was the farmer treated in the entire  
**[0:13:18-0:13:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:13:18):**  process.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:13:19):**  How was the soil treated?  
**[0:13:21-0:13:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:13:21):**  Showing that business case and that you can see it manifest through large traditional  
**[0:13:26-0:13:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:13:26):**  food companies buying smaller brands that are trying to do things the right way, you  
**[0:13:31-0:13:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:13:31):**  can make that change within.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:13:33):**  Again, I would encourage those trying to shift their organizations to regenerative and organic  
**[0:13:39-0:13:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:13:39):**  ingredients and food to take the long-term view.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:13:43):**  This is something that on a quarterly basis might not pencil out.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:13:47):**  In fact, our founder, Yvon Chouinard, has said every time he makes a decision for the  
**[0:13:52-0:13:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:13:52):**  planet, it ends up making him money.  
**[0:13:54-0:13:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:13:54):**  But what he doesn't say is it may not be that next quarter.  
**[0:13:57-0:13:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:13:57):**  It's over the long term.  
**[0:13:58-0:13:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:13:58):**  It's the cumulative effect.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:13:59):**  I think taking the long-term view, looking at building relationships with farmers and  
**[0:14:04-0:14:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:14:04):**  having long-term partnerships instead of a simple transactional relationship, that's  
**[0:14:09-0:14:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:14:09):**  key.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:14:10):**  Then on the flip side, showing the business case that consumers are clearly moving towards  
**[0:14:15-0:14:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:14:15):**  this in their purchasing habits.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:14:17):**  If you are known as a brand that does things the right way, you build supply chains if  
**[0:14:21-0:14:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:14:21):**  they don't exist and get these regenerative and organic products to market, those are  
**[0:14:26-0:14:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:14:26):**  the brands that are going to succeed in the future.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:14:28):**  In fact, those may be the only brands that survive in the future.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:14:32):**  You mentioned consumers.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:14:33):**  Do you see, I mean, you're very much on the consumer side of things and on the producer  
**[0:14:37-0:14:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:14:37):**  side of things.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:14:39):**  Do you see that growing interest?  
**[0:14:42-0:14:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:14:42):**  I think many people in the bubble obviously understand region ag, understand region food,  
**[0:14:47-0:14:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:14:47):**  understand soil, but do you see a growing interest from the average consumer into something  
**[0:14:53-0:14:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:14:53):**  beyond organic or into something that really goes further in terms of soil building?  
**[0:14:58-0:14:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:14:58):**  I do.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:14:59):**  I think before I dive into the response, it's important to say how critical organic is to  
**[0:15:04-0:15:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:15:04):**  the foundation of regenerative, even if it's not certified.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:15:07):**  But the organic movement, while imperfect, it has made a lot of strides in the industry.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:15:13):**  If you look at the premiums that customers are willing to pay for organic, even if they  
**[0:15:16-0:15:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:15:16):**  don't fully understand it, that helps with the business case and funding the transition  
**[0:15:20-0:15:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:15:20):**  too.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:15:21):**  So for us being paired with organic in Patagonia as a company that's used organic cotton exclusively  
**[0:15:28-0:15:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:15:28):**  since 1996 and all of our products, it's something we're really passionate about.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:15:32):**  So I definitely want to just as a foundation lay the table for organic as a starting point.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:15:38):**  But then beyond that, building on organic of the good foundation, the solid foundation  
**[0:15:44-0:15:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:15:44):**  of organic is also really important too.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:15:46):**  We've done a lot of surveys with customers as we're looking to further the regenerative  
**[0:15:51-0:15:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:15:51):**  organic movement and ensure the rock certification scales well.  
**[0:15:56-0:15:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:15:56):**  And they care about these things.  
**[0:15:57-0:16:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:15:57):**  We've done customer focus groups across the country.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:16:00):**  So not just Patagonia customers or Dr. Bronner's customers, the types who would logically care  
**[0:16:06-0:16:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:16:06):**  about these types of products and demand it, but all over the country.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:16:10):**  And the universal feedback is that they care and they want to have a comprehensive certification  
**[0:16:17-0:16:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:16:17):**  and ag that doesn't use chemicals where the animals are treated with respect and the farmers  
**[0:16:22-0:16:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:16:22):**  and the farm workers are also treated fairly.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:16:25):**  These things matter.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:16:26):**  The word regenerative doesn't really matter to them.  
**[0:16:29-0:16:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:16:29):**  And I think we just have to use some really smart marketing and communication folks to  
**[0:16:32-0:16:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:16:32):**  help convey what we're doing to those customers because these are the type of products they  
**[0:16:37-0:16:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:16:37):**  want.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:16:38):**  Now that's very encouraging.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:16:39):**  And we probably, yeah, we need some great marketing people to figure out soil building  
**[0:16:43-0:16:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:16:43):**  or something that immediately that touches us much more.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:16:46):**  To come back to the organic discussion, what would you say, because I was just at a conference  
**[0:16:50-0:16:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:16:50):**  in Oakland on investing in region food systems and it was a lot of discussion around organic  
**[0:16:55-0:17:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:16:55):**  as we've heard the, I would say, even say horror stories of industrial organic plowing  
**[0:17:00-0:17:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:17:00):**  like there's no tomorrow, basically just swiping one chemical for, and let's say an organic  
**[0:17:05-0:17:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:17:05):**  chemical.  
**[0:17:06-0:17:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:17:06):**  And that's one of the reasons why organic probably has a bad rep and is not financed  
**[0:17:10-0:17:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:17:10):**  through green bonds because of actually a lot of carbon, a lot of habits in terms of  
**[0:17:16-0:17:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:17:16):**  workers, et cetera, that we don't want to.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:17:18):**  What would you say to a farmer that has been greatly reducing their chemicals, but is that  
**[0:17:23-0:17:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:17:23):**  that limit of cashflow, et cetera, and cannot make that jump yet?  
**[0:17:26-0:17:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:17:26):**  Is it absolutely essential to go organic first?  
**[0:17:29-0:17:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:17:29):**  Is there another route basically around and arrive at regenerative as well?  
**[0:17:33-0:17:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:17:33):**  Or is that really a first step you have to step to organic before you go to step two  
**[0:17:38-0:17:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:17:38):**  or three or four in terms of region?  
**[0:17:40-0:17:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:17:40):**  Yeah, fair question.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:17:42):**  I think organic at its core is a great starting point.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:17:46):**  The premiums I mentioned a few minutes ago, those are real.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:17:50):**  My background is in finance and I'm a CPA and you can't deny the fact that you can charge  
**[0:17:53-0:17:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:17:53):**  more for organic food.  
**[0:17:55-0:18:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:17:55):**  Now as newspaper headlines are increasingly showing, you can have bad actors in organic  
**[0:18:01-0:18:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:18:01):**  and you can have fraud in organic where you're buying some organic products at Whole Foods  
**[0:18:07-0:18:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:18:07):**  and it may not be actually organic and there's just a paperwork scheme.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:18:10):**  So that integrity of organic is incredibly important.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:18:14):**  And for us, you have to look at everything.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:18:17):**  That's why we built this comprehensive three-pillared standard rock where it takes into account soil  
**[0:18:23-0:18:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:18:23):**  health, it takes into account animal welfare, and it takes into account social justice at  
**[0:18:28-0:18:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:18:28):**  the farm level.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:18:29):**  We think moving a step in any of those pillars forward towards the high bar, whatever you  
**[0:18:35-0:18:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:18:35):**  want to call it, if it's rock or regenerative organic without being certified, that's fine.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:18:39):**  But we think we should take stock of where we are with our food system, acknowledge that  
**[0:18:44-0:18:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:18:44):**  it's broken, and then encourage others to make steps.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:18:48):**  We personally feel strongly about organic, but encourage people to look at what regenerative  
**[0:18:54-0:18:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:18:54):**  practices you can begin with.  
**[0:18:56-0:19:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:18:56):**  Look at using as few chemicals as possible with a very short-term goal to use no chemicals  
**[0:19:02-0:19:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:19:02):**  because we feel like, as you can see in the beautiful film by our friends at Apricot Lane  
**[0:19:07-0:19:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:19:07):**  Farm called The Biggest Little Farm, you can work with nature and have a farming and ranching  
**[0:19:13-0:19:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:19:13):**  operation that's in harmony with nature and use nature without paying anything to Monsanto  
**[0:19:18-0:19:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:19:18):**  for synthetic inputs to have solid yields, delicious food, and build a great brand and  
**[0:19:24-0:19:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:19:24):**  a viable business from.  
**[0:19:25-0:19:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:19:25):**  I think it's an excellent point.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:19:26):**  It will be a discussion we're going to have, I feel, many, many times as we have to explain  
**[0:19:31-0:19:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:19:31):**  soil building, but it's something we need to keep coming back to.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:19:34):**  I want to end with a few questions.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:19:36):**  I always like to ask, let's imagine there's, we're in a conference room here, but let's  
**[0:19:40-0:19:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:19:40):**  imagine there's a theater full of impact investors.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:19:43):**  They've read the books, they've been to The Biggest Little Farm.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:19:46):**  What would be your advice, obviously without giving investment advice, to get started because  
**[0:19:50-0:19:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:19:50):**  they haven't made their first investment yet.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:19:52):**  They haven't built or bought any farm, they haven't invested in a farm, they haven't made  
**[0:19:57-0:19:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:19:57):**  any investment in food and egg space yet.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:19:59):**  Where would you suggest them to, say, start looking?  
**[0:20:02-0:20:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:20:02):**  I'd say go direct and local if you can.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:20:05):**  I think the local food movement is important, but also we have to acknowledge that regional  
**[0:20:09-0:20:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:20:09):**  practices matter and wine in certain regions is better than wine in other regions, just  
**[0:20:14-0:20:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:20:14):**  to put it in kind of fun terms.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:20:16):**  But local is easy.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:20:17):**  So, if you look in terms of talking to a farmer in your area and understand where are their  
**[0:20:22-0:20:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:20:22):**  specific pain points.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:20:23):**  If they're already organic, how do they move to regenerative organic?  
**[0:20:26-0:20:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:20:26):**  If they're a conventional farmer that's spraying chemicals every day, ask them how their financial  
**[0:20:31-0:20:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:20:31):**  situation is.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:20:32):**  My guess is it's pretty bleak.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:20:34):**  It's all over the Wall Street Journal about how small and mid-sized farms are folding  
**[0:20:39-0:20:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:20:39):**  right and left.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:20:40):**  They're going bankrupt and the only ones that are surviving are the mega farms and even  
**[0:20:44-0:20:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:20:44):**  they are not doing as well financially.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:20:46):**  So understand what the farmers' needs are and see if you can deploy capital in a way  
**[0:20:52-0:20:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:20:52):**  that can help get them on the journey or on the road to regenerative organic.  
**[0:20:57-0:21:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:20:57):**  And in terms of your work at the moment at Dinch Adventures and Patagonia Provisions,  
**[0:21:02-0:21:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:21:02):**  what are you most excited about, what you can share, let's say what you're working on  
**[0:21:05-0:21:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:21:05):**  for the next few months, let's say until the end of the year or if we speak next year at  
**[0:21:09-0:21:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:21:09):**  the same time, what would you look back on and what really excited you again, obviously  
**[0:21:14-0:21:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:21:14):**  if you can share?  
**[0:21:15-0:21:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:21:15):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:21:16):**  Rock, as I've talked throughout the interview, is something that is our highest priority  
**[0:21:21-0:21:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:21:21):**  right now.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:21:22):**  There's a lot of science that affirms that regenerative and organic farming and ranching  
**[0:21:26-0:21:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:21:26):**  can sequester carbon in the soil.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:21:28):**  And with climate week happening, with young people and old people getting out in the streets  
**[0:21:32-0:21:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:21:32):**  and demanding action, pointing to solutions as a key next step and regenerative ag we  
**[0:21:40-0:21:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:21:40):**  think is again so important to build that healthy soil.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:21:44):**  Rock is imperfect.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:21:45):**  It's in the pilot phase right now.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:21:47):**  We're learning so much through the public comment period we had last year, through the  
**[0:21:50-0:21:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:21:50):**  pilots that are happening across the world now too.  
**[0:21:53-0:21:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:21:53):**  We are most excited about making Rock successful, raising our game in our own supply chain with  
**[0:21:58-0:22:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:21:58):**  cotton and with our ingredients for Patagonia provisions being sourced in South America,  
**[0:22:05-0:22:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:22:05):**  being regenerative organic certified here in the near future.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:22:08):**  And then again, we don't want these things to just be a Patagonia innovation where we  
**[0:22:12-0:22:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:22:12):**  make great environmentally responsible products tied to Rock and that's where it lives.  
**[0:22:16-0:22:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:22:16):**  We want the big food companies, Denone, General Mills, you name it, to take a look at Rock  
**[0:22:21-0:22:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:22:21):**  and maybe launch it with one product line, do an experiment, see how the customers react  
**[0:22:26-0:22:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:22:26):**  to that.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:22:27):**  My guess is this is going to be a good step where you're going to take many steps after  
**[0:22:30-0:22:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:22:30):**  that.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:22:31):**  And would you consider that as a success next year, let's say we talk in October 2020, that  
**[0:22:36-0:22:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:22:36):**  at least one or two of these major food companies have launched a single line of Rock products.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:22:43):**  Is that what you can consider success or is there something else you're targeting or measuring,  
**[0:22:47-0:22:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:22:47):**  let's say a year from now?  
**[0:22:49-0:22:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:22:49):**  We want Rock to be everywhere.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:22:50):**  On every grocery store across the world.  
**[0:22:53-0:22:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:22:53):**  Now that's an ambitious long term goal.  
**[0:22:55-0:23:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:22:55):**  I think a successful launch with some lines and sub brands within some of the big food  
**[0:23:00-0:23:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:23:00):**  companies and seeing how those do, proving them successful, making it a scalable model  
**[0:23:06-0:23:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:23:06):**  for the farmer financially.  
**[0:23:07-0:23:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:23:07):**  Because again, if it works for Patagonia and Denone, but the farmer is not doing well financially,  
**[0:23:13-0:23:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:23:13):**  that is not a viable model.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:23:14):**  So we want to ensure that we can set this up to minimize costs without compromising  
**[0:23:18-0:23:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:23:18):**  on the integrity of the certification, be successful with launches to the pilot and  
**[0:23:23-0:23:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:23:23):**  then have this take hold and see traction where it takes over entire businesses, a billion  
**[0:23:29-0:23:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:23:29):**  dollar conglomerates.  
**[0:23:30-0:23:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:23:30):**  And of course, the little brands, too.  
**[0:23:33-0:23:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:23:33):**  We feel it feel like the future is bright for smaller brands that are willing to do  
**[0:23:38-0:23:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:23:38):**  things the right way.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:23:39):**  And we want to support them as well as the big companies as they transition to regenerative  
**[0:23:43-0:23:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:23:43):**  and organic.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:23:45):**  If you could wave a magic wand and tomorrow morning wake up and feel has changed something,  
**[0:23:50-0:23:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:23:50):**  you could choose anything.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:23:51):**  What would that be in terms of food and egg?  
**[0:23:54-0:23:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:23:54):**  Well, moving away from chemicals would be the easiest thing to.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:23:59):**  And I think that's the the clearest first step.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:24:02):**  I'm a native Texan.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:24:04):**  And one of the things that I see all the time is when my friends have kids, they may not  
**[0:24:08-0:24:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:24:08):**  have eaten organic food previously, but they don't want to feed their baby pesticides.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:24:13):**  And they may not vote the same way as we do in California.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:24:17):**  They may not do everything the exact same way, but they care about the human health  
**[0:24:21-0:24:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:24:21):**  aspect.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:24:22):**  And when you look at organic and regenerative, organic, that chemical free aspect is really  
**[0:24:27-0:24:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:24:27):**  compelling to people.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:24:28):**  So I would love to weigh the magic wand and get rid of Roundup and glyphosate and any  
**[0:24:34-0:24:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:24:34):**  other harmful chemicals that are used in an industrial ag.  
**[0:24:37-0:24:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:24:37):**  And then, of course, you know, I'd love to think bigger than that, too.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:24:40):**  And beyond just eliminating the chemicals and ag, moving to regenerative and building  
**[0:24:46-0:24:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:24:46):**  a healthy soil and sequestering carbon and using that as a solution to fight climate  
**[0:24:50-0:24:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:24:50):**  change.  
**[0:24:51-0:24:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:24:51):**  And as a final question, I always say final question and I come up with two or three more.  
**[0:24:56-0:24:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:24:56):**  What do you believe to be true in regenerative ag?  
**[0:24:59-0:25:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:24:59):**  What others don't?  
**[0:25:00-0:25:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:25:00):**  And I borrowed this question from John Kemp and he always asks on modern agriculture,  
**[0:25:03-0:25:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:25:03):**  would I like to ask it on on region ag?  
**[0:25:05-0:25:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:25:05):**  So what do you believe to be true on region ag that others don't agree with?  
**[0:25:09-0:25:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:25:09):**  Well, unsurprisingly, I think the fact that organic should be paired with regenerative  
**[0:25:13-0:25:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:25:13):**  is important, again, whether it's ultimately certified or not.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:25:16):**  I think certification is one tool.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:25:18):**  But if you know your farmer and you source for them at the local market, you visit their  
**[0:25:21-0:25:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:25:21):**  operations.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:25:22):**  For example, I could go buy from Apricot Lane Farms and they don't have a certification  
**[0:25:26-0:25:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:25:26):**  and I'm good with that because I know John and Molly personally and I don't need to have  
**[0:25:29-0:25:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:25:29):**  that certification.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:25:30):**  That may not be the reality for most people, especially if you live in a city.  
**[0:25:34-0:25:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:25:34):**  So certifications do play a key role.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:25:37):**  And I think the fact that organic is paired with regenerative and the rock certification  
**[0:25:42-0:25:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:25:42):**  is incredibly important.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:25:44):**  And I'd encourage one of the big personal things that I have is that we can't look at  
**[0:25:48-0:25:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:25:48):**  regenerative in a silo.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:25:49):**  There are some organizations that say, like, let's only till less or let's reduce chemicals.  
**[0:25:54-0:25:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:25:54):**  And there's other initiatives and I won't name them and throw stones right now.  
**[0:25:57-0:26:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:25:57):**  And I think moving a step is good.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:26:00):**  But with the state of the climate crisis, things are really grave right now and we have  
**[0:26:05-0:26:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:26:05):**  to go big and take a comprehensive approach and look at every tool in our toolbox for  
**[0:26:11-0:26:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:26:11):**  regenerative ag, organic ag broadly and make solid progress on them.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:26:16):**  I think it's an excellent point.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:26:17):**  We saw it actually again and again with the presentation of David Montgomery in Oakland.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:26:22):**  And as he always says, it's very easy for farmers to stop tilling for a few years and  
**[0:26:27-0:26:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:26:27):**  then say, oh, this regenerative ag thing doesn't work.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:26:30):**  And unless you do the four or five principles, it depends a bit who you talk to.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:26:35):**  But it doesn't really work.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:26:36):**  And it takes time.  
**[0:26:37-0:26:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:26:37):**  So it takes I think we lose quite a few that are doing two of the three or three of the  
**[0:26:41-0:26:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:26:41):**  four and then a few years only down the line and say, this doesn't work.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:26:45):**  And they get invaded by pests like the biggest little farm.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:26:47):**  And if they would have given up at that point and start spraying, we would not have this  
**[0:26:50-0:26:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:26:50):**  amazing example.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:26:52):**  I want to thank you so much for your time.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:26:54):**  I want to be conscious of your time, make sure we end on time.

**[0:27:01-0:27:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:27:01):**  you have made and how you put money to work to restore soil, people and ecosystems.

**[0:28:14-0:28:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:28:14):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[0:28:15-0:28:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:28:15):**  After a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of audio asking the question  
**[0:28:19-0:28:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:28:19):**  how to put money to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011  
**[0:28:24-0:28:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:28:24):**  and recording these podcasts since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.

**[0:29:09-0:29:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:29:09):**  And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office

**[0:29:23-0:29:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:29:23):**  No.  
**[0:29:24-0:29:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:29:24):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:29:26):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you and I'm very aware  
**[0:29:31-0:29:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:29:31):**  that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very different means.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:29:36):**  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[0:29:41-0:29:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:29:41):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[0:29:44-0:29:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:29:44):**  Thank you.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:29:45):**  So what is this course?  
**[0:29:46-0:29:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:29:46):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  
**[0:29:52-0:29:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:29:52):**  so you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:29:54-0:29:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:29:54):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:29:59-0:30:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:29:59):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:30:05-0:30:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:30:05):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[0:30:09-0:30:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:30:09):**  if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:30:11-0:30:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:30:11):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:30:16-0:30:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:30:16):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:30:20-0:30:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:30:20):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:30:25-0:30:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:30:25):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:30:26-0:30:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:30:26):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:30:28-0:30:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:30:28):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:30:30):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:30:34):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:30:36):**  Before making any investment please find professional investment advice.  
**[0:30:41-0:30:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/10/29/phil-graves/#t=0:30:41):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking.

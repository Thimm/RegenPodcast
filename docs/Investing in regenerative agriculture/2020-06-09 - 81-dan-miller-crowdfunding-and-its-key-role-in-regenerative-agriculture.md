**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:00:14):**  Is investing in regenerative agriculture and food only for large investors?  
**[0:00:17-0:00:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:00:17):**  In this interview, we discovered the role of the crowd in financing the growth of regenerative  
**[0:00:22-0:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:00:22):**  agriculture and how the current crisis is speeding up everything and why the founder  
**[0:00:26-0:00:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:00:26):**  of this crowd investing platform has been personally financing the first deals on the  
**[0:00:30-0:00:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:00:30):**  platform.  
**[0:00:34-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:00:34):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture investing as if the  
**[0:00:38-0:00:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:00:38):**  planet mattered.  
**[0:00:40-0:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:00:40):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:44-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:00:44):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:00:49-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:00:49):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:00:54):**  Why my focus on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:56-0:01:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:00:56):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:00-0:01:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:01:00):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:02-0:01:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:01:02):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:07-0:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:01:07):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:01:11):**  In March last year, we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support

**[0:01:36-0:01:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:01:36):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:01:38):**  Welcome to another episode today with Dan Miller, founder of Stewart empowering people  
**[0:01:42-0:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:01:42):**  to invest in sustainable farms and the farmers who steward them.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:01:45):**  Welcome Dan.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:01:46):**  Thanks for having me.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:01:47):**  So I'm very, very excited about today as I think I've been telling a lot of people in  
**[0:01:52-0:01:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:01:52):**  the past, I would love for the crowd investing, crowdfunding, crowd lending movement to also  
**[0:01:58-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:01:58):**  come to regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:02:00):**  And I think with Stewart, you're one of the first in that space, or maybe even the first  
**[0:02:04-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:02:04):**  I'm very much looking forward to explore the role of the crowd in this regenerative transition  
**[0:02:09-0:02:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:02:09):**  and revolution.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:02:10):**  But to start with a personal question, what made you look into soil because you have a  
**[0:02:15-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:02:15):**  background in crowdfunding, but not in soil.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:02:18):**  So what was the trigger?  
**[0:02:19-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:02:19):**  What was the step?  
**[0:02:20-0:02:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:02:20):**  How did you end up working on regenerative farms and the funding of them?  
**[0:02:24-0:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:02:24):**  So the agricultural connection came from my mother's side of the family.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:02:27):**  They've been farming in the Chesapeake Bay since late 1800s in the Eastern shore of Maryland.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:02:31):**  So there is the largest estuary in the United States and over one generation it was destroyed  
**[0:02:37-0:02:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:02:37):**  with overfishing and industrial pollutant runoff and industrial agriculture.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:02:42):**  So she grew up on the farm.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:02:43):**  I grew up in Washington DC, one generation off the farm like many, but not directly connected  
**[0:02:48-0:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:02:48):**  to it.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:02:49):**  And you spend a lot of time out there and you saw a region kind of collapse economically,  
**[0:02:53-0:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:02:53):**  no value going to the local farms, a lot of the farms getting squeezed out by larger producers  
**[0:02:58-0:03:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:02:58):**  and the net benefit of the society and community being destroyed, but also the ecological consequences.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:03:04):**  So when I decided to commit myself to agriculture in this project, it was only going to be under  
**[0:03:09-0:03:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:03:09):**  the lens of regenerative sustainable practices that were focused on ecology first.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:03:15):**  And I've since learned that ecology first is actually the best investment too, but that  
**[0:03:19-0:03:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:03:19):**  it our society is not always, I would say known.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:03:23):**  And so for me, it's been connecting all of my background, family history, my experience  
**[0:03:28-0:03:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:03:28):**  prior to steward, and then now using all of those skills to help accelerate the growth  
**[0:03:32-0:03:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:03:32):**  of regenerative agriculture, focusing on capital, which is generally the first constraint for  
**[0:03:37-0:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:03:37):**  any farmer doing this type of work.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:03:39):**  Yeah, there's a lot to unpack there, but let's start with one piece.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:03:42):**  Do you remember when you saw your first regenerative farm or when you saw that potential because  
**[0:03:48-0:03:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:03:48):**  coming or visiting or having been in a region that's actually not regenerating, but degrading,  
**[0:03:54-0:03:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:03:54):**  that doesn't mean you also see the potential and the opportunity.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:03:57):**  So do you remember if there was a moment or a journey or a number of pieces which got  
**[0:04:01-0:04:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:04:01):**  you like, wow, agriculture could be different?  
**[0:04:03-0:04:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:04:03):**  There were two pieces.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:04:04):**  So Polyface Farms was in the region I grew up in.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:04:08):**  They're Joel Salatin, they're obviously very famous.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:04:10):**  Reading him was the first introduction to the ideas and we would buy products from him.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:04:15):**  I pushed my family once I read about him.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:04:17):**  So that was my first introduction.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:04:19):**  Wendell Berry obviously laid the intellectual foundation.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:04:22):**  I think he does for many people.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:04:24):**  I read the Unset Lake of America.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:04:26):**  Then that gave me the confidence to believe that there is an alternative way to agriculture.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:04:30):**  It's actually was the norm throughout most of history, except for the past hundred years.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:04:35):**  And the reason why ag is as it is today is because of policy decisions and incentives  
**[0:04:40-0:04:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:04:40):**  put in place, not just kind of circumstance.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:04:43):**  So that gave me the confidence to then look and find who are the farmers doing it differently.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:04:48):**  There was a farmer in the Baltimore area who I was connected to through a well-known chef  
**[0:04:52-0:04:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:04:52):**  and he was growing an heirloom variety of peppers called fish peppers.  
**[0:04:56-0:05:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:04:56):**  And that's when I started to realize these farmers growing really heirloom variety is  
**[0:05:00-0:05:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:05:00):**  really taking care of the soil, doing very unique products.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:05:04):**  They have no access to financing.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:05:06):**  They can't get funding anywhere.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:05:08):**  And that started that genesis.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:05:10):**  So it was definitely an interest in the farm.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:05:13):**  I don't think I ever connected to the economics.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:05:15):**  But then as I really started to work on Stewart and Red Wendell Berry, I realized the economics  
**[0:05:18-0:05:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:05:18):**  have to be aligned with the agricultural practices and it's a much more symbiotic relationship.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:05:24):**  Yeah, because you mentioned that probably the biggest bottleneck or one of the biggest  
**[0:05:29-0:05:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:05:29):**  bottlenecks is capital.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:05:30):**  It's not necessarily the not having enough good entrepreneurs or good farmers or entrepreneurial  
**[0:05:35-0:05:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:05:35):**  farmers, but it's capital.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:05:36):**  What made you see that?  
**[0:05:39-0:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:05:39):**  What made you discover basically that it's the lack of appropriate capital?  
**[0:05:43-0:05:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:05:43):**  That came from my business background before Stewart.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:05:46):**  So after school, I started real estate development business with my brother.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:05:49):**  My father's family is in real estate.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:05:51):**  We spun out to do our own projects in Washington, DC.  
**[0:05:54-0:05:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:05:54):**  We're investing in some emerging parts of the city doing historic restorations, leasing  
**[0:05:58-0:05:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:05:58):**  to local tenants.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:05:59):**  Those were outside of the traditional private equity type deals.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:06:03):**  So we built a platform to raise money from local investors to invest with us in these  
**[0:06:07-0:06:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:06:07):**  projects.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:06:08):**  That was called Fundrives.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:06:09):**  It was the first real estate crowdfunding platform that has since grown to raising over  
**[0:06:12-0:06:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:06:12):**  a billion dollars online, but was initially used as a vehicle for us to connect with a  
**[0:06:17-0:06:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:06:17):**  different type of investor.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:06:19):**  So around that same time, the buildings that we were leasing to younger chefs, I started  
**[0:06:23-0:06:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:06:23):**  to meet the farmers that they were buying from.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:06:26):**  And any of those farmers I spoke to, even though they're selling to well-known chefs  
**[0:06:30-0:06:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:06:30):**  and they're selling in the farmers market and everyone loves what they have, none of  
**[0:06:33-0:06:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:06:33):**  them had access to capital.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:06:34):**  And it just seemed like a huge gap where demand for their products is exploding, but they  
**[0:06:38-0:06:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:06:38):**  can't get the funding to get production up to meet the demand.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:06:42):**  It's kind of classic economics that they should be able to get that financing, but it's not  
**[0:06:46-0:06:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:06:46):**  available.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:06:47):**  So the idea with Stewart was taking the individuals that are supporting this movement, giving  
**[0:06:50-0:06:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:06:50):**  them the chance to invest directly in those regenerative farms and farmers.  
**[0:06:55-0:06:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:06:55):**  Not only is it available as much needed, but also rebuilding links in a food system.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:06:58):**  So that's where that connection began.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:07:00):**  And then in my research and early discovery of the business, it was clear that most funding  
**[0:07:04-0:07:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:07:04):**  in agriculture is driven by government policy from government direct lending or through  
**[0:07:09-0:07:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:07:09):**  banks that are effectively just lending through government programs.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:07:12):**  And if you're not a large commodity producer in the US and generally around the world,  
**[0:07:16-0:07:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:07:16):**  they've kind of followed this practice.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:07:17):**  If you're not a large commodity producer, you're ignored and you don't get financed.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:07:22):**  Whether that's by design or not, that's a different conversation, but they're left out.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:07:26):**  So 90% of the farms in the US are small to medium farms.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:07:30):**  Most of the market is this mid-sized to small-sized farmer.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:07:34):**  Many of them are sustainable, would like to do regenerative ag, but without the capital  
**[0:07:39-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:07:39):**  to grow, they can't get there.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:07:40):**  So there's a whole network, whole different types of farms all around the country and  
**[0:07:43-0:07:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:07:43):**  world that we support, but they all are persevering in the face of challenges and a little bit  
**[0:07:49-0:07:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:07:49):**  of funding goes such a long way for them to grow their businesses.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:07:52):**  Yeah, just to emphasize, basically the first response of many people that are not an ag  
**[0:07:57-0:08:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:07:57):**  would be, okay, you have a thriving business, a lot of room to grow, a chef that were buying  
**[0:08:02-0:08:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:08:02):**  probably before the crisis, hopefully will be buying after, or a lot of customers on  
**[0:08:06-0:08:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:08:06):**  your markets, RICO rings, et cetera.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:08:08):**  Why don't you go to a local bank and just get a loan to grow?  
**[0:08:11-0:08:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:08:11):**  But local banks are either ignoring ag or are focusing on the type of ag that is not  
**[0:08:17-0:08:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:08:17):**  this.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:08:18):**  Interesting.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:08:19):**  And that's where it gets structural of the economic systems we build are focused on larger  
**[0:08:23-0:08:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:08:23):**  companies and more standardized practices.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:08:26):**  So for a smaller scale farm that has a product that's not a classic commodity, so the market  
**[0:08:31-0:08:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:08:31):**  value is kind of unknown.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:08:32):**  They're a little unique in how they run their business and the location and the risk.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:08:36):**  A bit weird.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:08:37):**  Yeah, they're strange.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:08:38):**  They're kind of artists a lot of the times, they're different.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:08:40):**  So they would have trouble getting financing anyway through traditional channels, but the  
**[0:08:43-0:08:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:08:43):**  fact that they're not in the bucket that the bank can lend to at low risk, they don't do  
**[0:08:47-0:08:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:08:47):**  that.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:08:48):**  And in the US, most community banks have closed, credit unions have closed.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:08:51):**  So there's been a consolidation of money to the large financial institutions.  
**[0:08:55-0:08:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:08:55):**  And this is just not something they're going to touch.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:08:57):**  So the point of Stewart is to bring the capital back locally or regionally, some international,  
**[0:09:03-0:09:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:09:03):**  but at the end of the day, if you can fund farms from capital within the region, they're  
**[0:09:06-0:09:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:09:06):**  getting the benefit of the farm, the land's being helped, they're buying products, they're  
**[0:09:10-0:09:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:09:10):**  getting a return.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:09:11):**  And that's the framework of Stewart, not us as the investment decision maker, but us providing  
**[0:09:15-0:09:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:09:15):**  the tools for these networks to raise capital and finance farms and us having a balance  
**[0:09:20-0:09:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:09:20):**  sheet to do deals as needed to fill the gaps.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:09:22):**  But ideally, we're just providing tool sets that people can use as well for these farms  
**[0:09:26-0:09:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:09:26):**  in their communities to raise capital.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:09:28):**  And I mean, we've mentioned Stewart a few times now, can you walk us through an example  
**[0:09:32-0:09:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:09:32):**  of how that works in practice?  
**[0:09:34-0:09:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:09:34):**  What kind of farm, what type of farm, why would they raise capital?  
**[0:09:38-0:09:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:09:38):**  What kind of capital, etc?  
**[0:09:39-0:09:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:09:39):**  What is a good example that gives a bit of color to what we discussed?  
**[0:09:42-0:09:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:09:42):**  I'll give a few examples.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:09:44):**  I'll start with one of the first that was one of the smallest.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:09:46):**  When I was starting this, I was connected to a few urban farms in Detroit.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:09:50):**  I find them fascinating.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:09:52):**  The city has 10,000 acres of excess land that's unused and they have a burgeoning urban farming  
**[0:09:58-0:09:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:09:58):**  scene.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:09:59):**  It seems like a perfect mix.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:10:00):**  Well, these farmers were struggling to be able to buy land from the city for a host  
**[0:10:02-0:10:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:10:02):**  of reasons.  
**[0:10:03-0:10:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:10:03):**  So we stepped in.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:10:04):**  I was a farmer farming on 16th an acre of land in Detroit.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:10:08):**  One 16th, just for the...  
**[0:10:10-0:10:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:10:10):**  16th, basically a lot, a side lot.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:10:13):**  What would have been a house lot that is an acre of land.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:10:15):**  It was next door to his uncle's dry cleaner.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:10:17):**  Fisheye Farms is the name of the farm.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:10:19):**  And they just started.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:10:20):**  They had gotten into urban farming in Chicago University.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:10:22):**  They didn't come from farm backgrounds.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:10:24):**  They farmed locally.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:10:25):**  They had a lot of success and now they needed to expand production.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:10:28):**  So we came in, we provided funding as a mortgage loan, $120,000 loan that helped them buy a  
**[0:10:33-0:10:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:10:33):**  few acres, make investments in fencing, wash and pack, refrigeration, have a farm stand.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:10:39):**  And the kind of basic elements needed for that type of urban fruit vegetable farm.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:10:44):**  They've since grown their revenue to 200K estimated this coming year in two years.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:10:49):**  And by unlocking their potential to grow more products and sell more direct, they're able  
**[0:10:53-0:10:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:10:53):**  to have a bigger impact on the land, but also serve in bigger markets.  
**[0:10:56-0:11:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:10:56):**  So they've now, particularly since COVID has hit, had tons of direct sales.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:11:00):**  Their people come to the farm stand, they're doing pre-packed pickup.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:11:03):**  They're just perfectly positioned to meet the need of the local community.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:11:07):**  And then a recent farm, to show the other side of it, was a 1700 acre livestock farm,  
**[0:11:12-0:11:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:11:12):**  a bison ranch in Montana.  
**[0:11:14-0:11:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:11:14):**  Bison for me, just like, what's more exciting than bringing American bison back to restore  
**[0:11:18-0:11:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:11:18):**  the grassland.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:11:19):**  So this farmer is similarly passionate and 1700 acres, and we helped him finance a USDA  
**[0:11:27-0:11:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:11:27):**  certified mobile slaughter unit so he could field harvest and sell all around the country.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:11:32):**  This was prior to the kind of processing issues that are happening in the US and elsewhere.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:11:36):**  No, but they were already there.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:11:37):**  Yeah, of course.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:11:38):**  They were already there.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:11:39):**  Now they've just fallen apart, but they always existed.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:11:41):**  So a lot of what Stuart has become is financing the farmers, but financing also the infrastructure  
**[0:11:45-0:11:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:11:45):**  needed to get the product to market because they're all connected to where we were saying  
**[0:11:49-0:11:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:11:49):**  with banking is everything's now at a national global level.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:11:52):**  So if you're looking for smaller scale pools of funding or infrastructure or farms of those  
**[0:11:56-0:11:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:11:56):**  size, there's really nothing.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:11:58):**  I can imagine that, I mean, that slaughter facility, how much was that?  
**[0:12:01-0:12:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:12:01):**  Just a rough number, if that's public?  
**[0:12:04-0:12:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:12:04):**  That was $85,000 and he got a grant for 75% of it as matched funding.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:12:11):**  So in reality, we helped him with the grant, helped him with the financing.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:12:14):**  It's not that it was that complicated or huge amount of money.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:12:17):**  It's just these farmers don't have, they can't just write a check out of their pocket for  
**[0:12:22-0:12:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:12:22):**  these types of expenses.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:12:23):**  So, of course.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:12:24):**  So they were generally providing loans to the farmers on average eight to 10% interest  
**[0:12:29-0:12:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:12:29):**  rate.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:12:30):**  They're offering loans, high leverage, generally secured as mortgages, but sometimes we'll  
**[0:12:34-0:12:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:12:34):**  do shorter term operating loans.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:12:37):**  So our view is investors need to be compensated for the risks they're taking.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:12:41):**  There's always inherently risk in agriculture and regenerative ag.  
**[0:12:44-0:12:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:12:44):**  I think regenerative ag has less risk because they control more of the variables for their  
**[0:12:48-0:12:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:12:48):**  farm, but that's a separate argument.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:12:49):**  But high single digits is what we found for investors who are writing checks.  
**[0:12:53-0:12:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:12:53):**  And initially I personally funded the network of these farms of what feels reasonable, what  
**[0:12:58-0:12:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:12:58):**  feels like a return.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:12:59):**  And I think that's where investing regenerative ag needs to go.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:13:03):**  The past generation had no return focus and it was one or 2% could be fine to really bring  
**[0:13:08-0:13:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:13:08):**  the global market in of individuals to support this.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:13:11):**  There has to be better return, but at the end of the day, the farms can generate those  
**[0:13:15-0:13:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:13:15):**  returns.  
**[0:13:16-0:13:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:13:16):**  So that's what we've learned at Stewart is with the right mix of funding, they're accelerating  
**[0:13:19-0:13:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:13:19):**  their business incredibly fast and they can easily afford to pay with these rates.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:13:24):**  And then we also offer at Stewart help accessing traditional funding if it's there.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:13:28):**  So we can help them refinance into traditional longer term loans.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:13:32):**  So what began as us writing the checks is now much broader of sustainable farms, regenerative  
**[0:13:37-0:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:13:37):**  farms come to us.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:13:39):**  We learn about their business.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:13:40):**  We make recommendations on what funding's out there between either us or other sources,  
**[0:13:45-0:13:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:13:45):**  grants as well.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:13:46):**  And then what do they need to move forward?  
**[0:13:48-0:13:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:13:48):**  So it's become very comprehensive because as you can imagine, these generally regenerative  
**[0:13:52-0:13:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:13:52):**  farmers are not focused on financing.  
**[0:13:54-0:13:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:13:54):**  It's not an interest for them, but it's important.  
**[0:13:57-0:14:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:13:57):**  It's key and I think, can you elaborate a bit on the interest rates?  
**[0:14:01-0:14:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:14:01):**  Because I think for some people that sounds pretty high, but you say they are, you find  
**[0:14:06-0:14:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:14:06):**  customers in this case, the farms as customers and they agree on that, which means there  
**[0:14:11-0:14:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:14:11):**  is space to do it.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:14:12):**  And you say there's enough space and margins in their business to easily afford it.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:14:17):**  What do you say to people that say, wow, that's seems quite expensive in terms of capital?  
**[0:14:21-0:14:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:14:21):**  So in the market of general financing, it would still be relatively cheap.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:14:25):**  I mean, private real estate loans are done at those rates are higher often and particularly  
**[0:14:30-0:14:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:14:30):**  ones where the collateral here is still land in the business, but is less traditional.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:14:35):**  So it's what can the business afford?  
**[0:14:38-0:14:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:14:38):**  So for us, it's figuring out where can they get to an investment in value out of processing  
**[0:14:42-0:14:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:14:42):**  can double the revenue.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:14:44):**  That investment of 85K can triple or quadruple revenue to now sell direct.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:14:48):**  So it's unlocking the investments that really drive value on their end.  
**[0:14:51-0:14:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:14:51):**  And then we want to bring them as cheap capital as possible.  
**[0:14:54-0:15:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:14:54):**  So we have a platform where people can invest as more capital comes online and people accept  
**[0:15:00-0:15:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:15:00):**  lower rates that can be provided.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:15:02):**  We also help the farmers find grants, which effectively subsidizes the rates, which helps  
**[0:15:06-0:15:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:15:06):**  a lot.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:15:07):**  And then we can work alongside traditional funding as it's available.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:15:10):**  We just did a deal in Oregon where the farm service agency did the first mortgage for  
**[0:15:16-0:15:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:15:16):**  600,000, 40 year mortgage at 3.12%, which just shows how subsidized the American system  
**[0:15:22-0:15:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:15:22):**  is once you access it.  
**[0:15:23-0:15:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:15:23):**  You know, a small farm borrowing at the cost of treasuries basically.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:15:27):**  But the local government lender can only lend up to 600K as a cap in the state.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:15:32):**  The land costs 800,000.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:15:34):**  Now the farmers nowhere, you know, and we've stepped in as a second mortgage to fill the  
**[0:15:39-0:15:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:15:39):**  gap for 150K and that was at 10%.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:15:43):**  So the blended rate is low and without that money, the deal wasn't happening.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:15:46):**  And now they're on the land and they're growing and we're funding irrigation and processing.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:15:50):**  So I see the returns being there in the underlying business, but definitely the traditional market  
**[0:15:55-0:16:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:15:55):**  for ag investing is thinking about lower returns.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:16:00):**  But I think at the end of the day, they should be shared among the farmers and the investors.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:16:04):**  I think traditional ag struggles with returns.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:16:06):**  I see for these sustainable farms, there's a lot of opportunity.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:16:10):**  And in terms of, because the two things that come back in the transition finance for farmers  
**[0:16:15-0:16:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:16:15):**  series, but actually in many conversations are both flexibility and time.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:16:19):**  Yeah.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:16:20):**  Meaning built in flexibility in investment products is something very interesting.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:16:25):**  We'd love to hear your thoughts on that and time.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:16:27):**  Like a lot of these businesses take a bit of time.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:16:30):**  It's not a one or two years, maybe the processing plant.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:16:32):**  Yes.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:16:33):**  But obviously if you're going to irrigation, going to perennial crops, et cetera, and time  
**[0:16:37-0:16:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:16:37):**  is key and investors need to understand that.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:16:40):**  Yeah.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:16:41):**  But let's start with the flexibility.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:16:42):**  How do you tackle the weather risk?  
**[0:16:44-0:16:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:16:44):**  I mean, one bad year risk, et cetera, et cetera, in terms of the slums that sound quite static.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:16:49):**  So that's our biggest strength that they're private loans and so they can be structured.  
**[0:16:55-0:16:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:16:55):**  However, it's appropriate for the farm.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:16:57):**  For that first loan I mentioned for the urban farm in Detroit, the first year interest was  
**[0:17:02-0:17:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:17:02):**  accrued and then the interest slowly phases in.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:17:04):**  So they have time to make these investments and start to generate cashflow.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:17:08):**  Those loans were five years and we're now refinancing them into traditional longer term  
**[0:17:12-0:17:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:17:12):**  loans from credit unions because now they own the land and have historical financials  
**[0:17:16-0:17:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:17:16):**  to meet those requirements.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:17:17):**  So I think structuring is the most important thing that's missing.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:17:21):**  Right now the ag financing system is like, here's the product, take it or leave it.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:17:25):**  It's a bank style product and it is not going to meet your specific needs.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:17:29):**  And what we found is cost of capital is not actually the problem.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:17:33):**  It needs to be reasonable, but that's not the problem.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:17:35):**  It's access to funding and then funding structure in the right way.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:17:38):**  That's really the primary problem.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:17:40):**  And then if they can get it structured in the right way where they have time to grow  
**[0:17:43-0:17:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:17:43):**  the business, where it's enough term to have the payback and where it gets them a bridge  
**[0:17:47-0:17:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:17:47):**  to traditional funding a few years down the road, then it works perfectly.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:17:51):**  So that's the big differentiator.  
**[0:17:53-0:17:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:17:53):**  There's very little private lending capital in agriculture.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:17:57):**  And I think in general, private investment capital offers the flexibility to meet these  
**[0:18:01-0:18:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:18:01):**  farmers where they are.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:18:03):**  And in terms of flexibility, have you looked at or experimented with, I don't know, with  
**[0:18:07-0:18:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:18:07):**  any of the, let's say not fixed interest rates, but connected to free cashflow, connected  
**[0:18:12-0:18:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:18:12):**  to profit sharing?  
**[0:18:13-0:18:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:18:13):**  Is that something you have been thinking either thinking of and using or is it something that  
**[0:18:18-0:18:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:18:18):**  is not a fit yet?  
**[0:18:20-0:18:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:18:20):**  That is something that we're implementing.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:18:21):**  So there's two ways people can invest on Steward.  
**[0:18:24-0:18:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:18:24):**  They can come to the platform and invest in the farms or the fund that we have set up,  
**[0:18:29-0:18:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:18:29):**  the Steward Farm Trust.  
**[0:18:30-0:18:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:18:30):**  And that's us underwriting the deals, writing the check ourselves, doing all the due diligence.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:18:35):**  When you say us, it's you underwriting.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:18:37):**  Us as Steward.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:18:38):**  Well, I mean our team, but yes, us is.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:18:39):**  So they're reliant on us and our underwriting and securing a mortgage and making sure everything  
**[0:18:44-0:18:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:18:44):**  works.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:18:45):**  We're also now rolled out our software to farmers where they can use the fundraising  
**[0:18:49-0:18:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:18:49):**  tool we have built, which allows them to distribute an offering in a compliant way, raise funding.  
**[0:18:55-0:18:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:18:55):**  And we're setting up some of those offerings as revenue shares, particularly the ones that  
**[0:18:59-0:19:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:18:59):**  allow anybody to invest.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:19:01):**  So we're working with say in Oregon, we have a license now where any Oregon resident can  
**[0:19:05-0:19:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:19:05):**  invest in the Oregon farms in our platform, little as $100 or any amount there where you  
**[0:19:10-0:19:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:19:10):**  have a lot of smaller investors and you want to align their interests with the farm to  
**[0:19:14-0:19:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:19:14):**  promote the farm, to buy from the farm, to really engage.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:19:17):**  That's where I think rev share works.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:19:18):**  So I view the kind of accredited style investors that are investing 10 to 25K and up.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:19:24):**  They want classic collateral mortgages.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:19:26):**  We have some tax free products.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:19:29):**  Everyone loves that, of course.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:19:30):**  Whereas the local investor that just loves that farm, they buy from them, they see them  
**[0:19:34-0:19:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:19:34):**  at the farmer's market.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:19:35):**  They're going to put in a thousand bucks.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:19:37):**  They're more suited to a project where they're going to get some products and they'll get  
**[0:19:40-0:19:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:19:40):**  a share of revenue.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:19:42):**  So we're adapting the structure to the need of the farmer and to where it sits in the  
**[0:19:46-0:19:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:19:46):**  capital stack.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:19:47):**  Yeah, because for now, most of what you've described is accessible for accredited investors  
**[0:19:54-0:19:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:19:54):**  and up because of legislation, right?  
**[0:19:56-0:20:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:19:56):**  Except for the Oregon PCU you just mentioned, like the two farms you mentioned, the processing  
**[0:20:00-0:20:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:20:00):**  unit, et cetera, isn't yet accessible for somebody to put in a hundred bucks.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:20:06):**  So we do have a product that's available to any U S resident, non accredited as well as  
**[0:20:11-0:20:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:20:11):**  little as a hundred.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:20:12):**  That's called the steward farm trust.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:20:13):**  So that vehicle makes loans to all the farms in the steward platform.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:20:18):**  And then as it earns interest, pays out dividends.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:20:20):**  So that was set up to channel small dollar individual investors alongside that accredited  
**[0:20:26-0:20:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:20:26):**  high net worth, have more flexibility to invest either in that fund or an individual deals  
**[0:20:30-0:20:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:20:30):**  or in portfolios of deals.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:20:32):**  What we've been trying to do from the start, and this goes to my background at Fundrise  
**[0:20:35-0:20:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:20:35):**  too, of how do we get individuals at a local level investing in these farms?  
**[0:20:40-0:20:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:20:40):**  The regulatory costs to do that in the U S is a hundred thousand dollars or so.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:20:44):**  You know, it doesn't work for a farmer trying to get a hundred thousand, but we're now innovating  
**[0:20:48-0:20:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:20:48):**  on state based crowdfunding rules where as long as all the residents are from the state,  
**[0:20:53-0:20:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:20:53):**  the farms from they're exempt from federal law under state law, we've have certain States  
**[0:20:57-0:20:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:20:57):**  that allow local investors.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:20:59):**  So now we have a platform license, let's say in Oregon.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:21:02):**  And for me, that's just exciting of local capital with local farms at the actual local  
**[0:21:07-0:21:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:21:07):**  level of who buys from this farm, who's connected to them.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:21:10):**  I think that's the real power.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:21:12):**  So it's been years of us waiting through regulations and trying different methods and using, now  
**[0:21:17-0:21:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:21:17):**  we're using rules that are, you know, 200 years old on the books, but no one ever really  
**[0:21:21-0:21:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:21:21):**  thinks about them.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:21:22):**  And that's what we try to do.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:21:23):**  What are all the ways that we can bring in more investment for regenerative ag?  
**[0:21:28-0:21:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:21:28):**  Because we need everything, everything that's out there is a huge amount of capital needed  
**[0:21:32-0:21:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:21:32):**  to not only transition conventional to regenerative, but, but fund the regenerative farms already  
**[0:21:37-0:21:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:21:37):**  out there today.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:21:38):**  And that's an interesting point.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:21:40):**  How many of the projects that you've done or looked at, et cetera, are conventional  
**[0:21:46-0:21:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:21:46):**  to regenerative and how many have been, let's say regenerative from the start or regenerative,  
**[0:21:51-0:21:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:21:51):**  like, let's say relatively new farms that want to grow.  
**[0:21:54-0:21:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:21:54):**  Has there been something on the transition side of things, which I think is a huge opportunity,  
**[0:21:58-0:22:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:21:58):**  but also very difficult.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:22:00):**  The transition has picked up recently.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:22:02):**  So the beginning of Steward was purely regenerative focus.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:22:05):**  We're getting applications from farms who are already regenerative.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:22:08):**  The first 16 we funded all regenerative.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:22:11):**  We had over 2000 applications in the first year.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:22:13):**  So it's just kind of huge inflow of applicants.  
**[0:22:16-0:22:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:22:16):**  So the first focus was who's already farming today, doing important work, established products,  
**[0:22:21-0:22:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:22:21):**  established markets, and now they need growth capital to take the next step.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:22:25):**  That's where we started.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:22:26):**  And this could be the market gardens, the urban farms you mentioned, the processing  
**[0:22:29-0:22:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:22:29):**  units, the examples here you mentioned.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:22:32):**  Yeah.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:22:33):**  And so they already have their market built in and now they need to expand production.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:22:35):**  For me, that's a very simple economic proposition.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:22:38):**  The sales are there, they just need more production.  
**[0:22:40-0:22:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:22:40):**  And those are a lot of the farms are generally a few hundred acres or less.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:22:44):**  We've now had outreach from a lot more conventional farms.  
**[0:22:46-0:22:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:22:46):**  One that recently spoke to us in Minnesota.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:22:49):**  They inherited three brothers, the land from their father recently.  
**[0:22:52-0:22:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:22:52):**  They started the conversion to regenerative from conventional, but they need funding to  
**[0:22:57-0:22:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:22:57):**  fill that gap.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:22:58):**  And I think that's going to be a financial product that's very important to steward of.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:23:01):**  What's the transitional funding from conventional regenerative?  
**[0:23:05-0:23:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:23:05):**  It has to accrue.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:23:06):**  It has to be flexible while the yields switch.  
**[0:23:09-0:23:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:23:09):**  Also helping those farmers plan out instead of just doing traditional soil on a conversion,  
**[0:23:13-0:23:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:23:13):**  maybe let's look at some heritage grains.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:23:15):**  Let's see what's out there to really do a diverse mix instead of just a monoculture  
**[0:23:19-0:23:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:23:19):**  of organic, which I think happens too often.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:23:21):**  So I think that will be a big market for us.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:23:24):**  And when people look at regenerative ag, they think of it as a niche market, but it's really  
**[0:23:27-0:23:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:23:27):**  the other way around.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:23:29):**  That's how agriculture has been done forever, always in the history of the world, except  
**[0:23:33-0:23:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:23:33):**  for the past hundred years when we had fossil fuels and the kind of expansion of energy  
**[0:23:38-0:23:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:23:38):**  beyond the normal sources of it.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:23:40):**  So input heavy.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:23:42):**  Yes.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:23:43):**  So it's where most farming will be just based on resources and costs and use, let alone  
**[0:23:48-0:23:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:23:48):**  the kind of ecological impacts that are important to more and more people.  
**[0:23:52-0:24:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:23:52):**  And how much of your work then will be basically consulting or advising if you start advising  
**[0:24:00-0:24:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:24:00):**  on grain mixes, et cetera, it's very different from running a platform.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:24:04):**  Is that a risk?  
**[0:24:05-0:24:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:24:05):**  I mean, it's very interesting, obviously, but is that a risk from helping these three  
**[0:24:09-0:24:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:24:09):**  brothers and many others also making the farm transition, not just a financial transition?  
**[0:24:14-0:24:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:24:14):**  So we have a broad team, you know, with different skill sets.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:24:17):**  We have a team called farm stewards that are experienced farmers who help advise and support  
**[0:24:21-0:24:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:24:21):**  the farmers in our network.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:24:23):**  The head of that team lives in North Carolina.  
**[0:24:25-0:24:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:24:25):**  He's run a farm incubator for over 10 years.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:24:27):**  He spent many years supporting farmers in planning.  
**[0:24:31-0:24:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:24:31):**  And that's a service that we offer alongside.  
**[0:24:34-0:24:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:24:34):**  So people come to us in those conversations of what financing do you need is also where  
**[0:24:38-0:24:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:24:38):**  is your farm?  
**[0:24:39-0:24:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:24:39):**  What are the bottlenecks?  
**[0:24:40-0:24:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:24:40):**  What can we help and can we make some connections to local advisors?  
**[0:24:43-0:24:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:24:43):**  So that's kind of built in the steward platform.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:24:46):**  What's the network and infrastructure and expertise needed?  
**[0:24:50-0:24:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:24:50):**  So what started out as just a lending investment platform has very much brought into all types  
**[0:24:55-0:24:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:24:55):**  of services for farmers.  
**[0:24:56-0:25:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:24:56):**  We help farmers with direct to consumer sales for e-commerce.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:25:00):**  We help with bookkeeping.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:25:01):**  So we provide these services to take off their plate a lot of the work that they're supposed  
**[0:25:06-0:25:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:25:06):**  to do.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:25:07):**  And particularly for these smaller scale farms, they don't have different divisions and departments.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:25:11):**  They're very lean operations.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:25:13):**  And so they don't have time to do bookkeeping and grant writing and set up websites.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:25:17):**  And so we've realized that probably the primary value long term is going to be in the network  
**[0:25:22-0:25:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:25:22):**  and tech tools and infrastructure to help them support their businesses.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:25:26):**  And then the funding is fundamental to their growth.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:25:30):**  But the need for the regenerative farmers is broader than funding, although access to  
**[0:25:33-0:25:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:25:33):**  capital definitely is first on the list for most.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:25:36):**  And that turns into another business, basically, because you're not just providing the funding  
**[0:25:41-0:25:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:25:41):**  or the platform for funding and maybe access to funding, but you're also providing all  
**[0:25:45-0:25:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:25:45):**  of this potentially websites, bookkeeping, etc.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:25:50):**  That is a separate business, right?  
**[0:25:51-0:25:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:25:51):**  The Stewart Farm Services, if I'm correct.  
**[0:25:53-0:25:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:25:53):**  Yeah, a separate business, recurring revenue, kind of less risk.  
**[0:25:57-0:25:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:25:57):**  I personally, for me, the funding is core to both.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:25:59):**  A lot of businesses, once they build their platform, they add funding.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:26:02):**  You know, I know Square, for example, does that, right?  
**[0:26:05-0:26:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:26:05):**  They're supporting small merchants, they add funding.  
**[0:26:06-0:26:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:26:06):**  It's not, I mean, if you can have a look, I mean, there are privacy laws, obviously,  
**[0:26:10-0:26:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:26:10):**  but if you can see in the bookkeeping, who's doing well, just like banks do, very easy  
**[0:26:14-0:26:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:26:14):**  to monitor who's able to take on some funding.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:26:17):**  So that's what we've found.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:26:18):**  And how the bookkeeping helps you as an investor as well.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:26:20):**  That it all mixes the kind of core products we offer is access to capital, either the  
**[0:26:25-0:26:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:26:25):**  tool to raise it themselves or committed funding from us, then bookkeeping to manage the books  
**[0:26:30-0:26:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:26:30):**  and keep everything organized.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:26:31):**  And then e-commerce support to help with direct consumer sales, particularly since COVID,  
**[0:26:36-0:26:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:26:36):**  obviously, that's of critical importance to farmers.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:26:39):**  Let's talk about COVID.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:26:40):**  What have you seen?  
**[0:26:41-0:26:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:26:41):**  I saw you out there on a few interviews saying this is something along the lines, but correct  
**[0:26:46-0:26:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:26:46):**  me if I'm wrong, this is the moment for food systems.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:26:48):**  But what have you seen in the fields, actually?  
**[0:26:51-0:26:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:26:51):**  The farmers you work with, the farmers, how has it been?  
**[0:26:54-0:26:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:26:54):**  It's now May 2020, maybe people listen to this years now, but we're still many parts  
**[0:26:59-0:27:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:26:59):**  in lockdown.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:27:00):**  And it seems to be that local food systems are taking off.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:27:03):**  But what have you seen with the people you talk to, the investors, the farmers?  
**[0:27:07-0:27:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:27:07):**  What has it been like in the last few months?  
**[0:27:09-0:27:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:27:09):**  We built Steward from the ground up to support small to mid-sized regenerative farmers that  
**[0:27:14-0:27:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:27:14):**  used to be considered a niche market.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:27:16):**  Now it's the only profitable sector of all of agriculture.  
**[0:27:20-0:27:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:27:20):**  It's like those are the ones that have exploding demand.  
**[0:27:23-0:27:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:27:23):**  Customers who bought from them five years ago have been calling.  
**[0:27:26-0:27:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:27:26):**  They're all selling everything they have, you know, and even having to manage to limit  
**[0:27:30-0:27:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:27:30):**  sales because there's so much demand.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:27:32):**  So that the farmer that we generally support growing on the land, selling direct to consumer,  
**[0:27:37-0:27:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:27:37):**  their sales have just exploded.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:27:39):**  The challenge a lot of them have is the operational infrastructure to now manage a flood of retail  
**[0:27:44-0:27:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:27:44):**  orders.  
**[0:27:46-0:27:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:27:46):**  So that's where an e-commerce system, even if it's just for on-farm pickup, is very helpful  
**[0:27:50-0:27:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:27:50):**  and the tools to manage that.  
**[0:27:52-0:27:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:27:52):**  And then the funding is the thing that people forget where we just had a farm last week.  
**[0:27:56-0:28:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:27:56):**  They're shipping livestock and poultry to New York City from upstate New York.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:28:01):**  Their sales have just gone crazy, but now they need more freezer capacity.  
**[0:28:05-0:28:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:28:05):**  So now they need a few hundred thousand dollar investment to expand their freezer capacity,  
**[0:28:08-0:28:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:28:08):**  which they would share with other farms.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:28:10):**  So the sales growth that's taken off now, which is where all the attention is, is everyone's  
**[0:28:14-0:28:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:28:14):**  buying from these farms.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:28:15):**  It's fantastic.  
**[0:28:16-0:28:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:28:16):**  It's great.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:28:17):**  But then nobody's realizing, well, where's all the money going to be then to get that  
**[0:28:20-0:28:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:28:20):**  infrastructure to actually meet the demand that surged?  
**[0:28:24-0:28:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:28:24):**  And that I think Stewart's uniquely positioned for.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:28:27):**  And in general, that's where access to capital continues to cripple the movement.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:28:31):**  But for us, investors are more engaged than ever.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:28:34):**  There's more capital that wants to invest this than ever in the farms.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:28:37):**  And now we're actually working on some processing infrastructure like that, shared freezer capacity  
**[0:28:41-0:28:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:28:41):**  and value added processing.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:28:43):**  So I see it being the whole network needs that support and needs to be integrated.  
**[0:28:47-0:28:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:28:47):**  And when the dust settles a bit, I mean, nobody knows how long and what the new normal looks  
**[0:28:52-0:28:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:28:52):**  like.  
**[0:28:53-0:28:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:28:53):**  What is your idea there?  
**[0:28:54-0:28:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:28:54):**  Is everybody going to go back to buying chickens from the supermarket or absolutely not?  
**[0:28:59-0:29:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:28:59):**  Is this the watershed moment for the movement?  
**[0:29:01-0:29:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:29:01):**  What do you think?  
**[0:29:03-0:29:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:29:03):**  I think it is a fundamental shift.  
**[0:29:05-0:29:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:29:05):**  Obviously, the demand will drop back somewhat because you never keep 100 percent of new  
**[0:29:09-0:29:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:29:09):**  growth.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:29:10):**  But I think it's going to be on a new trend line.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:29:12):**  What happened in this moment was the farms had to streamline their enterprises.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:29:16):**  So the ones that really had a good direct to consumer system built a really efficient  
**[0:29:20-0:29:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:29:20):**  machine that was very easy for customers.  
**[0:29:22-0:29:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:29:22):**  And now for a customer, that experience of buying right from a farm is as easy as any  
**[0:29:26-0:29:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:29:26):**  other shopping experience that they have with a very different quality.  
**[0:29:30-0:29:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:29:30):**  Yes, much better quality.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:29:32):**  And that's the reality is if the best quality product doesn't ever make it to their grocery  
**[0:29:35-0:29:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:29:35):**  store because there's not that much of it and the margins the grocers and distributors  
**[0:29:39-0:29:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:29:39):**  take doesn't make any sense.  
**[0:29:40-0:29:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:29:40):**  So if you want the best product, you have to go right to the farm.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:29:43):**  And then for the farmer, direct sale is the best that they can get.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:29:46):**  So it's so aligned.  
**[0:29:47-0:29:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:29:47):**  And now with technology making it so easy, it's growing.  
**[0:29:50-0:29:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:29:50):**  But many farms that were just wholesale to restaurants now have to shift.  
**[0:29:54-0:29:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:29:54):**  That's a challenge.  
**[0:29:55-0:30:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:29:55):**  A lot of farms that are conventional and even large scale commodity, they're selling through  
**[0:30:00-0:30:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:30:00):**  tons of intermediaries.  
**[0:30:01-0:30:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:30:01):**  So one of the key things we advise on all farms is just like we're trying to get your  
**[0:30:04-0:30:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:30:04):**  capital direct to get the investors right to your farm, try to make all sales direct  
**[0:30:09-0:30:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:30:09):**  as much as possible.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:30:10):**  Remove the intermediary, take the margin yourself.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:30:13):**  And that's now what COVID created.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:30:16):**  That direct to consumer channel has exploded.  
**[0:30:18-0:30:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:30:18):**  So not all farms are grabbing it, but it's there.  
**[0:30:21-0:30:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:30:21):**  And I do think it's going to continue to grow.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:30:23):**  So our interest has skyrocketed.  
**[0:30:25-0:30:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:30:25):**  I think anybody who's farming on the ground, their interest has skyrocketed.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:30:29):**  They're nervous about when it ends.  
**[0:30:31-0:30:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:30:31):**  So they're waiting to invest until then, you know, this farm with the freezer capacity,  
**[0:30:35-0:30:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:30:35):**  they want to see six more months of this before they make that investment.  
**[0:30:40-0:30:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:30:40):**  But I believe that it's going to continue.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:30:42):**  And we've had farms say even if they had 10% of the demand, they would have full sales  
**[0:30:46-0:30:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:30:46):**  of everything.  
**[0:30:47-0:30:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:30:47):**  So it's far beyond the capacity for any of these producers to meet.  
**[0:30:52-0:30:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:30:52):**  And what is your biggest challenge now?  
**[0:30:54-0:30:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:30:54):**  But let's say I suppose COVID or after that, that settles, what's the biggest challenge  
**[0:30:59-0:31:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:30:59):**  for Stewart at the moment?  
**[0:31:01-0:31:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:31:01):**  So the hardest part with Stewart is the operational regulatory infrastructure around compliant  
**[0:31:08-0:31:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:31:08):**  securities offerings, making sure deals are vetted and underwritten, the whole framework  
**[0:31:12-0:31:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:31:12):**  around that.  
**[0:31:13-0:31:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:31:13):**  I mean, at Fundrise, we pioneered the idea of crowdfunding online and use regulations  
**[0:31:18-0:31:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:31:18):**  that were, you know, had been not been used in a long time to try to make that possible.  
**[0:31:22-0:31:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:31:22):**  Similarly with Stewart, we're trying to push forward of how do you bring more and more  
**[0:31:24-0:31:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:31:24):**  investors in at the right level, in the right structure to the farms.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:31:29):**  And that's been years in the making.  
**[0:31:30-0:31:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:31:30):**  And we now have that infrastructure set up.  
**[0:31:33-0:31:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:31:33):**  And so now it's really about bringing the capital online to support the farms and expanding  
**[0:31:37-0:31:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:31:37):**  it.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:31:38):**  So it's, we're in growth mode where if somebody comes to us ready to invest, they can pick  
**[0:31:42-0:31:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:31:42):**  among this whole network of farms.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:31:43):**  And as farms come to us, we can deliver value to them.  
**[0:31:47-0:31:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:31:47):**  But at the end of the day, the systems we've built are very niche and very complicated  
**[0:31:54-0:31:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:31:54):**  to do something simple.  
**[0:31:55-0:31:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:31:55):**  Like, how hard is it to have a local resident in Oregon invest in a farm in Oregon?  
**[0:31:59-0:32:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:31:59):**  It seems like it should be very simple, but that's not the norm.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:32:03):**  And in order to make that and facilitate that requires really nuanced technology and regulatory  
**[0:32:07-0:32:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:32:07):**  understanding.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:32:09):**  But that's my contribution to regenerative agriculture of really in-depth knowledge on  
**[0:32:13-0:32:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:32:13):**  financing and regulations and raising money online and everything that's needed to bring  
**[0:32:18-0:32:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:32:18):**  capital in because everybody's known for a long time access to capital is the problem.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:32:23):**  It's well understood.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:32:24):**  It's how do you then get the money to where it needs to go efficiently?  
**[0:32:28-0:32:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:32:28):**  How do you build a machine?  
**[0:32:30-0:32:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:32:30):**  Yeah.  
**[0:32:31-0:32:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:32:31):**  And without just start funding a hundred thousand acre farms, which is all that exists historically  
**[0:32:34-0:32:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:32:34):**  in regenerative ag of big pension funds, family offices, owning thousand acre tracts of land  
**[0:32:40-0:32:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:32:40):**  plus, but the reality is most of the market is let's say 5,000 acres and below.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:32:45):**  So most of the market is not where the first wave of large scale money is.  
**[0:32:50-0:32:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:32:50):**  We need to kind of back to the crowdfunding, get many people involved, even people writing  
**[0:32:55-0:32:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:32:55):**  50K checks, a hundred K checks, that's still crowdfunding.  
**[0:32:57-0:33:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:32:57):**  It's not, it's after we'd small it's unable to access it easily.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:33:00):**  And is it broadly available at ease and that that system mixed with actually understanding  
**[0:33:06-0:33:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:33:06):**  the farms is a lot to get streamlined.  
**[0:33:08-0:33:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:33:08):**  Yeah, I know.  
**[0:33:09-0:33:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:33:09):**  I know some examples in the renewable energy space, which I know the it's, I wouldn't say  
**[0:33:16-0:33:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:33:16):**  equally challenging.  
**[0:33:17-0:33:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:33:17):**  It's very tricky, obviously to do.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:33:19):**  But at least there you have, you're not dealing with a life system.  
**[0:33:23-0:33:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:33:23):**  You're dealing with solar panels, wind turbines, and that's pretty much it.  
**[0:33:25-0:33:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:33:25):**  And that's already very, very complicated.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:33:27):**  Imagine if you bring that whole crowd piece and all the regulation to the agriculture  
**[0:33:31-0:33:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:33:31):**  space where everything is moving and everything is alive and yeah, I can imagine.  
**[0:33:35-0:33:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:33:35):**  So can you give us a lay of the land where now in May, 2020, how long has Stewart been  
**[0:33:42-0:33:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:33:42):**  around?  
**[0:33:43-0:33:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:33:43):**  How many people are you?  
**[0:33:44-0:33:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:33:44):**  How many farms did you fund it?  
**[0:33:45-0:33:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:33:45):**  And how much money has come through the pipes basically of the system just to have a bit  
**[0:33:49-0:33:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:33:49):**  of an understanding where you're at.  
**[0:33:51-0:33:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:33:51):**  I started working on Stewart in 2016, just researching, learning, meeting with farmers.  
**[0:33:56-0:33:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:33:56):**  When we launched the podcast.  
**[0:33:57-0:33:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:33:57):**  Yeah, right around that.  
**[0:33:58-0:34:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:33:58):**  I know that was early days I started to meet these farmers.  
**[0:34:01-0:34:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:34:01):**  But the idea of what can these farmers, what do they need?  
**[0:34:05-0:34:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:34:05):**  What can they afford to pay?  
**[0:34:06-0:34:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:34:06):**  How are their businesses run?  
**[0:34:07-0:34:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:34:07):**  Can they be successful?  
**[0:34:08-0:34:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:34:08):**  You hear all the time, small farms are struggling.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:34:11):**  Are they viable enterprises?  
**[0:34:13-0:34:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:34:13):**  So that was a long discovery phase for me.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:34:15):**  The first farms we funded were two in 2017 in the summer.  
**[0:34:19-0:34:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:34:19):**  That was us really doing our test case of getting the structure in place, getting the  
**[0:34:22-0:34:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:34:22):**  investment vehicle up.  
**[0:34:24-0:34:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:34:24):**  Those were loans that I personally funded to really understand how are they going to  
**[0:34:28-0:34:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:34:28):**  perform?  
**[0:34:29-0:34:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:34:29):**  How is it going to work?  
**[0:34:30-0:34:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:34:30):**  Then 2018, we brought in the pilot and we funded 10 farms across the country, Oregon,  
**[0:34:35-0:34:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:34:35):**  Louisiana, Pennsylvania, livestock, fruit, vegetable, winemaker, everything.  
**[0:34:40-0:34:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:34:40):**  One in Europe, which was a winemaker in Switzerland, natural wines up in the Alps.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:34:44):**  So really saw the reach of this isn't limited to certain parts of the world.  
**[0:34:48-0:34:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:34:48):**  This is an issue everywhere.  
**[0:34:50-0:34:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:34:50):**  These farmers are working all over the country and the US and all over the world, but access  
**[0:34:55-0:34:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:34:55):**  to capital is an issue for all of them.  
**[0:34:57-0:35:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:34:57):**  Then last year we launched the first investment products so that people can come to the website,  
**[0:35:02-0:35:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:35:02):**  invest in the projects on the website.  
**[0:35:04-0:35:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:35:04):**  We have over $3 million invested through that product.  
**[0:35:07-0:35:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:35:07):**  And then each day we're adding new farms.  
**[0:35:08-0:35:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:35:08):**  So we have over 20 farms that have been funded.  
**[0:35:11-0:35:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:35:11):**  We have over 2,000 that have applied that we're now bringing through our services platform.  
**[0:35:16-0:35:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:35:16):**  We have another 50 plus that are using different services from bookkeeping, e-commerce to all  
**[0:35:21-0:35:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:35:21):**  the different backend services.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:35:22):**  So what the past year has been of discovering regenerative agriculture, doing a few transactions  
**[0:35:28-0:35:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:35:28):**  to really figure things out, just getting a flood of demand from applicants and realizing  
**[0:35:33-0:35:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:35:33):**  that there's huge scale and opportunity here, and then building the systems to bring those  
**[0:35:38-0:35:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:35:38):**  in, broaden our offering from just funding to support across the entire enterprise, and  
**[0:35:44-0:35:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:35:44):**  then weaving through the regulations now to open up more types of investment.  
**[0:35:48-0:35:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:35:48):**  So it feels like all of that groundwork and preparation was done now for this moment of  
**[0:35:54-0:35:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:35:54):**  the attention now being on the sector and people wanting to easily figure out if I want  
**[0:35:58-0:36:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:35:58):**  to invest in regenerative agriculture, how do I do it?  
**[0:36:00-0:36:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:36:00):**  And we've spent years and time and capital and effort of putting the systems in place  
**[0:36:05-0:36:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:36:05):**  to make that seamless.  
**[0:36:07-0:36:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:36:07):**  And it's a question I don't always ask, I think, but how involved are farmers in Steward?  
**[0:36:12-0:36:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:36:12):**  I had a discussion with an ag tech or somebody is looking at a lot of ag tech companies recently.  
**[0:36:18-0:36:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:36:18):**  And she mentioned very often the last time they talked to a farmer was a very long time  
**[0:36:23-0:36:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:36:23):**  ago, meaning they build something for a lot of money and probably doesn't connect to farmers.  
**[0:36:28-0:36:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:36:28):**  Like there should be a farmer on board of any company, honestly, or somewhere very much  
**[0:36:32-0:36:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:36:32):**  involved part of the company.  
**[0:36:33-0:36:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:36:33):**  We had a discussion with a soy sauce brewer that actually have their farmer that makes  
**[0:36:38-0:36:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:36:38):**  the soy for the soy sauce is part of the company, etc, etc.  
**[0:36:41-0:36:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:36:41):**  So how involved I'm setting up the question very badly, but how involved are farmers in  
**[0:36:46-0:36:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:36:46):**  Steward in terms of the team in terms of advisory board, etc?  
**[0:36:50-0:36:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:36:50):**  Yeah, we're very connected with the farmers.  
**[0:36:52-0:36:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:36:52):**  We're always communicating with them regularly, even through text message and, you know, very  
**[0:36:57-0:36:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:36:57):**  close relationships.  
**[0:36:58-0:36:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:36:58):**  We have a farmer on our team.  
**[0:36:59-0:37:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:36:59):**  His name's Aaron Newton.  
**[0:37:00-0:37:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:37:00):**  He's the one I mentioned who leads the farm steward team.  
**[0:37:03-0:37:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:37:03):**  So he personally has 20 years experience farming, running a farm incubator for over 10.  
**[0:37:09-0:37:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:37:09):**  And he works with the farmers as they come through and has a phone call and helps advise  
**[0:37:13-0:37:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:37:13):**  them.  
**[0:37:14-0:37:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:37:14):**  And he has a network of experienced farmers that have worked with other farm incubators  
**[0:37:18-0:37:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:37:18):**  that he's met around the world that support these farms.  
**[0:37:21-0:37:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:37:21):**  So we're very agricultural focused.  
**[0:37:23-0:37:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:37:23):**  I don't even like thinking of us as ag tech because I find so much of ag tech is let's  
**[0:37:27-0:37:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:37:27):**  do really advanced technology solutions for the mega farms, you know, spectral imaging  
**[0:37:31-0:37:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:37:31):**  and drones and automated everything.  
**[0:37:34-0:37:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:37:34):**  Digitalize everything.  
**[0:37:35-0:37:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:37:35):**  Yeah.  
**[0:37:36-0:37:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:37:36):**  And get rid of the people for sure.  
**[0:37:38-0:37:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:37:38):**  That's always the focus.  
**[0:37:39-0:37:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:37:39):**  Of course, robots would be the solution.  
**[0:37:41-0:37:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:37:41):**  Whereas why don't we just have simple tools for the farmers, like just get them with the  
**[0:37:45-0:37:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:37:45):**  basic elements that they need.  
**[0:37:48-0:37:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:37:48):**  And so for us, it's providing those tools, software they can use, help with bookkeeping,  
**[0:37:52-0:37:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:37:52):**  but it's more of how can we take this out of your hands so you can just focus on the  
**[0:37:56-0:37:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:37:56):**  farming and some of these back end elements are saved.  
**[0:37:59-0:38:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:37:59):**  So we try to be very easy to interface with the farm.  
**[0:38:02-0:38:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:38:02):**  We have farmers on our team.  
**[0:38:04-0:38:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:38:04):**  We care deeply about them and we're in discussions with them regularly.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:38:07):**  I'm actually speaking to a farmer tomorrow who's the cheese maker in Southern Oregon  
**[0:38:11-0:38:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:38:11):**  who are helping get financing to buy their land.  
**[0:38:14-0:38:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:38:14):**  And you know, we talk every few months and there's definitely a close relationship and  
**[0:38:18-0:38:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:38:18):**  I visited them a few times.  
**[0:38:19-0:38:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:38:19):**  So my passion comes from that of meeting the farmer where they are and supporting them  
**[0:38:26-0:38:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:38:26):**  in the way that fits them as opposed to here's some advanced solution we want and we just  
**[0:38:31-0:38:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:38:31):**  want to scale it and every farm's a number and let's just get a hundred thousand farms.  
**[0:38:35-0:38:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:38:35):**  It's really unique to that farm and that's regenerative agriculture that each farmer  
**[0:38:39-0:38:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:38:39):**  is different in how they approach it and their background and what they want to do.  
**[0:38:43-0:38:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:38:43):**  And in terms of let's switch a bit to the investor side, you mentioned it's accessible  
**[0:38:49-0:38:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:38:49):**  and obviously this is not investment advice, but it's accessible for anybody living in  
**[0:38:54-0:38:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:38:54):**  the US.  
**[0:38:55-0:38:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:38:55):**  It does also mean for the Swiss farm, the winemaker you mentioned, was it financed from  
**[0:38:59-0:39:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:38:59):**  the US?  
**[0:39:00-0:39:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:39:00):**  How is this in terms of accessibility at the moment, which can obviously change, but just  
**[0:39:05-0:39:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:39:05):**  to give people an idea who can access the platform from the investor side?  
**[0:39:10-0:39:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:39:10):**  We try to be as broad as possible and that's our experience in these rules and regulations.  
**[0:39:14-0:39:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:39:14):**  So we can have investors from anywhere in the world as long as they're accredited and  
**[0:39:20-0:39:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:39:20):**  we have a process where they can submit those materials.  
**[0:39:22-0:39:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:39:22):**  So that allows investors from all around the world to invest in these farms.  
**[0:39:26-0:39:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:39:26):**  We then also try to allow as much local investment as possible.  
**[0:39:29-0:39:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:39:29):**  So for US based investors, any of them can invest in the main project.  
**[0:39:34-0:39:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:39:34):**  And then you mentioned the Swiss winemaker, the Oregon farm, then at the regional level,  
**[0:39:38-0:39:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:39:38):**  the kind of state level, we try to figure out what are rules there to allow local investment.  
**[0:39:43-0:39:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:39:43):**  But that's at a, you know, that there's the hardest ones to comply with because it's country  
**[0:39:47-0:39:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:39:47):**  by country and farm by farm.  
**[0:39:49-0:39:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:39:49):**  So we have a broad layer of the family office, high net worth investor, who's really anchoring  
**[0:39:54-0:39:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:39:54):**  a lot of these investments and then try to open that up to individuals at a few thousand  
**[0:39:59-0:40:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:39:59):**  dollars in lesser amounts.  
**[0:40:01-0:40:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:40:01):**  So it's the pairing of all types of funding that's really needed and the way that the  
**[0:40:05-0:40:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:40:05):**  general framework for securities law is written around the world is if you're high net worth,  
**[0:40:09-0:40:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:40:09):**  you're exempt from most of the rules and you can invest in any deal.  
**[0:40:12-0:40:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:40:12):**  And if you're not, that's when get things that complicated.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:40:14):**  So we're built to open it up to anybody and we adapt and figure out how to use all those  
**[0:40:19-0:40:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:40:19):**  rules as possible.  
**[0:40:21-0:40:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:40:21):**  There's always some gaps, but at the end of the day, it's bringing and opening it up to  
**[0:40:24-0:40:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:40:24):**  as many people as possible.  
**[0:40:26-0:40:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:40:26):**  And in terms of you've done the Swiss farm, I don't want to keep coming back to that one,  
**[0:40:30-0:40:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:40:30):**  but what are your plans internationally beyond the US?  
**[0:40:34-0:40:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:40:34):**  So we had a huge amount of outreach from farms all across the world.  
**[0:40:38-0:40:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:40:38):**  Canada, New Zealand and Australia have been particularly big.  
**[0:40:41-0:40:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:40:41):**  Those, we have farms that are already in our queue, I actually just spoke with a oyster  
**[0:40:46-0:40:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:40:46):**  farm in New South Wales, about four hours south of Sydney.  
**[0:40:50-0:40:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:40:50):**  He already has raised money for his oyster farm through his local network.  
**[0:40:55-0:41:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:40:55):**  So now he can use our software tool to broaden that and have that offering online where he  
**[0:41:00-0:41:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:41:00):**  can then share it to his email list and those people can invest.  
**[0:41:03-0:41:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:41:03):**  So he's now able to use our technology without us writing the check, but use the system for  
**[0:41:09-0:41:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:41:09):**  his network in Australia.  
**[0:41:10-0:41:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:41:10):**  And that's really where I'm seeing the growth now in Steward of here's the tool that allows  
**[0:41:14-0:41:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:41:14):**  you to tap into these investors easily and here's how you can use it compliantly.  
**[0:41:19-0:41:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:41:19):**  And we have such a broader reach at that point because I may personally underwriting that  
**[0:41:23-0:41:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:41:23):**  deal in Australia is going to be tough and we're going to build local resources over  
**[0:41:27-0:41:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:41:27):**  time to do deals from our balance sheet in those markets and others.  
**[0:41:31-0:41:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:41:31):**  But if there's a great farmer on the ground who has a network and access to potential  
**[0:41:34-0:41:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:41:34):**  investors, why not give them a tool to facilitate it and build them into the network?  
**[0:41:38-0:41:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:41:38):**  So as we've gone from direct lending and direct investment to tools, whether that's a bookkeeping  
**[0:41:44-0:41:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:41:44):**  or e-commerce or fundraising tool, that's really allowed us to support the international  
**[0:41:50-0:41:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:41:50):**  market.  
**[0:41:51-0:41:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:41:51):**  For me, there is no geographic boundary to this work is demand for it and a need for  
**[0:41:55-0:41:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:41:55):**  it everywhere.  
**[0:41:56-0:42:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:41:56):**  So it's just a matter of balancing what can you support and then what's the operational  
**[0:42:01-0:42:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:42:01):**  infrastructure to do that.  
**[0:42:02-0:42:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:42:02):**  And that means that let's say in Australia there wasn't or isn't a platform that is able  
**[0:42:07-0:42:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:42:07):**  to do it.  
**[0:42:08-0:42:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:42:08):**  And for this farmer, it makes more sense to license basically to take the steward platform  
**[0:42:12-0:42:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:42:12):**  than to find a local, some kind of local solution to handle the investors that he has already.  
**[0:42:18-0:42:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:42:18):**  So he had created a profile on the steward platform and he sets up his offering and he  
**[0:42:23-0:42:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:42:23):**  shares with his investor.  
**[0:42:25-0:42:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:42:25):**  We don't take a percent of fee, we just charge a monthly SaaS fee.  
**[0:42:27-0:42:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:42:27):**  So it's effectively software as a service.  
**[0:42:30-0:42:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:42:30):**  So the reality is the work we're doing around fundraising is very advanced.  
**[0:42:34-0:42:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:42:34):**  Like I've done this for 10 years in two companies of how do you really open up investment, but  
**[0:42:40-0:42:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:42:40):**  make it simple compliance.  
**[0:42:41-0:42:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:42:41):**  So  
**[0:42:42-0:42:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:42:42):**  And that compliant part is the same in Australia, would be the same in Italy or  
**[0:42:46-0:42:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:42:46):**  Depends on the country.  
**[0:42:47-0:42:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:42:47):**  So that's something that could be limiting country by country.  
**[0:42:51-0:42:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:42:51):**  That is part of a limiting factor.  
**[0:42:53-0:42:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:42:53):**  And you find out, you know, what are the rules?  
**[0:42:55-0:42:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:42:55):**  Generally there's a similar carve out where the higher level investors can easily invest.  
**[0:42:59-0:43:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:42:59):**  And if you want small local, you have to do some more filings and we can assist with that.  
**[0:43:03-0:43:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:43:03):**  But I think the other focus is we're just committed to sustainable agriculture.  
**[0:43:08-0:43:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:43:08):**  And so there's an alignment with these farmers.  
**[0:43:10-0:43:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:43:10):**  They come to us, we care about the work they're doing.  
**[0:43:13-0:43:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:43:13):**  You're not doing any other type of farmers.  
**[0:43:15-0:43:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:43:15):**  We understand their business, no other type of farmer.  
**[0:43:19-0:43:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:43:19):**  We know about, okay, you need this for working capital.  
**[0:43:21-0:43:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:43:21):**  How about this?  
**[0:43:22-0:43:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:43:22):**  How about that?  
**[0:43:23-0:43:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:43:23):**  Or if you're looking to buy land, this is an option, that's an option.  
**[0:43:25-0:43:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:43:25):**  So the fact that that's all we do only for generative agriculture, which, you know,  
**[0:43:31-0:43:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:43:31):**  I probably have a nice network of alumni farmers or farmers that are still being, still financed,  
**[0:43:38-0:43:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:43:38):**  et cetera.  
**[0:43:39-0:43:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:43:39):**  That connection between them globally is very interesting.  
**[0:43:43-0:43:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:43:43):**  And that's already been building.  
**[0:43:44-0:43:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:43:44):**  And I just connected that urban farm in Detroit with an urban farm in Washington, DC that  
**[0:43:48-0:43:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:43:48):**  applied to us.  
**[0:43:49-0:43:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:43:49):**  So we're already seeing that network effect.  
**[0:43:50-0:43:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:43:50):**  So that's been a shift from us as kind of investor lender to us as platform, because  
**[0:43:56-0:43:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:43:56):**  the scale of the market is so huge.  
**[0:43:58-0:44:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:43:58):**  There's so many of these farmers out there that need resources and support.  
**[0:44:02-0:44:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:44:02):**  So let's bring all of them on.  
**[0:44:03-0:44:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:44:03):**  Do you have any idea about the size, even just the US, because for sure you have better  
**[0:44:08-0:44:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:44:08):**  numbers, like to give us an idea of how many could even be eligible or interesting from  
**[0:44:14-0:44:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:44:14):**  an investor perspective, let's give it, any idea of the market?  
**[0:44:18-0:44:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:44:18):**  It's completely underestimated.  
**[0:44:19-0:44:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:44:19):**  And it bothers me in the classic way where the USDA has so many studies on conventional  
**[0:44:23-0:44:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:44:23):**  ag on everything, the exact amount of bushels of corn per acre in this county, like everything.  
**[0:44:28-0:44:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:44:28):**  And in the second you talk about, well, focus on sustainable ag and these smaller farms,  
**[0:44:34-0:44:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:44:34):**  nothing.  
**[0:44:35-0:44:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:44:35):**  They're like, that's the other category.  
**[0:44:36-0:44:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:44:36):**  So there really is not reliable data.  
**[0:44:38-0:44:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:44:38):**  I think the data is way underestimating.  
**[0:44:41-0:44:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:44:41):**  We see farmers all around the country, all different backgrounds in regions that you  
**[0:44:45-0:44:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:44:45):**  would definitely not consider rural Louisiana, places that aren't where you envision this  
**[0:44:51-0:44:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:44:51):**  type of agriculture.  
**[0:44:52-0:44:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:44:52):**  And then we started marketing around the world, Mexico, for example, and got hundreds of applicants  
**[0:44:57-0:44:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:44:57):**  overnight.  
**[0:44:58-0:45:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:44:58):**  In the US we estimate there's 2 million, it's a fact that there's 2 million small to mid-sized  
**[0:45:03-0:45:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:45:03):**  farms.  
**[0:45:04-0:45:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:45:04):**  We put 25% as who today meets those parameters.  
**[0:45:07-0:45:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:45:07):**  So that's half a million.  
**[0:45:08-0:45:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:45:08):**  But the market of smaller farms is growing for the first time in a hundred years.  
**[0:45:12-0:45:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:45:12):**  So that's an increase.  
**[0:45:13-0:45:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:45:13):**  And the share of farmers that are being sustainable regenerative, conventional over is growing.  
**[0:45:19-0:45:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:45:19):**  So it's like you're in the part of the market with the base number growing and the ratio  
**[0:45:23-0:45:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:45:23):**  growing.  
**[0:45:24-0:45:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:45:24):**  So I'm a huge believer, but part of my discovery experience with Steward was that of like,  
**[0:45:29-0:45:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:45:29):**  well, what really is the scale of this market and how do you reach them easily?  
**[0:45:34-0:45:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:45:34):**  And we found through digital ads and through network effects and through referrals, they're  
**[0:45:38-0:45:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:45:38):**  all out there and they all have similar problems and they're looking for support and it's generally  
**[0:45:43-0:45:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:45:43):**  pretty hard to come by.  
**[0:45:45-0:45:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:45:45):**  Oh, very, very interesting.  
**[0:45:47-0:45:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:45:47):**  And just to shift gears a bit, what I always like to ask, obviously, again, not giving  
**[0:45:51-0:45:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:45:51):**  investment advice, but if you would imagine there's a theater full of smart investors,  
**[0:45:56-0:45:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:45:56):**  smart impact investors, they are convinced about soil.  
**[0:45:58-0:46:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:45:58):**  They read the books, they visited some farms.  
**[0:46:02-0:46:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:46:02):**  What would you give them as guidance?  
**[0:46:05-0:46:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:46:05):**  What kind of questions should they ask before they make their first investment in the regenerative  
**[0:46:09-0:46:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:46:09):**  food and egg space?  
**[0:46:10-0:46:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:46:10):**  What should they look out for?  
**[0:46:11-0:46:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:46:11):**  What are things you definitely put in their backpack as they go out and explore that investment  
**[0:46:16-0:46:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:46:16):**  side?  
**[0:46:17-0:46:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:46:17):**  I always think they should start of what means the most to them.  
**[0:46:19-0:46:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:46:19):**  So is it a certain region that matters maybe where they grew up or they have a connection  
**[0:46:23-0:46:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:46:23):**  to, they want to support farmers there, or is there a product type where they are obsessed,  
**[0:46:27-0:46:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:46:27):**  let's say with cheese and they want to support a cheese maker?  
**[0:46:29-0:46:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:46:29):**  I hear something about that.  
**[0:46:30-0:46:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:46:30):**  The second time you bring up cheese, that's interesting.  
**[0:46:34-0:46:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:46:34):**  I mean, definitely, I'm for sure.  
**[0:46:36-0:46:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:46:36):**  It's you know, they enjoy the products is one of the best parts.  
**[0:46:39-0:46:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:46:39):**  So I think of it as you're building a close relationship with the farmer by investing  
**[0:46:44-0:46:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:46:44):**  in them.  
**[0:46:45-0:46:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:46:45):**  You can invest in a lot of fun, but you can also invest directly in a farmer.  
**[0:46:47-0:46:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:46:47):**  I think the more engaged you are, let me speak to the farmer, let me understand them and  
**[0:46:51-0:46:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:46:51):**  how I'm helping them and what is important to them.  
**[0:46:54-0:46:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:46:54):**  I always think that's a good place to start.  
**[0:46:56-0:46:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:46:56):**  We have all types of investors.  
**[0:46:58-0:47:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:46:58):**  We have individuals that are obsessed with the farms and want to visit them and want  
**[0:47:01-0:47:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:47:01):**  to talk to them and want to volunteer and help with harvest and do everything.  
**[0:47:05-0:47:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:47:05):**  And then we have the more classic family office where they have a mandate and they want to  
**[0:47:09-0:47:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:47:09):**  do more sustainable investing and they're kind of allocating and they want to put 5  
**[0:47:14-0:47:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:47:14):**  million spread across this many deals.  
**[0:47:15-0:47:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:47:15):**  And those can be done too.  
**[0:47:16-0:47:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:47:16):**  You know, here's the portfolio, these are the different transactions.  
**[0:47:19-0:47:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:47:19):**  They're all secured mortgages between 8 and 10 percent.  
**[0:47:22-0:47:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:47:22):**  You know, if you want tax free, you can do this.  
**[0:47:24-0:47:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:47:24):**  So they're very different conversations.  
**[0:47:26-0:47:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:47:26):**  But the first group where they are passionate about this work and they want to see it happen,  
**[0:47:31-0:47:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:47:31):**  I think the more they can be connected to the things they're investing in and feel that  
**[0:47:35-0:47:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:47:35):**  connection and understand it, the easier it is for them to take that first step because  
**[0:47:40-0:47:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:47:40):**  it's a very non-traditional investment.  
**[0:47:42-0:47:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:47:42):**  And if they're just wanting it to look like a classic commercial real estate investment,  
**[0:47:46-0:47:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:47:46):**  it is a little bit different.  
**[0:47:48-0:47:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:47:48):**  It still is real estate.  
**[0:47:49-0:47:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:47:49):**  It still fits those characteristics.  
**[0:47:50-0:47:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:47:50):**  But you have an operating business that's dealing with nature and land on top of it.  
**[0:47:55-0:47:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:47:55):**  So I think that that personal connection is a driver.  
**[0:47:58-0:48:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:47:58):**  And we find that all the time that one of the larger investors in the deal may have  
**[0:48:01-0:48:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:48:01):**  grown up nearby that farm or they used to farm at one point and they want to support  
**[0:48:05-0:48:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:48:05):**  it.  
**[0:48:06-0:48:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:48:06):**  It's a lot of successful entrepreneurs who've made their money and now want to reinvest  
**[0:48:09-0:48:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:48:09):**  and have that have a positive impact.  
**[0:48:12-0:48:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:48:12):**  So I'm hearing from those investors all the time.  
**[0:48:16-0:48:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:48:16):**  But I think to get over the hump, the more they can feel a personal connection with that  
**[0:48:19-0:48:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:48:19):**  farmer, that project, the more likely they are to do it.  
**[0:48:22-0:48:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:48:22):**  Especially the first ones.  
**[0:48:24-0:48:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:48:24):**  It's probably the advice I give the most.  
**[0:48:26-0:48:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:48:26):**  Go and talk to farmers.  
**[0:48:28-0:48:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:48:28):**  Go and spend time on farms.  
**[0:48:30-0:48:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:48:30):**  I know.  
**[0:48:31-0:48:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:48:31):**  Actually, go visit them.  
**[0:48:32-0:48:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:48:32):**  I know.  
**[0:48:33-0:48:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:48:33):**  Go visit.  
**[0:48:34-0:48:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:48:34):**  You will learn a lot.  
**[0:48:35-0:48:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:48:35):**  And it's not so easy.  
**[0:48:36-0:48:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:48:36):**  And it's actually not so complicated.  
**[0:48:38-0:48:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:48:38):**  It's very complex.  
**[0:48:39-0:48:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:48:39):**  But go and talk, spend time, listen.  
**[0:48:41-0:48:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:48:41):**  And especially if you didn't grow up on a farm, especially if you haven't been on regenerative  
**[0:48:45-0:48:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:48:45):**  farms recently, you'll be in for a few surprises, which is good.  
**[0:48:50-0:48:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:48:50):**  A good surprise is not bad ones.  
**[0:48:51-0:48:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:48:51):**  But go and talk and learn.  
**[0:48:53-0:48:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:48:53):**  Go and ask questions because there's a lot to discover there and you will find ways to  
**[0:48:57-0:48:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:48:57):**  put money to work.  
**[0:48:58-0:48:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:48:58):**  I completely agree.  
**[0:48:59-0:49:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:48:59):**  So visit the farm.  
**[0:49:00-0:49:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:49:00):**  And that's what we really try to do at Steward of how do we engage those customers who care  
**[0:49:05-0:49:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:49:05):**  about the farm?  
**[0:49:06-0:49:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:49:06):**  They may see the farm, the farmers market.  
**[0:49:08-0:49:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:49:08):**  How do they get further putting capital at the farms?  
**[0:49:10-0:49:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:49:10):**  A lot of them are building homes to stay out on the farms for rental.  
**[0:49:14-0:49:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:49:14):**  How do we engage people in the world of agriculture?  
**[0:49:17-0:49:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:49:17):**  Because that's been the big problem.  
**[0:49:19-0:49:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:49:19):**  In the US's 1890s, half the population was in agriculture.  
**[0:49:22-0:49:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:49:22):**  Now it's 2%.  
**[0:49:24-0:49:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:49:24):**  So we've just pushed everybody off the farm.  
**[0:49:26-0:49:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:49:26):**  And 2% doesn't work very well.  
**[0:49:28-0:49:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:49:28):**  Obviously, removing all the farmers and scaling the farms has a lot of external consequences.  
**[0:49:33-0:49:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:49:33):**  So now we need to think about how are we going to get those millions or hundreds of millions  
**[0:49:37-0:49:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:49:37):**  across the world back into this?  
**[0:49:39-0:49:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:49:39):**  They're not all going to be farmers, but they have a role.  
**[0:49:41-0:49:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:49:41):**  They can use their capital, they can use their purchasing power, they can use their expertise.  
**[0:49:46-0:49:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:49:46):**  Whatever it takes, they need to put their resources, even if it's not just capital,  
**[0:49:49-0:49:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:49:49):**  but any resource they have towards these farmers because they're facing a lot of challenges  
**[0:49:54-0:49:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:49:54):**  and the work they do is very important.  
**[0:49:55-0:49:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:49:55):**  Without that support, they have trouble.  
**[0:49:57-0:49:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:49:57):**  And very lonely.  
**[0:49:59-0:50:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:49:59):**  I think that's something we in the city underestimate.  
**[0:50:03-0:50:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:50:03):**  And I think we're being pushed to acknowledge that we're in this crisis and many other crises  
**[0:50:08-0:50:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:50:08):**  are extremely disconnected from nature.  
**[0:50:11-0:50:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:50:11):**  And one of the best ways probably to get back into that is not only go out in nature, which  
**[0:50:18-0:50:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:50:18):**  on regenerative farms is everywhere, but experience that.  
**[0:50:21-0:50:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:50:21):**  And the best way I think to reconnect is through food, through agriculture and discover that  
**[0:50:26-0:50:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:50:26):**  connection.  
**[0:50:27-0:50:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:50:27):**  And it can be through your purchasing, can be through your visiting in terms of tourism  
**[0:50:30-0:50:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:50:30):**  and can be through your investment dollars or euros or yen or whatever you're investing.  
**[0:50:35-0:50:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:50:35):**  Yeah.  
**[0:50:36-0:50:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:50:36):**  And that's where my connection began to from the restaurant side of seeing chefs and working  
**[0:50:40-0:50:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:50:40):**  with chefs who had huge demand for their products, were very passionate about what they were  
**[0:50:43-0:50:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:50:43):**  buying.  
**[0:50:44-0:50:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:50:44):**  So I think that's how the movement really translates from purchasing dollars to investment  
**[0:50:49-0:50:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:50:49):**  dollars is people who are connected through food.  
**[0:50:52-0:50:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:50:52):**  Chefs are the ones with the pedestal to actually draw attention and converting those customers  
**[0:50:57-0:50:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:50:57):**  is the first step.  
**[0:50:59-0:51:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:50:59):**  And that's often the conversation from the investors, you talk about food a lot, because  
**[0:51:03-0:51:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:51:03):**  that's what matters to them.  
**[0:51:04-0:51:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:51:04):**  Or that's the experience.  
**[0:51:05-0:51:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:51:05):**  It's easy.  
**[0:51:06-0:51:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:51:06):**  And wine, the Swiss winemaker too, that he sells natural wines hand harvested up in the  
**[0:51:11-0:51:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:51:11):**  Alps, you know, 1000 metres.  
**[0:51:13-0:51:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:51:13):**  That's just a product that people are connected to.  
**[0:51:15-0:51:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:51:15):**  It's not difficult to have people feel like...  
**[0:51:18-0:51:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:51:18):**  I see the combination really.  
**[0:51:20-0:51:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:51:20):**  It's a good portfolio.  
**[0:51:21-0:51:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:51:21):**  Oysters and wine and...  
**[0:51:23-0:51:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:51:23):**  No, no, it is.  
**[0:51:24-0:51:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:51:24):**  It's more sexy than a wind turbine, which I'm actually staring at, honestly, outside  
**[0:51:29-0:51:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:51:29):**  this window.  
**[0:51:30-0:51:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:51:30):**  But it's definitely something people connect much more to than the electricity coming out  
**[0:51:35-0:51:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:51:35):**  of their grid, which is fundamental.  
**[0:51:37-0:51:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:51:37):**  And we definitely have to decarbonise.  
**[0:51:39-0:51:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:51:39):**  It's one of the reasons I'm recording the podcast.  
**[0:51:41-0:51:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:51:41):**  I saw with investors, the interest, if you ask them on surveys, the interest, we asked  
**[0:51:45-0:51:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:51:45):**  them at Tonic, in food and egg was always very high.  
**[0:51:48-0:51:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:51:48):**  But if you look at their portfolios, they invested mostly in renewable energy and other  
**[0:51:53-0:51:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:51:53):**  sectors and food and egg was always very, very small.  
**[0:51:56-0:52:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:51:56):**  And I didn't understand because I saw these people building very interesting things and  
**[0:52:00-0:52:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:52:00):**  like, how come that it's not part of more portfolios?  
**[0:52:03-0:52:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:52:03):**  Because it's not that easy.  
**[0:52:04-0:52:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:52:04):**  I mean, their structures and infrastructure is needed to do it.  
**[0:52:06-0:52:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:52:06):**  And finally, now, years later, we're seeing more of their structures being built.  
**[0:52:11-0:52:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:52:11):**  To ask, I mean, there's a question you might have thought about, actually, not many people  
**[0:52:15-0:52:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:52:15):**  do in this space, which is the reason I'm asking it.  
**[0:52:18-0:52:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:52:18):**  And what if tomorrow morning you would have or tonight, you'd be in charge of a $1 billion  
**[0:52:23-0:52:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:52:23):**  fund, you can invest it any way you want.  
**[0:52:26-0:52:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:52:26):**  What would be, let's say, a few car rides, what would be more or less the pie chart,  
**[0:52:29-0:52:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:52:29):**  you would put that money to work could be any duration you want, but it has to be invested,  
**[0:52:34-0:52:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:52:34):**  not granted.  
**[0:52:36-0:52:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:52:36):**  That's the infrastructure we've built at Steward to handle that capacity.  
**[0:52:39-0:52:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:52:39):**  My previous venture fund rises at a billion of AUM from all online retail investors.  
**[0:52:44-0:52:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:52:44):**  So my vision was to it from the beginning of let's do it from the grassroots.  
**[0:52:48-0:52:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:52:48):**  Let's start with one acre farm and 20 acre, then 100 and 1000.  
**[0:52:52-0:52:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:52:52):**  But let's build the infrastructure needed to support these farms all across the country  
**[0:52:56-0:53:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:52:56):**  and world to deploy the capital, but also to actually ensure those businesses are successful.  
**[0:53:02-0:53:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:53:02):**  So for us, it's just expanding our remit.  
**[0:53:04-0:53:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:53:04):**  We have thousands of farms already in our network and deals underwritten all around  
**[0:53:08-0:53:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:53:08):**  the country.  
**[0:53:09-0:53:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:53:09):**  But what I wouldn't do is start to do huge deals.  
**[0:53:12-0:53:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:53:12):**  I think the problem in agriculture is that the money is chasing the kind of very large  
**[0:53:16-0:53:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:53:16):**  10,000 plus acre type transactions or perennial row crops.  
**[0:53:21-0:53:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:53:21):**  The small medium enterprise, the few hundred acres, few thousand acres, even the one acre  
**[0:53:25-0:53:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:53:25):**  farm, that's where the funding is needed.  
**[0:53:27-0:53:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:53:27):**  So I would have it still be invested in chunks of 100,000, a few million.  
**[0:53:31-0:53:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:53:31):**  I would say that's kind of our sweet spot for financing.  
**[0:53:35-0:53:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:53:35):**  Most of the farms are looking for a few hundred thousand to a million, and then some of them  
**[0:53:39-0:53:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:53:39):**  are a million to five million.  
**[0:53:41-0:53:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:53:41):**  And that is the broad based support that is needed.  
**[0:53:43-0:53:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:53:43):**  So the point of Steward is to build the infrastructure that can deploy that money in an organized  
**[0:53:48-0:53:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:53:48):**  way, but also provide feedback and information to investors and build those connections.  
**[0:53:54-0:53:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:53:54):**  So I'm hoping that's where we are in a few years.  
**[0:53:57-0:54:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:53:57):**  And if you could wave, so you're no longer or not yet in charge of one billion dollar  
**[0:54:01-0:54:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:54:01):**  fund.  
**[0:54:02-0:54:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:54:02):**  If you could wave a magic wand and tomorrow morning we wake up and one thing in the food  
**[0:54:05-0:54:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:54:05):**  and egg space or industry has changed, what would that be?  
**[0:54:10-0:54:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:54:10):**  What would be your magic power?  
**[0:54:11-0:54:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:54:11):**  And one thing you could change.  
**[0:54:13-0:54:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:54:13):**  My discovery for Sustainable Ag came through the farmer and then from the farmer's eyes  
**[0:54:18-0:54:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:54:18):**  being confused as to their lack of access to capital.  
**[0:54:22-0:54:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:54:22):**  And at the end of the day, the lack of access to capital related to government regulations  
**[0:54:27-0:54:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:54:27):**  and government policy that over years had kind of created the wrong incentives.  
**[0:54:30-0:54:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:54:30):**  So I go back to the roots of if we just removed any of the national, federal, global ag policy  
**[0:54:36-0:54:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:54:36):**  and subsidies and incentives and just said, well, what farms can support themselves and  
**[0:54:40-0:54:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:54:40):**  how does it work in practice?  
**[0:54:43-0:54:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:54:43):**  Sustainable Ag would have such more growth because they're not reliant on third parties,  
**[0:54:47-0:54:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:54:47):**  not reliant on price supports, not reliant on subsidized external costs.  
**[0:54:52-0:54:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:54:52):**  So I look at the kind of goal to incentivize large commodity production as having such  
**[0:54:57-0:54:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:54:57):**  huge negative effects.  
**[0:54:59-0:55:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:54:59):**  Yes, it has created calories for people to eat and there's lots of arguments around those  
**[0:55:03-0:55:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:55:03):**  benefits maybe, maybe not.  
**[0:55:06-0:55:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:55:06):**  They're feeding the world.  
**[0:55:07-0:55:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:55:07):**  Yes, that's what you always hear from and you know, yes, they're creating calories,  
**[0:55:12-0:55:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:55:12):**  but let's instead of shipping to people around the world, let's create local capacity in  
**[0:55:16-0:55:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:55:16):**  these regions to produce for themselves to sell directly and to provide ecosystems just  
**[0:55:22-0:55:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:55:22):**  like I began with the Chesapeake Bay to restore and maintain the actual environmental and  
**[0:55:26-0:55:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:55:26):**  social quality of life.  
**[0:55:27-0:55:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:55:27):**  So I would hope, and it's kind of in the US, 2% of the farm bill goes to Sustainable Ag.  
**[0:55:33-0:55:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:55:33):**  They're like, yay, we've got more money.  
**[0:55:35-0:55:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:55:35):**  It's like, well, it's still all going in the wrong direction generally.  
**[0:55:38-0:55:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:55:38):**  98%.  
**[0:55:39-0:55:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:55:39):**  Yeah.  
**[0:55:40-0:55:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:55:40):**  So that's where I am at is I wish it was a level playing field because then these types  
**[0:55:46-0:55:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:55:46):**  of practices.  
**[0:55:47-0:55:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:55:47):**  They wouldn't stand a chance against the regen farmers we know.  
**[0:55:50-0:55:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:55:50):**  Yeah, they wouldn't be able to do it.  
**[0:55:52-0:55:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:55:52):**  Yeah, the EU is launching a huge farm to fork plan, which we have to see how, but at least  
**[0:55:59-0:56:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:55:59):**  it talks a lot of the talk.  
**[0:56:01-0:56:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:56:01):**  Let's see.  
**[0:56:02-0:56:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:56:02):**  I mean, let me know in the comments below what you think about that.  
**[0:56:04-0:56:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:56:04):**  They're farther ahead though.  
**[0:56:05-0:56:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:56:05):**  I would say the policy in Europe, they're trying to be more focused on land management.  
**[0:56:09-0:56:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:56:09):**  They're pushing for organic.  
**[0:56:10-0:56:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:56:10):**  There's a strong push for organic.  
**[0:56:11-0:56:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:56:11):**  I don't know if they know the potential, let's say to go beyond or the potential destruction  
**[0:56:16-0:56:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:56:16):**  of destructive practices that can be part of industrial organic, but at least it's a  
**[0:56:20-0:56:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:56:20):**  push.  
**[0:56:21-0:56:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:56:21):**  It's a discussion on chemical use.  
**[0:56:22-0:56:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:56:22):**  It's a discussion on obesity, which actually is part of the same program.  
**[0:56:26-0:56:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:56:26):**  It's a discussion on land use.  
**[0:56:28-0:56:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:56:28):**  It's discussion on fertilizer use, et cetera.  
**[0:56:32-0:56:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:56:32):**  That discussion we haven't had in the last years, at least not at that level.  
**[0:56:36-0:56:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:56:36):**  So yeah, I agree.  
**[0:56:37-0:56:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:56:37):**  And we do a lot of work at Stewart at local and state level.  
**[0:56:40-0:56:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:56:40):**  And so the kind of state rules we use to rate have funding.  
**[0:56:43-0:56:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:56:43):**  Yeah.  
**[0:56:44-0:56:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:56:44):**  So the countries here, the regions that are the strong, there's the region up here in  
**[0:56:49-0:56:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:56:49):**  the North of Italy that did a referendum and cut out all chemical use in farming.  
**[0:56:54-0:56:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:56:54):**  And they gave the farmers an ultimatum, like either move after a lot of research and they  
**[0:56:59-0:57:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:56:59):**  saw there was a lot of pesticide actually floating off the non-regenerative farms to  
**[0:57:03-0:57:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:57:03):**  a number of organic farms.  
**[0:57:05-0:57:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:57:05):**  Although the non-regenerative farms said that it wasn't possible to stay within their apple  
**[0:57:08-0:57:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:57:08):**  orchard, obviously it wasn't true.  
**[0:57:10-0:57:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:57:10):**  And they found a lot of the residue in milk and in cheese production, et cetera.  
**[0:57:15-0:57:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:57:15):**  And so they did a referendum and they gave the farms an ultimatum.  
**[0:57:18-0:57:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:57:18):**  Either you switch to organic or you have to move from the state because we're no longer  
**[0:57:23-0:57:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:57:23):**  going to support.  
**[0:57:24-0:57:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:57:24):**  It's going to be illegal here to not farm organically.  
**[0:57:26-0:57:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:57:26):**  And that's what we're finding in certain markets.  
**[0:57:28-0:57:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:57:28):**  Oregon is one where they've been very progressive on policies to enable local farmers, support  
**[0:57:32-0:57:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:57:32):**  local farmers, incentivize it.  
**[0:57:34-0:57:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:57:34):**  So we're trying to design at the local regional level, what are policies and frameworks that  
**[0:57:39-0:57:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:57:39):**  work in terms of access to capital and incentivizing the right type of ag.  
**[0:57:43-0:57:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:57:43):**  And then those can be broadened.  
**[0:57:45-0:57:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:57:45):**  And I like that work because you have to push against the system that's been built.  
**[0:57:50-0:57:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:57:50):**  The reason we're farming as we are today is because of the government and social structures  
**[0:57:54-0:57:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:57:54):**  around it.  
**[0:57:55-0:57:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:57:55):**  And so if you're going to try to improve regenerative agriculture, you have to look at the base  
**[0:57:59-0:58:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:57:59):**  impacts to it.  
**[0:58:01-0:58:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:58:01):**  Another thing connected to that is I think too many people focus on labels in this work.  
**[0:58:04-0:58:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:58:04):**  You've mentioned organic, industrial organic.  
**[0:58:07-0:58:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:58:07):**  Like in and of itself doesn't mean that much anymore.  
**[0:58:10-0:58:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:58:10):**  It's definitely been co-opted a bit as an industry term.  
**[0:58:13-0:58:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:58:13):**  A lot of the farms we work with, they don't even go through the certification because  
**[0:58:16-0:58:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:58:16):**  they have customers who visit them and buy on farm and believe in the products.  
**[0:58:20-0:58:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:58:20):**  And by seeing it and visiting it, you're going to get more than you would ever with a certification.  
**[0:58:24-0:58:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:58:24):**  So as people focus on investing regenerative agriculture, I hope it doesn't just become  
**[0:58:30-0:58:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:58:30):**  another commodity system where you need just a certification.  
**[0:58:33-0:58:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:58:33):**  But look at the underlying practices, which at the end of the day are what matters, not  
**[0:58:38-0:58:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:58:38):**  the label that's posted and stamped on the food.  
**[0:58:41-0:58:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:58:41):**  No, absolutely.  
**[0:58:42-0:58:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:58:42):**  I think it's, yeah, it's the underlying practices and being able to show what you have done  
**[0:58:47-0:58:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:58:47):**  and the transparency and the fact that you can visit many of these farms, I think already  
**[0:58:52-0:58:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:58:52):**  says something compared to a lot of other farms that you, we chased off by with dogs  
**[0:58:56-0:59:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:58:56):**  probably if you even show up at the gate, which strange idea says something about the  
**[0:59:01-0:59:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:59:01):**  market, very weird.  
**[0:59:03-0:59:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:59:03):**  What would they be hiding potentially, possibly?  
**[0:59:06-0:59:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:59:06):**  Final question, which is something that I took, definitely inspired by John Kempf.  
**[0:59:11-0:59:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:59:11):**  What do you believe to be true about regenerative agriculture?  
**[0:59:14-0:59:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:59:14):**  He asked about general agriculture, but let's say regenerative agriculture that others don't  
**[0:59:18-0:59:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:59:18):**  believe to be true.  
**[0:59:20-0:59:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:59:20):**  We had a few already in it, but what would be one you, if you had to pick one?  
**[0:59:24-0:59:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:59:24):**  For me, it's about understanding the business model and that there is viability in the business  
**[0:59:29-0:59:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:59:29):**  model.  
**[0:59:30-0:59:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:59:30):**  I think some studies that have shown that the organic matter in the soil actually is  
**[0:59:33-0:59:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:59:33):**  the closest correlation to return because your soil is actually producing the product.  
**[0:59:39-0:59:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:59:39):**  I read those, yeah.  
**[0:59:41-0:59:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:59:41):**  I had John Lundkorn on the podcast.  
**[0:59:44-0:59:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:59:44):**  It's not released yet.  
**[0:59:45-0:59:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:59:45):**  Maybe when you're listening to this, it is, which was fascinating, Profitability and Regen  
**[0:59:50-0:59:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:59:50):**  Egg.  
**[0:59:51-0:59:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:59:51):**  And they're coming out, not just with the study they did in 2018, but with many more,  
**[0:59:54-0:59:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:59:54):**  hopefully this year, which are going to be very interesting and scary for a few industries,  
**[0:59:59-1:00:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=0:59:59):**  particularly Elmonds, Rangelands, et cetera.  
**[1:00:02-1:00:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=1:00:02):**  But it's surprising how, how few there are.  
**[1:00:04-1:00:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=1:00:04):**  Like how many studies are there on profitability and Regen Egg?  
**[1:00:07-1:00:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=1:00:07):**  I found one, which is very scary.  
**[1:00:10-1:00:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=1:00:10):**  Very little, everyone's referenced in the same study.  
**[1:00:12-1:00:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=1:00:12):**  And what I see with these farms, and I had to learn it by doing is they keep their expenses  
**[1:00:17-1:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=1:00:17):**  very low.  
**[1:00:18-1:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=1:00:18):**  They're not buying big purchased inputs.  
**[1:00:19-1:00:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=1:00:19):**  They're not buying chemicals.  
**[1:00:21-1:00:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=1:00:21):**  They buy seeds and maybe some other basic inputs.  
**[1:00:24-1:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=1:00:24):**  They have very low overhead because they're lean operations.  
**[1:00:26-1:00:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=1:00:26):**  They use small tools or mid-size equipment and they have moderate sizes of land.  
**[1:00:32-1:00:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=1:00:32):**  And then they sell direct to the end user where they can get high margin, you know,  
**[1:00:35-1:00:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=1:00:35):**  40, 50, 60 percent.  
**[1:00:37-1:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=1:00:37):**  And then they recycle that.  
**[1:00:38-1:00:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=1:00:38):**  So it's a very simple and straightforward business.  
**[1:00:40-1:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=1:00:40):**  There's going to be variability in production and there are many elements, but at the end  
**[1:00:44-1:00:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=1:00:44):**  of the day, you're growing from the sun, improving the soil, selling direct.  
**[1:00:48-1:00:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=1:00:48):**  And that boost of funding and people say, well, what can they afford to pay?  
**[1:00:51-1:00:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=1:00:51):**  What are returns reasonable?  
**[1:00:53-1:00:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=1:00:53):**  If that system is set up and then you can fund a few hundred thousand dollars to get  
**[1:00:57-1:01:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=1:00:57):**  control of land and fencing and equipment, irrigation and value of the processing and  
**[1:01:00-1:01:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=1:01:00):**  some transport and some labor, you can accelerate that business so much.  
**[1:01:05-1:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=1:01:05):**  It's such a huge opportunity.  
**[1:01:06-1:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=1:01:06):**  And I think when people think of regenerative agriculture, they assume it's not competitive  
**[1:01:11-1:01:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=1:01:11):**  on that it can produce a reasonable return.  
**[1:01:13-1:01:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=1:01:13):**  And I think it is both.  
**[1:01:15-1:01:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=1:01:15):**  I don't expect it to produce hedge fund returns.  
**[1:01:17-1:01:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=1:01:17):**  No one should look at 20 percent.  
**[1:01:19-1:01:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=1:01:19):**  That's just our system.  
**[1:01:20-1:01:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=1:01:20):**  They haven't been amazing lately.  
**[1:01:21-1:01:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=1:01:21):**  No, they haven't.  
**[1:01:22-1:01:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=1:01:22):**  Well, it's the theoretical return, right?  
**[1:01:24-1:01:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=1:01:24):**  It's like the pitch.  
**[1:01:26-1:01:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=1:01:26):**  But I think people should be very happy with eight percent, 10 percent, six percent.  
**[1:01:31-1:01:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=1:01:31):**  You know, high single digits are solid or reliable.  
**[1:01:34-1:01:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=1:01:34):**  I go back off into forestry.  
**[1:01:36-1:01:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=1:01:36):**  The wood for forestry project grows six percent per year in mass.  
**[1:01:41-1:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=1:01:41):**  So at the end of the day, your growth of your return is somewhat connected to actual the  
**[1:01:45-1:01:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=1:01:45):**  growth of the biomass of these products.  
**[1:01:47-1:01:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=1:01:47):**  And so I think returns around that fit what can be produced from the land instability  
**[1:01:53-1:01:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=1:01:53):**  indefinitely.  
**[1:01:54-1:01:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=1:01:54):**  Whereas when you get to really higher numbers, you have to have aggressive leverage or really  
**[1:01:58-1:02:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=1:01:58):**  kind of hard market risk or it just gets complicated.  
**[1:02:01-1:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=1:02:01):**  So let's not make that also complimented.  
**[1:02:04-1:02:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=1:02:04):**  Yes.  
**[1:02:05-1:02:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=1:02:05):**  Keep that part at least.  
**[1:02:06-1:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=1:02:06):**  Just keep it simple.  
**[1:02:07-1:02:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=1:02:07):**  That's what we're hoping to do.  
**[1:02:08-1:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=1:02:08):**  We fund the farm directly, get your return, get some products to get connected to them,  
**[1:02:12-1:02:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=1:02:12):**  see the impact, see what they are able to achieve with that capital, get paid back and  
**[1:02:16-1:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=1:02:16):**  do it again.  
**[1:02:17-1:02:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=1:02:17):**  There's so much more to discuss, but let's keep that for another time.  
**[1:02:21-1:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/06/09/dan-miller#t=1:02:21):**  I want to thank you so much, Dan, for your time today and for diving a bit deeper into

**[0:00:12-0:00:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:00:13):**  Our guests today invested over 80 million in the last 8 years into vertically integrated  
**[0:00:18-0:00:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:00:18):**  agroforestry companies in Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa.  
**[0:00:22-0:00:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:00:22):**  What are their lessons learned?  
**[0:00:23-0:00:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:00:23):**  And what would they do differently next time?  
**[0:00:25-0:00:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:00:25):**  Plus what has changed in the last 10 years in the investor market and the consumer market,  
**[0:00:30-0:00:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:00:30):**  it seems like the consumer demand for clean, fair products is finally really starting to  
**[0:00:34-0:00:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:00:34):**  grow and become a significant pool with significant premiums, sometimes over 100%.  
**[0:00:41-0:00:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:00:41):**  This really changes the game for farmers, cooperatives, brands, etc.  
**[0:00:47-0:00:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:00:47):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture.  
**[0:00:51-0:00:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:00:51):**  Investing as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:53-0:00:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:00:53):**  This is the show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:57-0:01:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:00:57):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:01:02-0:01:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:01:02):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:01:07):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:09-0:01:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:01:09):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:13-0:01:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:01:13):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:15-0:01:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:01:15):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:20-0:01:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:01:20):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:24-0:01:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:01:24):**  In March last year, we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support  
**[0:01:28-0:01:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:01:28):**  our work.

**[0:01:49-0:01:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:01:49):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:01:51):**  Welcome to another episode today with the co-founder and CEO of Moringa.  
**[0:01:54-0:01:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:01:54):**  Moringa partnership is an investment fund which targets agroforestry projects located  
**[0:01:58-0:02:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:01:58):**  in Latin America and Sub Saharan Africa.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:02:01):**  Welcome Clément.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:02:02):**  Thank you, Keren.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:02:03):**  Good afternoon, everyone.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:02:04):**  To start with a personal question, how did you end up in agroforestry projects in soil  
**[0:02:08-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:02:08):**  in agriculture?  
**[0:02:09-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:02:09):**  What was your journey towards that sector?  
**[0:02:12-0:02:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:02:12):**  Okay, so maybe I can present myself.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:02:14):**  It's a long story.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:02:17):**  So my name is Clément Chennault.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:02:20):**  I'm 38 years old, French.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:02:23):**  When I was a kid, my goal was to work in forests and work for the French Forestry Commission  
**[0:02:30-0:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:02:30):**  in France.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:02:31):**  So that's what I did.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:02:32):**  I'm a biologist and a forest engineer of background.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:02:38):**  And when I arrived there, working for the French Forestry Commission, after my studies,  
**[0:02:44-0:02:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:02:44):**  I was also very sensitive to climate change and tropical deforestation issues in the south.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:02:52):**  And I wanted to know more about that and work into that space.  
**[0:02:56-0:02:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:02:56):**  Of course, there are a lot of things to do in French forests.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:02:59):**  There are a lot of challenges in France and European forests.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:03:03):**  But definitely there are more important challenges also affecting tropical forests that relate  
**[0:03:09-0:03:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:03:09):**  to deforestation and climate change.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:03:11):**  So I made a change in my work.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:03:14):**  And I worked during two years for Ernst & Young, you know, the auditing and consulting company.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:03:20):**  I worked on carbon finance, basically.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:03:23):**  And I was an auditor and consulting for big corporates on their climate change strategy.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:03:29):**  So I worked for Air France, for La Farge, total groups like that.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:03:34):**  So it was great to learn about climate change and how it was dealt by companies.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:03:40):**  But I had the opportunity to come back to my roots.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:03:44):**  I was appointed head of business development of the International Subsidiary of the French  
**[0:03:49-0:03:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:03:49):**  Forestry Commission, so ONF International, that has been working for decades in tropical  
**[0:03:54-0:04:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:03:54):**  countries and specifically on sustainable forest management and the fight against deforestation.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:04:02):**  And what we acknowledged at that time, it was in 2009, is when you look at deforestation  
**[0:04:07-0:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:04:07):**  and climate change, well, there are two issues affecting deforestation.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:04:12):**  It's agriculture.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:04:13):**  I mean, of course conservation is an important issue, but the drivers of deforestation are  
**[0:04:20-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:04:20):**  food production and poverty.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:04:23):**  Basically, that's poor farmers that need more revenues and that are cutting down trees to  
**[0:04:29-0:04:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:04:29):**  increase their livelihoods.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:04:31):**  And what we acknowledged also at that time, so more than 10 years ago, is that there are  
**[0:04:35-0:04:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:04:35):**  entrepreneurs, NGOs that are developing techniques.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:04:40):**  So agroforestry is one of these techniques that allow to bring more revenues to the farmer  
**[0:04:46-0:04:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:04:46):**  while restoring natural resources and protecting the forests.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:04:51):**  And what we acknowledged, so more than 10 years ago, is that you've got solutions, you've  
**[0:04:55-0:05:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:04:55):**  got entrepreneurs, but what is needed is money, investment to scale up.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:05:01):**  And philanthropy and cooperation money is not enough, private investments is needed.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:05:07):**  So that's why we started to discuss with banks and we partnered in 2010 with Edmond Rothschild,  
**[0:05:14-0:05:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:05:14):**  the Rothschild Bank, to establish the Moringa Fund.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:05:17):**  So that was the beginning of the Moringa Fund.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:05:19):**  That's how I went to raising money for and developing this investment fund named Moringa.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:05:28):**  And so can you describe, I mean, obviously, I'll put a link below in the description and  
**[0:05:33-0:05:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:05:33):**  also you have a very interesting white paper out.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:05:35):**  And what can you describe for everybody that thinks I've heard the name, but I've maybe  
**[0:05:39-0:05:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:05:39):**  seen the fund somewhere.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:05:41):**  But what is the Moringa Fund at the moment?  
**[0:05:43-0:05:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:05:43):**  We're now talking, let's say the end of 2021 or October 2021.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:05:47):**  What is currently the Moringa Fund?  
**[0:05:49-0:05:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:05:49):**  So Moringa is an impact investment fund.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:05:52):**  So it's a fund based in Luxembourg.  
**[0:05:56-0:06:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:05:56):**  We rose more than 80 million euros, so 80 million euros.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:06:01):**  Our investors are, it's a blend of development finance institutions, such as the Global Environmental  
**[0:06:08-0:06:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:06:08):**  Facilities, the African Development Bank, Pro Parco FMO from the Netherlands and private  
**[0:06:14-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:06:14):**  investors.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:06:15):**  So the Rothschild Bank invested alongside European family offices.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:06:21):**  What we do is private equity.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:06:22):**  We detected small and medium enterprise agroforestry SMEs, uniquely based in Latin America and  
**[0:06:30-0:06:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:06:30):**  Africa.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:06:31):**  That's our focus.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:06:32):**  And we brought 3 to 8 million euros of equity in agroforestry SMEs.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:06:39):**  So 3 to 8 million per SME.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:06:43):**  And one of those SMEs is like a processing company.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:06:47):**  What should I imagine?  
**[0:06:48-0:06:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:06:48):**  I mean, this is audio.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:06:50):**  So let's paint the picture.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:06:51):**  We're in an agroforestry project, large scale because it's always big.  
**[0:06:55-0:06:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:06:55):**  And what does this 3 to 8 million do?  
**[0:06:58-0:06:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:06:58):**  What kind of company should we imagine?  
**[0:06:59-0:07:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:06:59):**  Yeah, so all these companies share four features.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:07:03):**  And then I will describe one concrete example.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:07:06):**  But all of these companies developed agroforestry plantations at a large scale, so meaning hundreds  
**[0:07:12-0:07:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:07:12):**  or thousands of hectares.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:07:13):**  So I'm sure you're familiar with agroforestry, this combination of trees with crops and potentially  
**[0:07:18-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:07:18):**  livestock to have good level of food and timber production while restoring soils, while sequestrating  
**[0:07:26-0:07:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:07:26):**  carbon and restoring biodiversity.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:07:28):**  So that's the first feature.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:07:30):**  Second pillar of our investment, all of these companies are social pillars.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:07:34):**  So we work in very poor areas of Africa and Latin America.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:07:39):**  These companies do not develop industrial plantations.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:07:41):**  You can do agroforestry by acquiring land and develop large scale plantations.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:07:46):**  So these are outgrowing networks.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:07:49):**  So each company is working with hundreds or thousands of farmers gathered in cooperative  
**[0:07:55-0:07:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:07:55):**  of association and the companies bring technical know-how.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:07:59):**  They bring financing to develop the plantations and access to markets, they are off-taking  
**[0:08:03-0:08:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:08:03):**  the products from the farmers.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:08:05):**  Third pillar of this company is the local processing.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:08:08):**  So all of these companies do, they've got factories, they do at least primary processing  
**[0:08:14-0:08:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:08:14):**  for some of them, secondary processing and for some of them even they are marketing their  
**[0:08:19-0:08:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:08:19):**  own products.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:08:20):**  And the fourth pillar is the market.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:08:22):**  I could have started by that, that really the business model is to work on two markets.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:08:28):**  So first market is the market for sustainable and healthy food.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:08:32):**  Typically in the US and Europe where consumers are ready to pay a premium because the products  
**[0:08:39-0:08:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:08:39):**  have got good health properties and good sustainability properties, so all the companies are certified,  
**[0:08:47-0:08:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:08:47):**  for example BRC certified or ISO 22 certified, all the companies are organic certified, fair  
**[0:08:53-0:08:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:08:53):**  trade certified.  
**[0:08:54-0:08:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:08:54):**  So depending on the products, they've got different kind of certification.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:08:59):**  Our objective is to get big premiums.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:09:02):**  That's how we remunerate the good environmental and social practices implemented on the ground.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:09:07):**  And the second market that these companies are targeting are the local markets, especially  
**[0:09:12-0:09:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:09:12):**  in Africa where you've got a booming demand for food and fiber.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:09:17):**  So to give you two illustrations, we've got 10 projects, but maybe two emblematic projects.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:09:23):**  Our first investment was in Nicaragua.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:09:25):**  So it's two companies, Nicafrance and Nicafrance Outgrowers.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:09:28):**  It's a coffee cluster.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:09:30):**  They have renovated 2,000 hectares of degraded coffee farms in the country using agroforestry  
**[0:09:35-0:09:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:09:35):**  techniques.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:09:36):**  It's a cluster of high quality coffee and we have signed a deal with Nespresso that  
**[0:09:41-0:09:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:09:41):**  developed a capsule.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:09:42):**  The Nicaraguan capsule is coming from these investments.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:09:46):**  That's how we get premiums.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:09:48):**  Other example is in Benin, Tolaro.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:09:52):**  It's a cashew company working with 7,000 farmers, organic, fair trade certified.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:09:57):**  That's the only factory in Africa that do unshilling, but also roasting the nuts, producing  
**[0:10:04-0:10:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:10:04):**  cashew flour and butter and now directly selling its products, especially in the United States  
**[0:10:13-0:10:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:10:13):**  with brands such as Whole Foods and others.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:10:15):**  So that's two illustrations of projects we've got in the portfolio.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:10:19):**  And you mentioned 10 companies, so about 3 to 8 million.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:10:23):**  So you have invested everything or you're still in the investment phase of the fund?  
**[0:10:28-0:10:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:10:28):**  We are out of the investment phase.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:10:29):**  So we have deployed the capital.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:10:31):**  We're still doing limited follow on.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:10:35):**  So reinvestments within the portfolio line, but we are not doing any more new investments.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:10:41):**  And indeed, we're at year 8 of the fund.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:10:45):**  The first closing was in 2013.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:10:48):**  So we're in the phase of exit.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:10:49):**  In fact, our model is to provide equity to these companies.  
**[0:10:56-0:10:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:10:56):**  When we invested, there were greenfield companies, startups.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:10:59):**  Now these companies have developed a plantation, built the factories.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:11:03):**  Their level of revenues is increasing.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:11:06):**  Some of the companies are profitable.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:11:09):**  So we're looking for exit partners.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:11:11):**  We still have some time, but we're in active discussion with several potential acquirers.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:11:17):**  And we are now in the last phase of the fund, which is to find partners to acquire our participation  
**[0:11:23-0:11:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:11:23):**  and pursue the development of the platforms that were created.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:11:27):**  And so what have you learned?  
**[0:11:28-0:11:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:11:28):**  What has been the 10 years or eight, nine years?  
**[0:11:30-0:11:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:11:30):**  What is the main, what has changed as well?  
**[0:11:32-0:11:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:11:32):**  But it's a separate question.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:11:33):**  What are the main lessons learned on this space?  
**[0:11:37-0:11:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:11:37):**  I mean, Moringa is really one of the first funds dedicated to agroforestry.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:11:45):**  We were one of the very few funds over the past 10 years investing in agroecology, agroforestry,  
**[0:11:53-0:11:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:11:53):**  especially in emerging countries.  
**[0:11:55-0:12:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:11:55):**  It's a lot of risk doing agroforestry, doing private equity in emerging countries.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:12:01):**  So we had to face a lot of challenges as such pioneers.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:12:06):**  And surely some learned the positive news.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:12:10):**  What is really positive is the evolution of the market.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:12:13):**  When we developed the fund 10 years ago, we marketed the fund.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:12:19):**  You mean the market of consumers or the market of investors?  
**[0:12:22-0:12:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:12:22):**  No, no, no, no, the investors.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:12:23):**  And talking about the investors, we met with 600 or 700 investors.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:12:29):**  So we've got 20 investors within the fund.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:12:31):**  At that time, nobody knew what was agroforestry.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:12:33):**  I mean, we had to explain.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:12:36):**  And now it's much more known.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:12:37):**  And on the market side, clearly on the market for healthy, sustainable food, I mean, the  
**[0:12:44-0:12:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:12:44):**  organic segment, you've got very high growth there.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:12:47):**  So it's a market that was a niche, was a very small niche 10 years ago.  
**[0:12:52-0:12:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:12:52):**  And now it's still a niche.  
**[0:12:54-0:12:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:12:54):**  Its organic market is 5% share of the global food market.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:12:58):**  So it's still a niche, but with a high growth.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:13:00):**  So this, of course, is a good signal for investors.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:13:03):**  And in addition to that, let's say on climate change and biodiversity, you've got more and  
**[0:13:09-0:13:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:13:09):**  more pressure to remunerate the environmental benefits of such activities.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:13:15):**  And that's also a very positive evolution of the market.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:13:18):**  So that's the good news, the good evolution.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:13:21):**  What was not the less good news is execution.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:13:24):**  I mean, agroforestry, agroecology on the paper is very promising, but on execution, it's  
**[0:13:31-0:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:13:31):**  it all looks nice.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:13:32):**  These different layers of forestry on every infographic, it looks amazing.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:13:36):**  Yeah.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:13:37):**  Yeah.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:13:38):**  So we did great slides 10 years ago about one plus one would make you three because  
**[0:13:44-0:13:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:13:44):**  of the synergies and so on.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:13:46):**  But in reality, it's much more difficult.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:13:48):**  I mean, execution is a real challenge.  
**[0:13:52-0:13:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:13:52):**  The plantation level, you have higher costs, more complexity.  
**[0:13:57-0:14:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:13:57):**  So developing this plantation is difficult.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:14:00):**  We did it with outgrowing schemes.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:14:02):**  So this is also complex to manage.  
**[0:14:05-0:14:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:14:05):**  Developing factories in those geographies is not easy.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:14:08):**  It's more costly than factories based in Asia or even in Europe and United States.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:14:14):**  So you've got a lot of other costs.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:14:16):**  And the market is there with premium, but you are it's a very strong fight.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:14:20):**  It's a very strong fight to get premium and to get properly remunerated.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:14:26):**  That being said, we've got good news and very, very good case stories.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:14:31):**  But maybe one of the lessons learned and thinking about the future, something we won't repeat  
**[0:14:37-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:14:37):**  is really important and long term investments.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:14:40):**  So you need to convert farms to agroforestry practices to develop these processing factories  
**[0:14:48-0:14:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:14:48):**  to access to the market.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:14:49):**  It's really long run investments.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:14:52):**  And Moringa was structured as a closed end vehicle of 12 years, which is already long  
**[0:14:57-0:14:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:14:57):**  compared to conventional.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:14:58):**  But you need more time.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:15:00):**  You need more time to really benefit from the added value from such investments.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:15:04):**  So that's an important lesson learned is to be able to have the capacities to deal with  
**[0:15:12-0:15:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:15:12):**  technical complexities and have a structure that is perennial and on the long run to capture  
**[0:15:19-0:15:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:15:19):**  the added value from such practices.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:15:22):**  Do you think the market is ready?  
**[0:15:23-0:15:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:15:23):**  Like the investor market 10 years ago, I would say for sure not.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:15:26):**  But now I hear a lot of discussions actually.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:15:29):**  And I just saw Sequoia, the big VC launching an evergreen fund.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:15:33):**  Do you think the market might be ready for longer term vehicles or is that another fight?  
**[0:15:38-0:15:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:15:38):**  More?  
**[0:15:39-0:15:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:15:39):**  Yeah, but more than 10 years ago.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:15:42):**  So that's what we're working on, working on a new vehicle.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:15:46):**  I cannot make any announcement today.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:15:49):**  I'm sorry you have to interview me in two months time, but it's well advanced.  
**[0:15:54-0:15:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:15:54):**  I'm working on a new structure to do long term investments.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:15:59):**  And I can say that we've got much better, I mean, 10 years ago we did it as a closed  
**[0:16:05-0:16:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:16:05):**  end vehicle because we were doing agroforestry in emerging countries.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:16:10):**  So investors wanted liquidity.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:16:11):**  They say, oh no, it's too risky.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:16:12):**  I want liquidity.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:16:13):**  I want to get back my money if I want.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:16:16):**  But now we explain that it's not coherent with this type of investment.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:16:22):**  And we've got investors that are more aligned, that understand first that it's not the right  
**[0:16:28-0:16:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:16:28):**  strategy and we've got long term investors that are keen to back such evergreen structure.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:16:36):**  So it's not yet done.  
**[0:16:37-0:16:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:16:37):**  So we'll tell you.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:16:40):**  We'll check in in a couple of months.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:16:42):**  But clearly this has changed.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:16:46):**  And I really believe that the right strategy, sustainable agriculture, you need to have  
**[0:16:51-0:16:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:16:51):**  a long term perspective.  
**[0:16:53-0:16:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:16:53):**  You mentioned also in the white paper as well the importance of blended capital.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:16:58):**  What role has that played in Moringa?  
**[0:17:01-0:17:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:17:01):**  And is that still crucial or was it really something because 10 years ago and eight years  
**[0:17:07-0:17:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:17:07):**  ago, et cetera, the sector was so much less developed?  
**[0:17:10-0:17:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:17:10):**  What do you see as the role for more blended capital approaches?  
**[0:17:13-0:17:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:17:13):**  10 years ago, it was, I mean, we won't have closed the Moringa fund without public money.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:17:21):**  So we had a target to do 50 50 in the end, more 70 public, 30 private.  
**[0:17:28-0:17:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:17:28):**  But 10 years ago, it was impossible to raise such funds.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:17:31):**  And when you say 70 30, meaning 70 percent of the fund was from public entities, but  
**[0:17:36-0:17:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:17:36):**  they entered as an investor or they entered as a grant giver.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:17:39):**  Yeah, we'll come back on this.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:17:42):**  On the blended structure, we don't have the layers.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:17:45):**  You know, there are a lot of fund structures with layers.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:17:49):**  For us, it's more straightforward.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:17:52):**  It's all the investors have got the same rights.  
**[0:17:55-0:18:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:17:55):**  That being said, we've got a technical assistance facility alongside the fund, which is pure  
**[0:18:00-0:18:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:18:00):**  grants and which is financed by the development finance institutions.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:18:06):**  And that's great.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:18:07):**  That's really this TF facility helped us a lot.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:18:12):**  But at the fund level, it's a blend of public and private investors.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:18:15):**  But there are no layers, but without the public players at the capital, we won't have been  
**[0:18:22-0:18:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:18:22):**  able to have the private investors around the table.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:18:28):**  So that was for the first fund.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:18:29):**  Now this has changed.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:18:31):**  We see more and more appetite from the private sector, especially on topics such as related  
**[0:18:41-0:18:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:18:41):**  to carbon and climate change.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:18:44):**  That's really a hot topic for many private investors.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:18:48):**  So we saw a lot of appetite.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:18:53):**  That being said, there are still important risks, especially because we work in emerging  
**[0:18:58-0:18:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:18:58):**  countries.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:18:59):**  I would say that most of the markets that we operate in...  
**[0:19:04-0:19:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:19:04):**  You mean currencies, you mean political risk?  
**[0:19:07-0:19:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:19:07):**  Yeah, all those risks.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:19:09):**  And having been backed by development finance institutions is great to get funding, potentially  
**[0:19:17-0:19:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:19:17):**  day risk private funding, but also it's a support when you've got problems in those  
**[0:19:22-0:19:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:19:22):**  geographies.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:19:23):**  So definitely for the new vehicle, I'm looking forward to having much more private investors.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:19:30):**  I'm really optimistic.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:19:33):**  But in the space, even though there are more investors, it's not massive to a point where  
**[0:19:40-0:19:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:19:40):**  you would say that the public sector has no more role to play.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:19:46):**  We're not there at all.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:19:47):**  Maybe the next one.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:19:48):**  Yeah, maybe in 15 or 20.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:19:51):**  But right now there is a clear support to be given by public investors.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:19:58):**  And you mentioned also something around the decommodisation of the value chain or the  
**[0:20:03-0:20:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:20:03):**  value webs, as some people like to call it, because obviously chains come from a very  
**[0:20:07-0:20:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:20:07):**  colonial background.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:20:09):**  What have you done around it?  
**[0:20:11-0:20:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:20:11):**  You mentioned the deal with Nespresso and really going for these premiums.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:20:14):**  What have you learned there on this decommodisation piece that seems to be a hot topic now as  
**[0:20:18-0:20:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:20:18):**  well?  
**[0:20:19-0:20:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:20:19):**  It's really...  
**[0:20:20-0:20:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:20:20):**  That was the basis of our strategy when we established the fund.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:20:26):**  And this is to get better prices.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:20:29):**  And typically when you work in the organic and fair trade space, you get premiums, but  
**[0:20:37-0:20:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:20:37):**  that are very limited.  
**[0:20:39-0:20:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:20:39):**  Maybe it's 10%, 15%.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:20:42):**  Those premiums are even being reduced right now because there are more and more production.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:20:47):**  It's very difficult to compensate the additional cost you may have, the additional risk.  
**[0:20:53-0:20:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:20:53):**  That's not enough.  
**[0:20:55-0:21:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:20:55):**  Where you've got a real potential is when you build a story around the products and  
**[0:21:03-0:21:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:21:03):**  you do not only sell a commodity, which can be a good commodity if you sell a commodity  
**[0:21:08-0:21:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:21:08):**  that is fair trade and organic certified.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:21:10):**  Okay, but it's a better commodity, but it's still a commodity.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:21:13):**  But where you can get much better premium is when you're able to really market the story  
**[0:21:23-0:21:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:21:23):**  of your products, its benefits, and when you shortcut food value chains.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:21:27):**  And you've got a lot of intermediaries.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:21:30):**  And today there is a demand from the consumers to shortcut, to have as limited intermediaries  
**[0:21:37-0:21:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:21:37):**  as possible.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:21:38):**  So it's a clear demand from the consumers.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:21:41):**  And these consumers are even able to pay better prices for those products.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:21:45):**  So that's where really we see a potential added value.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:21:49):**  And you can get premium which are not 10, 15%, but maybe 50, maybe 100%, 150.  
**[0:21:57-0:21:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:21:57):**  I won't tell you exactly.  
**[0:21:58-0:21:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:21:58):**  No, no, no.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:21:59):**  We don't want to know, but it's significantly more.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:22:03):**  We did some premium over 100%.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:22:06):**  And this is because you buy from Benin or from Nicaragua or from Mali, you directly  
**[0:22:14-0:22:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:22:14):**  sell your products to a brand or a retailer based in the US or Europe.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:22:19):**  And that's a demand from the consumers.  
**[0:22:22-0:22:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:22:22):**  I believe that's an evolution from the market, which is great, which is great to really favor  
**[0:22:29-0:22:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:22:29):**  those environmental and social practices such as agroecology, such as agroforestry.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:22:36):**  That being said, even so the market is going into that direction, it's not that easy when  
**[0:22:45-0:22:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:22:45):**  you're rooted in Africa or Latam, when you talk to Whole Foods or Walmart.  
**[0:22:52-0:22:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:22:52):**  It's not easy.  
**[0:22:53-0:22:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:22:53):**  It's a long walk.  
**[0:22:54-0:22:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:22:54):**  That's what the distance learner told you.  
**[0:22:57-0:23:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:22:57):**  It's a long walk to be registered, to get the trust.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:23:00):**  Import and export.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:23:01):**  Because that's a problem because this player, why they work with intermediaries, with traders,  
**[0:23:07-0:23:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:23:07):**  because they trust those traders to manage this complex value chain based in very risky  
**[0:23:13-0:23:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:23:13):**  countries.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:23:14):**  To always have cashew nuts wherever they come from, but to always have the space in the  
**[0:23:18-0:23:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:23:18):**  supermarket full.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:23:19):**  Exactly.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:23:20):**  They want volume, they want the quality.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:23:22):**  So it's a long walk.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:23:24):**  It's a very long walk.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:23:25):**  But when you get it, when you're there, that's really a lot of potential added value.  
**[0:23:33-0:23:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:23:33):**  That's how these type of companies can economically be viable.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:23:37):**  Would you describe almost that as the biggest shift in the last 10 years of that there is  
**[0:23:42-0:23:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:23:42):**  a much bigger consumer pool and also willingness of retailers to do something about it?  
**[0:23:48-0:23:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:23:48):**  Because if they don't want to and they just keep working with their normal intermediaries,  
**[0:23:52-0:23:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:23:52):**  you can knock on their door, but they won't open.  
**[0:23:54-0:23:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:23:54):**  I believe that this demand was always there.  
**[0:23:57-0:23:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:23:57):**  That's my theory.  
**[0:23:58-0:23:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:23:58):**  That's my personal view.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:23:59):**  I believe you want to know what you eat.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:24:02):**  You want to know how it was made.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:24:04):**  We want to know, but does the average Walmart or the average consumer?  
**[0:24:08-0:24:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:24:08):**  Yeah.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:24:09):**  But so what happened over the past decades, we've got these commodities, but that's a  
**[0:24:15-0:24:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:24:15):**  parenthesis in history.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:24:16):**  Through history, I mean, 50 or 60 years ago, our grandparents were buying local products.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:24:22):**  They knew how the products were made.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:24:24):**  But during these 50 to 60 years, we had this industrial food being developed with coffee  
**[0:24:32-0:24:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:24:32):**  that you don't know.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:24:33):**  Coffee is coffee.  
**[0:24:34-0:24:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:24:34):**  It's a commodity.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:24:35):**  You don't know how the coffee was made.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:24:38):**  So a system was put in place of commodities without any information about the products.  
**[0:24:45-0:24:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:24:45):**  And right now, what is happening is that through the new technologies, so you've got different  
**[0:24:49-0:24:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:24:49):**  channels, so you've got the retails, but you can buy your food on the internet.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:24:53):**  I mean, Tola Ro is selling directly on Amazon.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:24:59):**  So you've got new food channels that compete with the conventional retail, and that's an  
**[0:25:04-0:25:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:25:04):**  opportunity because that's a demand from the consumers.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:25:07):**  And so you've got different channels.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:25:09):**  So that's for me, that's why I explain this tendency.  
**[0:25:14-0:25:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:25:14):**  And I believe this will continue.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:25:17):**  And through the traceability, through the traceability tools that are being developed,  
**[0:25:22-0:25:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:25:22):**  there will be more and more transparency, which will be very good.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:25:26):**  So that's how I explain what is happening on the market right now.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:25:30):**  And how have you, maybe a personal question, but if so, how has your buying behavior as  
**[0:25:35-0:25:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:25:35):**  a person changed over the last 10 years?  
**[0:25:38-0:25:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:25:38):**  By everything you've learned and seen, like, are you buying very differently than 10 years  
**[0:25:42-0:25:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:25:42):**  ago?  
**[0:25:43-0:25:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:25:43):**  Well, that's personal, but one of my passions is gastronomy.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:25:50):**  I love wines and food.  
**[0:25:53-0:25:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:25:53):**  So I've always been very sensitive.  
**[0:25:57-0:26:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:25:57):**  I always, I mean, I prefer to eat less, but very good products.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:26:02):**  You became more extreme, for sure.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:26:05):**  So that was a natural thing.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:26:08):**  But definitely with what I did over the past 10 years, I'm more and more selective with  
**[0:26:13-0:26:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:26:13):**  what I'm buying.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:26:16):**  And shifting gears a bit to the investing side, obviously, we're not giving investment  
**[0:26:21-0:26:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:26:21):**  advice, but you've talked to so many investors and are now talking again.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:26:24):**  And you've learned so much over the last 10 years.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:26:27):**  Let's say we're in a big theater and we're on stage and we're doing this interview live.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:26:32):**  And there comes a question from an investor in the room saying, okay, I've read the books,  
**[0:26:35-0:26:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:26:35):**  I read the white paper, I saw some movies, and I really want to get active in the space,  
**[0:26:40-0:26:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:26:40):**  but I don't know where and how.  
**[0:26:42-0:26:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:26:42):**  What would you tell him or her?  
**[0:26:44-0:26:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:26:44):**  What would be a first step for someone that has money to invest but doesn't know where  
**[0:26:48-0:26:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:26:48):**  to start?  
**[0:26:49-0:26:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:26:49):**  I mean, today they've got quite a lot of opportunities being developed.  
**[0:26:56-0:26:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:26:56):**  Definitely, it's a market with opportunities.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:26:59):**  And now you're seeing quite a lot of investment proposals, vehicles, funds.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:27:08):**  So I believe you've got opportunities.  
**[0:27:11-0:27:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:27:11):**  I would be very cautious about your partners.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:27:14):**  It's what I said, I mean, it's a promising market.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:27:18):**  On theory, it can provide environmental social benefits and a return, but it's not as easy  
**[0:27:26-0:27:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:27:26):**  to get there.  
**[0:27:27-0:27:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:27:27):**  Agriculture is complex, even more agroforestry and agroecology.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:27:31):**  So select the right partner you want to work with because in the end, that's them that  
**[0:27:37-0:27:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:27:37):**  will make a difference.  
**[0:27:40-0:27:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:27:40):**  And if I look at what we did over the past 10 years, what went well, what went less well,  
**[0:27:45-0:27:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:27:45):**  it's not about having the right business plan.  
**[0:27:49-0:27:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:27:49):**  It's really about having the right partners.  
**[0:27:52-0:27:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:27:52):**  And what do you believe to be true about regenerative agriculture that others don't?  
**[0:27:58-0:28:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:27:58):**  This question comes from John Kemp.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:28:00):**  So basically I'm asking, where are you contrarian?  
**[0:28:02-0:28:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:28:02):**  Where do you see, I mean, one of them obviously is not as easy, but where do you see when  
**[0:28:07-0:28:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:28:07):**  you go to conferences, when you went to conferences now?  
**[0:28:09-0:28:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:28:09):**  You can go again in person, but where do you see that you think clearly differently than  
**[0:28:14-0:28:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:28:14):**  the sector about regenerative agriculture and food?  
**[0:28:17-0:28:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:28:17):**  I'm not sure if I'm contrarian.  
**[0:28:20-0:28:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:28:20):**  If there's anything, obviously.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:28:22):**  What I can say, my view, I can give you my view on regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:28:27):**  I mean, I've seen examples and I have in mind large scale examples where really it's very  
**[0:28:33-0:28:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:28:33):**  convincing and it can work.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:28:37):**  One of the projects that for me that is the most striking, I don't know if you learned  
**[0:28:40-0:28:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:28:40):**  about these projects through your podcast or you even discussed it, is the case of Nachive  
**[0:28:47-0:28:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:28:47):**  in Brazil.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:28:48):**  So that's the Balbo family in sugar.  
**[0:28:51-0:29:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:28:51):**  Leontino Balbo, we worked with him in Brazil and he developed sugar cane in regenerative  
**[0:29:00-0:29:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:29:00):**  agriculture.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:29:01):**  When we talk about regenerative agriculture, there are a lot of examples showing that it  
**[0:29:04-0:29:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:29:04):**  works well at a small scale and you've got very limited examples at an industrial scale.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:29:11):**  And I've seen this example for me striking, I mean, 10,000 hectares of sugar cane.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:29:19):**  You've got better yields than conventional sugar in Brazil, less cost.  
**[0:29:24-0:29:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:29:24):**  It's really a success story.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:29:26):**  More biodiversity on the farm.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:29:27):**  Yeah.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:29:28):**  You've got everything and at a large scale and it's a very nice story.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:29:34):**  That being said, so having invested for 10 years in such type of projects, I can tell  
**[0:29:41-0:29:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:29:41):**  you that you need a lot of investments and that's what the Balbo family made.  
**[0:29:47-0:29:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:29:47):**  They had to invest a lot on the long run.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:29:51):**  And at the beginning, you've got more costs, you've got less revenues, penetration of the  
**[0:29:57-0:29:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:29:57):**  market is complex.  
**[0:29:58-0:29:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:29:58):**  More problems.  
**[0:29:59-0:30:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:29:59):**  Yeah.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:30:00):**  I really believe, I mean, the model on the long run, but on the short to middle run,  
**[0:30:06-0:30:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:30:06):**  it's very complex.  
**[0:30:07-0:30:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:30:07):**  The first five to 10 years, I mean, it's more investment.  
**[0:30:11-0:30:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:30:11):**  You need to be prepared to that.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:30:13):**  So I really believe in the model and on the benefits on the long run, but maybe we hear  
**[0:30:20-0:30:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:30:20):**  too much positive things and especially about what happened during the first five to 10  
**[0:30:27-0:30:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:30:27):**  years.  
**[0:30:28-0:30:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:30:28):**  But what would happen overnight?  
**[0:30:31-0:30:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:30:31):**  Obviously, you're working on a new structure, but let's say you are managing quite a large  
**[0:30:37-0:30:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:30:37):**  fund, let's say 1 billion or maybe let's say even 10.  
**[0:30:40-0:30:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:30:40):**  So resources you've raised it.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:30:42):**  What would you do?  
**[0:30:43-0:30:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:30:43):**  I'm not interested in the exact dollars or euros, but I'm interested, what would you  
**[0:30:46-0:30:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:30:46):**  focus on if you had to?  
**[0:30:48-0:30:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:30:48):**  And this could be even a very long-term investment fund.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:30:51):**  You can choose the timing, but what would you, with all your knowledge and your experience,  
**[0:30:56-0:30:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:30:56):**  focus on if you had a large investment fund?  
**[0:30:59-0:31:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:30:59):**  Because I think this kind of money is starting to come to the space.  
**[0:31:02-0:31:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:31:02):**  We're getting, especially if more people start paying attention to the potential, to obviously  
**[0:31:07-0:31:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:31:07):**  the environmental and social.  
**[0:31:08-0:31:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:31:08):**  So we're getting probably more interest from investors, large scale investors that need  
**[0:31:13-0:31:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:31:13):**  to put a lot of money in the space and we need to be ready.  
**[0:31:15-0:31:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:31:15):**  So I would like to start asking this question more and more to see, to get us ready to think  
**[0:31:19-0:31:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:31:19):**  not about 100 million, but about 1 billion or 10 billion.  
**[0:31:23-0:31:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:31:23):**  What would you do with so much assets under management?  
**[0:31:27-0:31:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:31:27):**  First of all, I would be cautious because for me the most important is the deal flow  
**[0:31:33-0:31:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:31:33):**  and you need to have a good deal to deploy such capital.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:31:38):**  And today, even so the sector is evolving and growing, there are still a lot of steps  
**[0:31:45-0:31:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:31:45):**  to be done to deploy such amounts.  
**[0:31:49-0:31:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:31:49):**  And it's useless to go too fast.  
**[0:31:51-0:31:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:31:51):**  I mean, there are, especially to manage cautiously investors' money, you need to go step by step  
**[0:31:58-0:32:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:31:58):**  and I would be cautious to not to deploy too fast.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:32:03):**  So 2 billion would be too much, 1 billion, okay.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:32:07):**  Would you also invest in technology or inputs?  
**[0:32:10-0:32:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:32:10):**  Would you land or seaweed?  
**[0:32:12-0:32:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:32:12):**  It could be anything.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:32:13):**  You're completely free.  
**[0:32:14-0:32:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:32:14):**  You don't have to invest in the Moringa thesis.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:32:17):**  It could be any way to deploy.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:32:20):**  I see a lot of potential in vertical integration.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:32:26):**  So investing in value chains that from farm to fork.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:32:32):**  So investments that will develop plantations, but also processing, marketing and distribution.  
**[0:32:41-0:32:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:32:41):**  So vertical integration basis, especially for healthy food segments, because you want  
**[0:32:53-0:32:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:32:53):**  to know exactly what to eat.  
**[0:32:56-0:33:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:32:56):**  The second sector where I see a lot of potential and you know when the Moringa fund was established  
**[0:33:02-0:33:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:33:02):**  10 years ago, that was one sector that we really targeted, but that fell and now it's  
**[0:33:10-0:33:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:33:10):**  coming back, is the remuneration of environmental externalities, carbon capture, biodiversity.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:33:18):**  I believe it's too early, but I see a very important market opportunity for the forest  
**[0:33:26-0:33:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:33:26):**  and ag sector in carbon.  
**[0:33:30-0:33:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:33:30):**  And there I would invest.  
**[0:33:32-0:33:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:33:32):**  And if you could change one thing overnight, so you no longer have the fund, unfortunately,  
**[0:33:39-0:33:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:33:39):**  of 1 billion, but you have a magic power to change one thing.  
**[0:33:42-0:33:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:33:42):**  Could be anything in the food and agriculture space.  
**[0:33:44-0:33:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:33:44):**  Could be better taste for everyone or our tongue development or consciousness of global  
**[0:33:50-0:33:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:33:50):**  transparency or, I don't know, making pesticides, chemical pesticides illegal, whatever you  
**[0:33:55-0:33:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:33:55):**  want.  
**[0:33:56-0:33:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:33:56):**  What would you, but only one thing, what would you change?  
**[0:33:59-0:34:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:33:59):**  For me it would be traceability because I really trust people.  
**[0:34:05-0:34:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:34:05):**  And you don't want to consume products that provoke deforestation, that are associated  
**[0:34:11-0:34:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:34:11):**  to child labor, polluting water, destroying soil.  
**[0:34:18-0:34:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:34:18):**  Nobody wants that, but you don't know.  
**[0:34:20-0:34:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:34:20):**  You don't know the negative things, but you don't know also the positive things.  
**[0:34:24-0:34:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:34:24):**  And I really believe that to change the food market, you need to favor, I mean, that's  
**[0:34:31-0:34:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:34:31):**  the green premiums, the notion of green premiums, you need to favor the products that are really  
**[0:34:37-0:34:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:34:37):**  bringing on the benefits and de-favor the others.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:34:41):**  And for me, what is really needed is traceability.  
**[0:34:45-0:34:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:34:45):**  And today you've got tools that exist that need to be implemented.  
**[0:34:49-0:34:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:34:49):**  You need regulation to impose such traceability.  
**[0:34:54-0:35:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:34:54):**  But for me, that's really what is needed from a sustainability perspective.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:35:00):**  And what kind of tools do you see now are being ready to be deployed to be used for  
**[0:35:05-0:35:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:35:05):**  that?  
**[0:35:06-0:35:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:35:06):**  What you see today, you've got different tools that inform you on the quality of the products  
**[0:35:15-0:35:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:35:15):**  themselves.  
**[0:35:16-0:35:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:35:16):**  So meaning as an end consumer, I can scan like the barcode.  
**[0:35:20-0:35:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:35:20):**  Yeah, you scan and you know, okay, I'm eating chocolates.  
**[0:35:25-0:35:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:35:25):**  Okay.  
**[0:35:26-0:35:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:35:26):**  So I know if it's good or not for me because I have sugar in it.  
**[0:35:31-0:35:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:35:31):**  So in France, we've got an application named Yuca.  
**[0:35:35-0:35:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:35:35):**  They've got different applications everywhere.  
**[0:35:39-0:35:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:35:39):**  But that's about health.  
**[0:35:41-0:35:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:35:41):**  But for me, the next step is to have this kind of tool available on sustainability,  
**[0:35:48-0:35:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:35:48):**  on where does the product come from, who are the intermediaries, and then what were the  
**[0:35:53-0:35:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:35:53):**  potential environmental and social impact associated to such products.  
**[0:35:57-0:36:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:35:57):**  There is a lot to be done because all these intermediaries make difficult access to such  
**[0:36:06-0:36:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:36:06):**  information and such tools.  
**[0:36:08-0:36:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:36:08):**  But yes, there are already some tools available.  
**[0:36:11-0:36:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:36:11):**  And for me, what is a necessity is to develop these tools as a large scale and make them  
**[0:36:17-0:36:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:36:17):**  compulsory in the end.  
**[0:36:18-0:36:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:36:18):**  I mean, it should be regulated and it should be something required.  
**[0:36:24-0:36:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:36:24):**  And then do you think, because I've seen the wave of some of these tools, I think 10 years  
**[0:36:29-0:36:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:36:29):**  ago where you could scan some barcodes and some, it gave a sort of score, etc.  
**[0:36:34-0:36:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:36:34):**  But it felt at least at that time, but maybe it was too early.  
**[0:36:37-0:36:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:36:37):**  It didn't really take off.  
**[0:36:38-0:36:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:36:38):**  Like it was a few people only scanned it.  
**[0:36:40-0:36:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:36:40):**  It wasn't enough to actually start a movement.  
**[0:36:42-0:36:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:36:42):**  But maybe now, 10 years later, we are in a different space.  
**[0:36:46-0:36:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:36:46):**  How I see this, it's not only the consumers.  
**[0:36:49-0:36:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:36:49):**  It's also for the retailers.  
**[0:36:50-0:36:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:36:50):**  It's for everyone.  
**[0:36:51-0:36:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:36:51):**  I mean, for me, what is important is to have transparency on the full value chain.  
**[0:36:55-0:36:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:36:55):**  Then myself, I'm not a campaigner.  
**[0:36:57-0:36:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:36:57):**  I mean, I cannot spend my time.  
**[0:36:59-0:37:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:36:59):**  I don't have time to check the information.  
**[0:37:04-0:37:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:37:04):**  But you're saying then that the retailer now doesn't know, doesn't have that transparency.  
**[0:37:09-0:37:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:37:09):**  I think many people now know that actually you're a retailer.  
**[0:37:12-0:37:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:37:12):**  Exactly.  
**[0:37:13-0:37:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:37:13):**  I mean, it's like the blockchain system, you don't know who will control, but it's like  
**[0:37:18-0:37:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:37:18):**  blockchain.  
**[0:37:19-0:37:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:37:19):**  You have access to the information that is inviolable.  
**[0:37:22-0:37:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:37:22):**  So you cannot cheat and sell everybody from consumers, retailers, NGOs.  
**[0:37:29-0:37:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:37:29):**  I mean, everybody can react by saying, well, OK, there is a problem there.  
**[0:37:34-0:37:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:37:34):**  And it should be massified to work.  
**[0:37:37-0:37:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:37:37):**  And I mean, it's not necessarily for me, the consumer that need to check everything.  
**[0:37:42-0:37:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:37:42):**  I mean, you have no time to do that.  
**[0:37:44-0:37:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:37:44):**  But by having transparency and access to the information, then yes, it's like blockchain  
**[0:37:49-0:37:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:37:49):**  for me.  
**[0:37:50-0:37:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:37:50):**  It's a system that will auto control, auto control and favor good practices and penalize  
**[0:37:57-0:37:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:37:57):**  negative practices.  
**[0:37:58-0:38:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:37:58):**  Yeah, I think it might be a shock to many that because of so many intermediaries, also  
**[0:38:03-0:38:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:38:03):**  many retailers and brands don't really know at the moment where the end farm was or where  
**[0:38:09-0:38:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:38:09):**  the end where their cacao beans are produced, which you would imagine that for a risk perspective,  
**[0:38:14-0:38:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:38:14):**  etc., they would know.  
**[0:38:15-0:38:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:38:15):**  But actually, because of so many steps in between, it's not really clear if the coffee  
**[0:38:20-0:38:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:38:20):**  was grown in Nicaragua or somewhere else or even in Nicaragua, where exactly.  
**[0:38:24-0:38:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:38:24):**  And that kind of traceability is already fundamental if you're running a coffee company, let alone  
**[0:38:28-0:38:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:38:28):**  if you're the consumer.  
**[0:38:29-0:38:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:38:29):**  But also for the coffee company, it makes a lot of sense.  
**[0:38:32-0:38:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:38:32):**  And it's good to rely on the good habits of the consumers.  
**[0:38:37-0:38:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:38:37):**  But I believe it's not enough.  
**[0:38:39-0:38:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:38:39):**  And that's where I mean, in the end, there should be half regulation and to say if you  
**[0:38:44-0:38:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:38:44):**  want to market coffee, you have to prove that your coffee is not associated to deforestation.  
**[0:38:50-0:38:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:38:50):**  In the end, you ok, consumer habits is good, but in the end, there should be some regulation  
**[0:38:57-0:38:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:38:57):**  about that.  
**[0:38:58-0:39:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:38:58):**  I want to thank you so much for your time today.  
**[0:39:02-0:39:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:39:02):**  And definitely we'll be checking in soon in a couple of months on the new initiative.  
**[0:39:06-0:39:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:39:06):**  I'm not going to call it a fund on the new vehicle or new approach or whatever, whatever  
**[0:39:11-0:39:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:39:11):**  shape and form it will take.  
**[0:39:12-0:39:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:39:12):**  But I'm very curious to unpack and to see what you are doing differently, obviously,  
**[0:39:16-0:39:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:39:16):**  and that's what you've learned, etc.  
**[0:39:18-0:39:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:39:18):**  But thank you so much for the current overview of what the Moringa fund is as we're speaking  
**[0:39:23-0:39:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:39:23):**  in October 2021.  
**[0:39:24-0:39:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:39:24):**  Thank you very much for our exchange.

**[0:40:24-0:40:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:40:24):**  Dear friends of the podcast, I'm super excited to share with you the online video course  
**[0:40:28-0:40:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:40:28):**  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[0:40:32-0:40:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:40:32):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  
**[0:40:36-0:40:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:40:36):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[0:40:38-0:40:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:40:38):**  After a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of audio asking the question  
**[0:40:42-0:40:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:40:42):**  how to put money to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011  
**[0:40:47-0:40:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:40:47):**  and recording this podcast since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  
**[0:40:52-0:40:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:40:52):**  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  
**[0:40:54-0:40:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:40:54):**  How have we built our decision making framework?  
**[0:40:57-0:40:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:40:57):**  What to focus on with the podcast?  
**[0:40:59-0:41:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:40:59):**  How have we picked interviewees?  
**[0:41:02-0:41:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:41:02):**  What questions should you ask?

**[0:42:07-0:42:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:42:07):**  So what is this course?  
**[0:42:08-0:42:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:42:08):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  
**[0:42:15-0:42:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:42:15):**  so you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:42:17-0:42:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:42:17):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:42:22-0:42:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:42:22):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:42:27-0:42:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:42:27):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[0:42:32-0:42:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:42:32):**  if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:42:34-0:42:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:42:34):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:42:38-0:42:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:42:38):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:42:42-0:42:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:42:42):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:42:47-0:42:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:42:47):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:42:48-0:42:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:42:48):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:42:50-0:42:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:42:50):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:42:53-0:42:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:42:53):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:42:56-0:42:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:42:56):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:42:58-0:43:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:42:58):**  Before making any investment please find professional investment advice.  
**[0:43:03-0:43:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/clement-chenost#t=0:43:03):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking.

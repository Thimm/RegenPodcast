**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/01/allan-savory/#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/01/allan-savory/#t=0:00:14):**  So I'm here at Grantwell doing a short podcast at Grantwell Shorts with Alan Savery.  
**[0:00:19-0:00:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/01/allan-savory/#t=0:00:19):**  And I would love to know Alan, what would be your not advice or investment advice, but  
**[0:00:24-0:00:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/01/allan-savory/#t=0:00:24):**  your idea to for impact investors to get active in the regenerative agriculture and food space?  
**[0:00:29-0:00:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/01/allan-savory/#t=0:00:29):**  I really don't know the answer to that question.  
**[0:00:32-0:00:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/01/allan-savory/#t=0:00:32):**  I'm serious.  
**[0:00:34-0:00:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/01/allan-savory/#t=0:00:34):**  Because how do you invest in changing policy?  
**[0:00:39-0:00:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/01/allan-savory/#t=0:00:39):**  Because the number one essential thing if we're going to address global desertification  
**[0:00:47-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/01/allan-savory/#t=0:00:47):**  and climate change and the tremendous damage that mainstream agriculture is doing.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/01/allan-savory/#t=0:00:54):**  As I've been talking here, I've explained why I believe that agriculture as we're doing  
**[0:00:59-0:01:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/01/allan-savory/#t=0:00:59):**  it today is the most destructive industry ever in the history of mankind, even more  
**[0:01:05-0:01:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/01/allan-savory/#t=0:01:05):**  so than coal and oil.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/01/allan-savory/#t=0:01:07):**  Now, where do you invest in changing that when what you need to do is to change public  
**[0:01:13-0:01:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/01/allan-savory/#t=0:01:13):**  opinion so that the public is insisting that our governments and environmental organizations,  
**[0:01:20-0:01:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/01/allan-savory/#t=0:01:20):**  et cetera, no longer develop policies in a reductionist way that they do, that they develop  
**[0:01:26-0:01:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/01/allan-savory/#t=0:01:26):**  them in a national holistic context, holistically?  
**[0:01:31-0:01:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/01/allan-savory/#t=0:01:31):**  That addresses the cause of the problem, because the problem is not being caused by livestock,  
**[0:01:38-0:01:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/01/allan-savory/#t=0:01:38):**  coal, and oil, as society has told.  
**[0:01:42-0:01:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/01/allan-savory/#t=0:01:42):**  Those are resources.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/01/allan-savory/#t=0:01:43):**  They cannot cause the problem.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/01/allan-savory/#t=0:01:45):**  The problem is 100% certainty due to management that is reductionist and policies.  
**[0:01:53-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/01/allan-savory/#t=0:01:53):**  If I was an investor and I had a billion dollars to invest, I would invest it in a creative  
**[0:02:00-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/01/allan-savory/#t=0:02:00):**  group of people who helped me change policy so that policy became holistic and we could  
**[0:02:07-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/01/allan-savory/#t=0:02:07):**  solve these problems.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/01/allan-savory/#t=0:02:09):**  Because unless you address the cause of the problem, you have no hope of success.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/01/allan-savory/#t=0:02:14):**  Anything else they invest in could make them feel good, and it may make money, but at the  
**[0:02:20-0:02:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/01/allan-savory/#t=0:02:20):**  end of the day, we will lose the war.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/01/allan-savory/#t=0:02:23):**  Global climate change will continue.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/01/allan-savory/#t=0:02:25):**  Any serious investor, and at the moment, there is no serious investment at all in addressing  
**[0:02:32-0:02:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/01/allan-savory/#t=0:02:32):**  the cause of climate change.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/01/allan-savory/#t=0:02:35):**  I would really not know how to answer your question other than that, and would rather  
**[0:02:40-0:02:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/01/allan-savory/#t=0:02:40):**  sit with them and say, here are the realities, how do you as investors believe you could  
**[0:02:47-0:02:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/01/allan-savory/#t=0:02:47):**  help us solve this problem?  
**[0:02:48-0:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/01/allan-savory/#t=0:02:48):**  Perfect.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/01/allan-savory/#t=0:02:49):**  Thank you so much.

**[0:03:03-0:03:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/01/allan-savory/#t=0:03:03):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[0:03:05-0:03:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/01/allan-savory/#t=0:03:05):**  After 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question how to put money  
**[0:03:09-0:03:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/01/allan-savory/#t=0:03:09):**  to work in regenerating soils, and I've been following this space since 2011 and recording

**[0:03:59-0:04:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/01/allan-savory/#t=0:03:59):**  And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office

**[0:04:12-0:04:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/01/allan-savory/#t=0:04:12):**  No.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/01/allan-savory/#t=0:04:13):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/01/allan-savory/#t=0:04:16):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you and I'm very aware  
**[0:04:21-0:04:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/01/allan-savory/#t=0:04:21):**  that among the listeners of this podcast we have people with very different means.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/01/allan-savory/#t=0:04:25):**  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means, to  
**[0:04:31-0:04:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/01/allan-savory/#t=0:04:31):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/01/allan-savory/#t=0:04:33):**  Thank you.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/01/allan-savory/#t=0:04:34):**  So what is this course?  
**[0:04:36-0:04:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/01/allan-savory/#t=0:04:36):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes, plus PDF slides  
**[0:04:42-0:04:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/01/allan-savory/#t=0:04:42):**  so you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/01/allan-savory/#t=0:04:44):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:04:49-0:04:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/01/allan-savory/#t=0:04:49):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:04:54-0:04:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/01/allan-savory/#t=0:04:54):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find, or what kind of investors you could  
**[0:04:59-0:05:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/01/allan-savory/#t=0:04:59):**  find if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/01/allan-savory/#t=0:05:01):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:05:06-0:05:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/01/allan-savory/#t=0:05:06):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/01/allan-savory/#t=0:05:10):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/01/allan-savory/#t=0:05:14):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:05:15-0:05:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/01/allan-savory/#t=0:05:15):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/01/allan-savory/#t=0:05:17):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/01/allan-savory/#t=0:05:20):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/01/allan-savory/#t=0:05:23):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/01/allan-savory/#t=0:05:25):**  Before making any investment please find professional investment advice.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/01/allan-savory/#t=0:05:31):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking, click on

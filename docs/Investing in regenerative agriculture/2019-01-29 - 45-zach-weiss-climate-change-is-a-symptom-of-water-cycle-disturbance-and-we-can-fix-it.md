**[0:00:18-0:00:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:00:18):**  water might be more important than CO2.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:00:21):**  Enjoy!  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:00:22):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture, investing as if  
**[0:00:27-0:00:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:00:27):**  the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:29-0:00:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:00:29):**  Today I'm going to show you how to learn more about how to put money to work in regenerative  
**[0:00:36-0:00:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:00:36):**  agriculture, soil, people, local communities, and ecosystems while making an appropriate  
**[0:00:41-0:00:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:00:41):**  and fair return.  
**[0:00:43-0:00:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:00:43):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:45-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:00:45):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:00:49-0:00:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:00:49):**  our land, grow our food, and what we eat.  
**[0:00:52-0:00:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:00:52):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers, start paying much more  
**[0:00:57-0:01:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:00:57):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:01-0:01:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:01:01):**  In March last year, we launched our Patreon community to make it easy for fans to support  
**[0:01:05-0:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:01:05):**  our work.

**[0:01:25-0:01:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:01:25):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:26-0:01:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:01:26):**  Welcome to the podcast.  
**[0:01:27-0:01:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:01:27):**  I'm Koon Vassai and your host today I'm joined by Zach Wise of Elemental Ecosystems, working  
**[0:01:32-0:01:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:01:32):**  on water retention landscapes.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:01:34):**  Welcome Zach.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:01:35):**  Thanks so much for having me.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:01:36):**  Glad to be here.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:01:37):**  So to start with a personal question, which I always love to do is what brings you to  
**[0:01:41-0:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:01:41):**  soil agriculture, in this case, water cycles?  
**[0:01:45-0:01:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:01:45):**  For me, it was a really deep and profound love for nature.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:01:49):**  And I always wanted to find something where I was working in nature outside as much as  
**[0:01:54-0:01:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:01:54):**  possible.  
**[0:01:56-0:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:01:56):**  And how to help people connect better with nature and a real logical place to start is  
**[0:02:02-0:02:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:02:02):**  food and water because it's something that every human needs and ingest many times a  
**[0:02:08-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:02:08):**  day.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:02:09):**  And that's our most direct and immediate connection to nature and to the landscape.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:02:13):**  It's funny as you were talking about it, I actually took a sip of water and realized  
**[0:02:17-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:02:17):**  how profound it was.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:02:19):**  I think we're going to talk a lot about water in this episode, much more than I've talked  
**[0:02:22-0:02:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:02:22):**  in others.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:02:23):**  We're connected by Judith T. Swartz, who also talks a lot about water and is still one of  
**[0:02:27-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:02:27):**  the most listened to episodes of this podcast.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:02:30):**  I will definitely link that one below.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:02:33):**  So let's talk a bit about, I mean, I briefly touched upon water cycles.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:02:39):**  What are water cycles?  
**[0:02:40-0:02:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:02:40):**  What's the difference between a full and a half water cycle?  
**[0:02:43-0:02:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:02:43):**  Let's get a bit into water, so to speak.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:02:47):**  Yeah.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:02:48):**  So if you think water is really moving through the landscape, it's moving through the air,  
**[0:02:53-0:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:02:53):**  it's moving through the ground, and it's constantly in motion.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:02:58):**  And so the full healthy water cycle is forests that are seeding the moisture in the air,  
**[0:03:05-0:03:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:03:05):**  causing clouds and then precipitation.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:03:08):**  That phase change draws in more precipitation and so you have this pump, it's called the  
**[0:03:14-0:03:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:03:14):**  biotic pump, where the living ecosystems of the continents actually draw moisture from  
**[0:03:21-0:03:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:03:21):**  the oceans, from the evaporation inland to the different continents.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:03:26):**  And so that's what we call the full or the natural water cycle.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:03:30):**  Now the half water cycle is the increasingly disturbed water cycle.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:03:36):**  And so it's a water cycle of extremes where the landscape is cleared.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:03:41):**  So for one, the water that used to infiltrate runs off quickly downstream, leading to flooding,  
**[0:03:49-0:03:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:03:49):**  but then followed by drought, and in the worst cases, fire, because the landscape is not  
**[0:03:54-0:03:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:03:54):**  being recharged with the water, it's being desiccated.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:03:58):**  And so that, to a very long extreme, we're now in this situation where humans have desertified  
**[0:04:06-0:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:04:06):**  one third of Earth's land in the last 10,000 years.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:04:10):**  And that's from modification of the surface cover, resulting in modification of the precipitation  
**[0:04:16-0:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:04:16):**  and the climate.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:04:18):**  And obviously, every farmer will tell you water is very, very important.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:04:22):**  But it's not something we talk about a lot.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:04:25):**  And usually it's about either irrigation, or it's a weather discussion, like we're waiting  
**[0:04:30-0:04:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:04:30):**  for the clouds to come etc.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:04:31):**  But you're saying there's a much more direct connection between soil, what's on and in  
**[0:04:37-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:04:37):**  the soil and actually the water cycle.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:04:39):**  Yeah, and we have much more control over it than people think.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:04:44):**  That's gonna be the next point.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:04:45):**  Like there's not something we just sit on the land, wait and hope and maybe dig a very  
**[0:04:50-0:04:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:04:50):**  deep well and start irrigating.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:04:51):**  There's much more we can do, right, as land users and owners.  
**[0:04:55-0:04:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:04:55):**  Exactly.  
**[0:04:56-0:05:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:04:56):**  And if you think water is the ultimate capital of any farmer,  
**[0:05:00-0:05:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:05:00):**  Which is great, because mainly on this podcast, everybody keeps saying soil, soil, soil, you're  
**[0:05:04-0:05:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:05:04):**  saying water is the ultimate capital.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:05:06):**  Can you explain?  
**[0:05:07-0:05:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:05:07):**  Well, water is life.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:05:09):**  70% of all life is water.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:05:11):**  And without water, there is no life.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:05:15):**  And so it's the element upon which life builds.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:05:19):**  We're carbon based life, but the living component of us is water.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:05:24):**  We're mostly water, all life is mostly water.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:05:27):**  So the soils are very important.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:05:30):**  But without the water, there's no place for anything to even start taking place.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:05:36):**  And so when you say there's much more that we can do, even if I'm maybe not owning the  
**[0:05:42-0:05:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:05:42):**  full landscape, and I can imagine, okay, maybe I can work on a landscape scale, you're working  
**[0:05:47-0:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:05:47):**  on smaller scale projects, bigger scale projects, what are some things you advise or you actually  
**[0:05:54-0:06:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:05:54):**  you work on with your clients that they can do on the land to help maybe restore part  
**[0:06:00-0:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:06:00):**  of the water cycle so we get closer to the full one again?  
**[0:06:03-0:06:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:06:03):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:06:04):**  And you brought up a really good point earlier.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:06:07):**  A lot of times people are talking about water, but we're never talking about this natural  
**[0:06:11-0:06:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:06:11):**  water management.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:06:13):**  We're talking about more extractive water use, how to set up irrigation, how to move  
**[0:06:19-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:06:19):**  water around with these large centralized water systems.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:06:23):**  And so what we're creating is decentralized water retention landscapes.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:06:28):**  So where water is being held at different points all throughout the landscape.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:06:32):**  And what this does is it makes it so that your irrigation is underground, your landscape  
**[0:06:37-0:06:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:06:37):**  is sub irrigated.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:06:39):**  So you don't need to apply all that energy to move the water, but you're also in this  
**[0:06:44-0:06:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:06:44):**  very long term vision with the water, where the actions you're doing in this year are  
**[0:06:51-0:06:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:06:51):**  going to be felt for the next century.  
**[0:06:55-0:06:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:06:55):**  It's going to take a little bit of time and inertia to really start seeing the results,  
**[0:06:59-0:07:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:06:59):**  but then they're going to really start growing.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:07:02):**  And you see it all over, if you take a landscape that is in this half broken water cycle, where  
**[0:07:09-0:07:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:07:09):**  it's a cycle of flood followed by drought, and then you balance that out, and you make  
**[0:07:15-0:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:07:15):**  it so that there is consistent year round water, the result is just incredible.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:07:21):**  You literally see life come back to the landscape.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:07:24):**  And so once this transition has taken place, it's very apparent for people to see how big  
**[0:07:30-0:07:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:07:30):**  of an impact this has.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:07:32):**  But a lot of times the techniques are, we're creating beaver mimicry structures, there's  
**[0:07:38-0:07:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:07:38):**  water retention ponds along different waterways.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:07:42):**  And they're pretty small interventions, but that really have a big impact on not only  
**[0:07:48-0:07:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:07:48):**  the immediate site, but the surrounding area as well.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:07:51):**  Yeah, I'm going to ask you to make it concrete, as I'm sure a lot of people think, yeah, of  
**[0:07:55-0:07:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:07:55):**  course, water is super important, but I'm on a piece of land or I'm in a continent or  
**[0:07:59-0:08:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:07:59):**  part of a continent where it's very dry, or we have only have rains for a certain amount  
**[0:08:04-0:08:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:08:04):**  of time, etc.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:08:05):**  Can you talk about a concrete project you've worked on with your company, where and as  
**[0:08:11-0:08:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:08:11):**  we're on audio, not visual and not video, can you make it as visual as possible, like  
**[0:08:15-0:08:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:08:15):**  the before and after?  
**[0:08:16-0:08:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:08:16):**  What did you find when you started working with a client?  
**[0:08:19-0:08:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:08:19):**  And how is it going now, as an example?  
**[0:08:22-0:08:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:08:22):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:08:23):**  So those are actually the situations where these techniques deliver the best results  
**[0:08:29-0:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:08:29):**  in landscapes, where they have this really extreme seasonality of precipitation.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:08:36):**  I'm thinking of several.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:08:38):**  But for example, one in Mexico, it's on a mesa, and there's no water source on the mesa.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:08:44):**  So no one lives on the mesa year round, and fires come through every year, and it gets  
**[0:08:49-0:08:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:08:49):**  so bone dry that it's basically uninhabitable.  
**[0:08:55-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:08:55):**  But we created a couple of water retention structures, and now this first year, even  
**[0:09:02-0:09:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:09:02):**  though they had really low rainfall, basically no precipitation for their normal, they still  
**[0:09:08-0:09:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:09:08):**  have water.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:09:09):**  Now, the water retention features aren't full because of that off year, but they're the  
**[0:09:14-0:09:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:09:14):**  only person on the mesa with water.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:09:16):**  And so that's, you know, it opens up a lot of avenues.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:09:19):**  Now you can start to have animals, you can start to have tree crops.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:09:23):**  This isn't a place where it's so dry.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:09:25):**  It's deciduous because of how dry it is.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:09:27):**  It gets too dry for the trees to hold on to their leaves.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:09:30):**  And if you return water to that kind of landscape, you go from this brown, desiccant desert to  
**[0:09:38-0:09:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:09:38):**  literally a patch of oasis in the desert during the dry season.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:09:43):**  And in this landscape on this farm or this landowner, what kind of structures did you  
**[0:09:48-0:09:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:09:48):**  make?  
**[0:09:50-0:09:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:09:50):**  What kind of structures did you put in place?  
**[0:09:52-0:09:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:09:52):**  You mentioned they're quite small, but still to imagine them, what should we imagine?  
**[0:09:56-0:09:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:09:56):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:09:58):**  So these, we did two different water bodies, which were both about 25, 30 meters across.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:10:07):**  And then we did a series of terraces.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:10:09):**  So small, but not super small.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:10:11):**  Yeah.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:10:12):**  Yeah, small, but not super small.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:10:14):**  And always sized according to the rainfall and the climate.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:10:18):**  So in a dry, hot climate, you need deeper water bodies that are bigger to get you through.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:10:25):**  Whereas if you're in a climate where it's always raining, you can create a lot smaller  
**[0:10:28-0:10:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:10:28):**  interventions to get the same result.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:10:31):**  And it's important to notice that it's not just the water bodies, but it's a whole ecological  
**[0:10:36-0:10:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:10:36):**  system because the forests are a very important part.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:10:39):**  The animals are a very important part.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:10:41):**  And so on this farm, we created two water bodies.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:10:44):**  And then we created some of the terraces feeding into theirs.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:10:48):**  But those also create the framework for what in this case will be a silvopasture system  
**[0:10:54-0:11:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:10:54):**  where they have animals grazing in between the rows of trees on the terraces that are  
**[0:11:00-0:11:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:11:00):**  also directing the overflow water to the water bodies.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:11:05):**  So it will be a full integrated regenerative agriculture system, basically.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:11:10):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:11:11):**  But taking the water as the first design principle, the first, the main limiting factor or the  
**[0:11:16-0:11:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:11:16):**  main opportunity here.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:11:18):**  Exactly.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:11:19):**  And the first thing that you figure out and build upon.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:11:22):**  So another thing, I try and have my consultations be as quick as possible so that people aren't  
**[0:11:28-0:11:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:11:28):**  eating a lot of their money in the design of the project, but we're actually putting  
**[0:11:32-0:11:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:11:32):**  the money into the implementation.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:11:34):**  And so really, in those short consultations, what we lay out is the water framework.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:11:40):**  And then from that, everything else becomes very clear.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:11:43):**  Because once you realize, here's where we can hold water, here's where we can have water,  
**[0:11:47-0:11:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:11:47):**  and here's where we can move it, that defines the rest of your operation.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:11:51):**  Yeah, and I think it's a nice bridge to a part about your company.  
**[0:11:55-0:11:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:11:55):**  So can you explain a bit when you got started with elemental ecosystems?  
**[0:11:59-0:12:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:11:59):**  How many people you are?  
**[0:12:01-0:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:12:01):**  What's your typical customer?  
**[0:12:03-0:12:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:12:03):**  And then what many questions in one I know.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:12:05):**  And what's the typical process look like?  
**[0:12:07-0:12:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:12:07):**  I mean, you mentioned a short consultation and then practice.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:12:10):**  But since when are you operating as a company?  
**[0:12:12-0:12:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:12:12):**  Yeah.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:12:13):**  So I started a business doing this kind of work in 2010.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:12:19):**  And then I rebranded as elemental ecosystems in 2015, I believe.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:12:28):**  We're a team of four people now.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:12:30):**  And so the first step is that onsite consultation.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:12:33):**  And this is where we're looking at the goals of the people and the capabilities of the  
**[0:12:38-0:12:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:12:38):**  landscape.  
**[0:12:39-0:12:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:12:39):**  And how do we best harmonize those two things?  
**[0:12:42-0:12:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:12:42):**  What are the actual features or interventions that we might do?  
**[0:12:46-0:12:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:12:46):**  And then sometimes if there's a lot of travel involved, I'll go right from that consultation  
**[0:12:51-0:12:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:12:51):**  into implementation.  
**[0:12:53-0:12:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:12:53):**  But more often, we do that consultation, we figure out, okay, here's phase one, two, and  
**[0:12:59-0:13:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:12:59):**  three of the project.  
**[0:13:01-0:13:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:13:01):**  Here's an estimate for each, the right time of year to do it.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:13:04):**  And then we actually come back and implement the project.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:13:07):**  For a lot of people, we're doing one big intervention that sets them up with what they need.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:13:14):**  And then for other clients, we're doing it over a course of years and continuing to add  
**[0:13:19-0:13:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:13:19):**  to it every year or every couple of years.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:13:22):**  And typical clients range from, there are always people who care about the earth and  
**[0:13:28-0:13:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:13:28):**  care about the impact that they're leaving.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:13:30):**  They range from farmers to organizations to education centers, agro-tourism, and family  
**[0:13:42-0:13:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:13:42):**  homesteads.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:13:43):**  And I'd say that's kind of the bulk of our main clientele fit into one of those niches.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:13:50):**  And when you look at the farmer side of things, can you name an example of, I mean, actually  
**[0:13:55-0:13:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:13:55):**  the farm you just mentioned?  
**[0:13:56-0:14:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:13:56):**  Is it usually the more extreme landscapes that reach out to you?  
**[0:14:02-0:14:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:14:02):**  Or are you also working in more moderate climates?  
**[0:14:05-0:14:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:14:05):**  I definitely am working in more moderate climates.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:14:08):**  It's because I trained with Sep.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:14:11):**  It's oftentimes the rocky steep ground that no one else knows.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:14:16):**  Sorry, who's Sep?  
**[0:14:17-0:14:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:14:17):**  Just for the...  
**[0:14:18-0:14:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:14:18):**  Yeah, so Sep Holzer, the agro rebel, is a really incredible lover of nature and practitioner.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:14:25):**  No, no, he is in Austria.  
**[0:14:27-0:14:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:14:27):**  Sorry, yeah, yeah, yeah.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:14:28):**  Now I've seen the terrorists, the extreme terrorists.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:14:31):**  I think there's a video somewhere.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:14:33):**  Yeah, exactly, exactly.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:14:35):**  And so he worked on a very rocky steep ground in Austria and created what is really an incredible  
**[0:14:42-0:14:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:14:42):**  farm there, the Krammaturhaf.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:14:44):**  And he's worked around the world, restoring deserts, doing all sorts of amazing things.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:14:49):**  And because he's known for turning crappy steep land into really productive farmland,  
**[0:14:56-0:15:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:14:56):**  I oftentimes end up in the very steep difficult projects where someone who didn't know what  
**[0:15:04-0:15:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:15:04):**  they're doing would get into a lot of trouble very quickly.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:15:07):**  And do you sometimes do the easier ones or it's always this tricky one?  
**[0:15:12-0:15:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:15:12):**  No, no, no, definitely a lot of the easier ones.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:15:15):**  And really it's incredible.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:15:17):**  A lot of times people don't realize what they have when they have a climate that rains an  
**[0:15:22-0:15:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:15:22):**  inch every month.  
**[0:15:24-0:15:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:15:24):**  They don't realize what a blessing that is.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:15:26):**  And so it's nice to be able to share that with them as well.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:15:29):**  And in terms of, I mean, climate change is definitely hitting, I can imagine how difficult  
**[0:15:33-0:15:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:15:33):**  it is for you as a designer and then a builder to, I mean, you look at historical models,  
**[0:15:39-0:15:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:15:39):**  I can imagine historical figures, but is it getting more difficult to predict how big  
**[0:15:45-0:15:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:15:45):**  a certain water retention system needs to be?  
**[0:15:48-0:15:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:15:48):**  It's becoming more extreme.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:15:50):**  So everywhere that I go this year, I've worked on five continents and every place it's the  
**[0:15:56-0:16:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:15:56):**  same story where the precipitation is more when it comes and it's less often.  
**[0:16:03-0:16:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:16:03):**  And so that's something that we design for.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:16:06):**  And because everything that we do, we're over engineering to a pretty significant extent,  
**[0:16:14-0:16:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:16:14):**  we're not sizing things for the hundred year flooding event.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:16:17):**  We're sizing things for bigger than that because we're starting to see that the hundred year  
**[0:16:22-0:16:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:16:22):**  flooding event is now the 50 year flooding event is now the 10 year flooding event.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:16:27):**  And so these are becoming more common.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:16:30):**  And normal.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:16:31):**  Yeah.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:16:32):**  And more intense.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:16:34):**  And so it's kind of the same pattern actually.  
**[0:16:37-0:16:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:16:37):**  So I wouldn't say it makes it more difficult.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:16:39):**  It just makes it more urgent.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:16:41):**  Yeah.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:16:42):**  Because obviously, I mean, that just creates a market much bigger for you guys and many  
**[0:16:48-0:16:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:16:48):**  others that to work on water retention landscapes.  
**[0:16:52-0:16:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:16:52):**  And it's really about balancing out those extremes.  
**[0:16:55-0:17:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:16:55):**  And so as those extremes get more severe, there's going to be more value in finding  
**[0:17:00-0:17:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:17:00):**  balance.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:17:01):**  Which is a nice bridge or a nice way of also looking at the energy landscape, obviously,  
**[0:17:07-0:17:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:17:07):**  as renewables are getting more and more common in many places, the grid or the storage or  
**[0:17:13-0:17:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:17:13):**  the retention is going to be more crucial.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:17:16):**  Absolutely, absolutely.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:17:18):**  And same thing, decentralizing it really makes a lot of sense.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:17:23):**  You start to have a lot of efficiency gains.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:17:25):**  If you think, for example, in Vermont, where I grew up in the United States, 90% of the  
**[0:17:31-0:17:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:17:31):**  energy produced is lost in transportation.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:17:36):**  And that's a pretty common figure for a large electrical municipality.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:17:41):**  And so the more you can decentralize that, you're losing less to transmission.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:17:46):**  And so you're actually creating more efficient systems.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:17:49):**  And the same is true with water.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:17:51):**  With these large centralized dams and reservoirs, they're actually very ecologically destructive  
**[0:17:57-0:18:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:17:57):**  and then very energy intensive to move the water around.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:18:01):**  Whereas if you create it in harmony with nature as a decentralized infrastructure, it's actually  
**[0:18:06-0:18:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:18:06):**  cheaper, it functions much better, and it's easier to build.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:18:11):**  And I'm imagining we're going the same route actually as the renewable energy space where  
**[0:18:16-0:18:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:18:16):**  it started really as a, I saw some prices in the 1990s of solar panels on roofs in Berlin  
**[0:18:22-0:18:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:18:22):**  or in Germany, which were really very different from the prices now.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:18:25):**  I mean, there's a huge change there.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:18:27):**  And from the investor point of view, you can now really put quite significant pieces of  
**[0:18:34-0:18:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:18:34):**  money to work.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:18:35):**  But you can also from the crowd investing perspective, small investors can get into  
**[0:18:38-0:18:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:18:38):**  the transition.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:18:39):**  I mean, there's a whole industry evolved around renewable energy in that transition.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:18:43):**  I hope to see the same in the land transition side and the regenerative ag space, but we're  
**[0:18:48-0:18:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:18:48):**  still very much earlier in that space.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:18:51):**  Have you seen a lot of change?  
**[0:18:52-0:18:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:18:52):**  I'm getting to my question.  
**[0:18:54-0:19:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:18:54):**  Like from 2015, when you rebranded it and now for your company as a, and also in the  
**[0:19:00-0:19:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:19:00):**  industry actually, have you seen, what have you seen change in the last years?  
**[0:19:04-0:19:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:19:04):**  You know, I just seen it grow and develop and it's every year there's more and more  
**[0:19:09-0:19:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:19:09):**  people contacting us every year, there's more and more projects that people want done.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:19:14):**  So I think it is certainly growing and more and more I'm seeing the scale and the size  
**[0:19:22-0:19:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:19:22):**  and the scope of projects is becoming bigger.  
**[0:19:25-0:19:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:19:25):**  Whereas I used to be working on a lot of 10 to 20 acre projects.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:19:29):**  Now it's a lot of hundreds to thousands of acres projects.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:19:34):**  And so the people with a lot of money and influence are really starting to see what's  
**[0:19:40-0:19:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:19:40):**  coming and starting to put in place the solution for the coming problems ahead of time.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:19:47):**  So for example, Sepp Holzer's son, Josef, is working for the oldest organic winery in  
**[0:19:55-0:20:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:19:55):**  Europe because they can see that all of these water shortages are coming and they want to  
**[0:20:00-0:20:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:20:00):**  get their water retention put in now before it really becomes dire.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:20:05):**  And so we are seeing more and more of these big players in the agricultural sector, but  
**[0:20:11-0:20:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:20:11):**  also other sectors.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:20:12):**  One of the areas that I look at a lot of potential here is in flood, fire and drought mitigation  
**[0:20:20-0:20:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:20:20):**  and prevention.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:20:21):**  If you think one fire in California is two and a half billion dollars of damage and these  
**[0:20:28-0:20:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:20:28):**  events are happening every year.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:20:31):**  And so it actually, even if you don't care at all about the environment, you don't care  
**[0:20:35-0:20:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:20:35):**  at all about the quality of the earth and the quality of the humans living on it, just  
**[0:20:40-0:20:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:20:40):**  from a financial standpoint, it's much cheaper to do this type of land management and to  
**[0:20:45-0:20:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:20:45):**  do preventative care instead of this heroic catastrophe remedy system that we have in  
**[0:20:53-0:20:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:20:53):**  place right now.  
**[0:20:55-0:21:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:20:55):**  And so I think more and more the large insurance conglomerates and the governments of the world  
**[0:21:00-0:21:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:21:00):**  are going to start buying into this work and becoming very interested.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:21:04):**  Stay Forever And when that happens, because I absolutely  
**[0:21:06-0:21:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:21:06):**  agree, it makes so much sense from an investor perspective and from a taxpayer perspective  
**[0:21:11-0:21:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:21:11):**  and from all of us, will we be ready?  
**[0:21:14-0:21:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:21:14):**  I mean, if an insurance company calls you now and says this part of California, huge,  
**[0:21:20-0:21:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:21:20):**  like not a few thousand, but actually a few hundred thousand of acres, is the sector,  
**[0:21:25-0:21:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:21:25):**  I'm asking you specifically because you're running a company in it, would you be ready  
**[0:21:28-0:21:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:21:28):**  to work on something so big with four people?  
**[0:21:32-0:21:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:21:32):**  You know, I would have to, I think the sector is not at all ready for that.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:21:38):**  I know one other person doing the same type of work that I'm doing to the same extent  
**[0:21:44-0:21:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:21:44):**  where they're actually doing implementation and follow through rather than just the planning.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:21:49):**  So there's a huge hole in the people who can actually implement this work and a huge  
**[0:21:56-0:21:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:21:56):**  dearth of them.  
**[0:21:58-0:22:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:21:58):**  But in a case like that, and I actually have a few cases like this where it's people  
**[0:22:02-0:22:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:22:02):**  with access to big investment funds, to large amounts of capital.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:22:08):**  And when one of these projects go through, I might have to put all my other projects  
**[0:22:13-0:22:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:22:13):**  on hold for a year or two and just focus on one of those to really get it to the place  
**[0:22:18-0:22:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:22:18):**  that it needs to be.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:22:20):**  And we do certainly need more and more people trained up in doing this kind of work.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:22:25):**  That's something there's a huge shortage of right now.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:22:29):**  Because that's one of the things you mentioned as one of the big differences, you actually  
**[0:22:32-0:22:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:22:32):**  do the implementation, not just the modeling, the scheduling, the design part of the work,  
**[0:22:38-0:22:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:22:38):**  but then actually the implementation, which I'm imagining often is quite intensive, labor  
**[0:22:43-0:22:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:22:43):**  intensive, meaning you have to either re-go to revisit the place.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:22:47):**  And that puts quite a constraint, obviously, on the company, how many projects you can  
**[0:22:52-0:22:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:22:52):**  do or how many hectares or acres you can manage.  
**[0:22:55-0:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:22:55):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:22:56-0:23:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:22:56):**  And if you think a lot of our projects, a bigger project is about one month.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:23:00):**  So we can only manage really, you know, right now we do maybe five or six big projects each  
**[0:23:08-0:23:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:23:08):**  year and then a lot of smaller ones in between.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:23:12):**  But you're exactly right.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:23:14):**  Each project takes its time and it's not a quick process.  
**[0:23:17-0:23:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:23:17):**  And it's a lot of different details that you need to know to really be able to implement  
**[0:23:24-0:23:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:23:24):**  the systems that you're putting in place well.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:23:26):**  I can see why the regenerative ag community and the permaculture community pushes itself  
**[0:23:33-0:23:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:23:33):**  towards design and consulting because there's no risk, there's no work, there's no, I mean,  
**[0:23:41-0:23:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:23:41):**  you need to have some rough skill set, but you don't really need a skill set.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:23:46):**  And so it's very easy to do.  
**[0:23:48-0:23:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:23:48):**  It's very easy to make a living doing that, but you're not actually creating restored  
**[0:23:55-0:24:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:23:55):**  landscapes and that's where we really need people putting their time and energy.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:24:00):**  And so what's your vision like a year from now or two years from now to get you and your  
**[0:24:06-0:24:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:24:06):**  company ready for a phone call like that from an insurance company or from a region or from  
**[0:24:13-0:24:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:24:13):**  a big client, a big landowner that says, okay, we listened to the podcast.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:24:18):**  Maybe I can play a small role in that.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:24:20):**  Or we saw your talk somewhere or we've seen your work and let's do that at scale.  
**[0:24:25-0:24:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:24:25):**  What would be the steps for you and for the sector to get to, in this case, a more serious  
**[0:24:30-0:24:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:24:30):**  and thus a more impactful phase?  
**[0:24:32-0:24:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:24:32):**  Yeah.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:24:33):**  And so I know how I'm approaching this and this is something we haven't really come out  
**[0:24:39-0:24:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:24:39):**  about yet, but basically I'm building a platform to franchise my business model.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:24:46):**  And so right now the typical setup for regenerative agriculture is if you, Cohen, want to learn  
**[0:24:53-0:25:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:24:53):**  what I'm doing, you pay me and you come and work on my farm for a couple of weeks or a  
**[0:25:00-0:25:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:25:00):**  couple of months and then I say goodbye, good luck, and you're off.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:25:05):**  And odds are you didn't learn enough in those couple of months to actually go forward and  
**[0:25:10-0:25:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:25:10):**  do this work.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:25:12):**  And so what I'm setting up for, we might trial our first group in 2020, but basically where  
**[0:25:20-0:25:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:25:20):**  I'm bringing in people, I'm training them for a couple of years working on the crew,  
**[0:25:26-0:25:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:25:26):**  working on these projects, and then they go and start their own business, their own franchise  
**[0:25:31-0:25:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:25:31):**  of elemental ecosystems within a given area.  
**[0:25:34-0:25:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:25:34):**  So I'd love to see an elemental ecosystems in every country on earth because there's  
**[0:25:40-0:25:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:25:40):**  the need for this work.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:25:42):**  We're getting contacted from people all over the place.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:25:45):**  There's tons of interest and that's without any marketing or any real outreach yet.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:25:50):**  And so how do we get people trained up where one, they know how to do the work, but then  
**[0:25:55-0:26:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:25:55):**  two, they also have the business infrastructure set up to really thrive because the people  
**[0:26:01-0:26:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:26:01):**  who want to be restoring landscapes, they're not the same people that know how to run their  
**[0:26:07-0:26:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:26:07):**  spreadsheets and know how to do all the different pieces.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:26:10):**  And so how do we create and build a platform where we can very quickly take someone, train  
**[0:26:16-0:26:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:26:16):**  them up to be an earth steward, and then put them into a role where they're functioning  
**[0:26:21-0:26:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:26:21):**  as a business entity, restoring landscape.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:26:24):**  And I mean, you're mentioning 2020, this is going to take a bit of time.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:26:30):**  What are your next steps for that?  
**[0:26:31-0:26:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:26:31):**  What is the main barrier at the moment?  
**[0:26:34-0:26:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:26:34):**  Right now, just so we have too many projects going on and I can't really dedicate my time  
**[0:26:40-0:26:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:26:40):**  to training those people.  
**[0:26:42-0:26:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:26:42):**  And so over this next year, I'll be trying to get it.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:26:46):**  My crew is very close to being able to do projects without me.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:26:49):**  And once we reach that point, then they can be working on projects and I can start this  
**[0:26:56-0:26:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:26:56):**  training model.  
**[0:26:57-0:27:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:26:57):**  And then also we're likely going to couple that with a project that will also be an ecological  
**[0:27:03-0:27:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:27:03):**  development.  
**[0:27:04-0:27:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:27:04):**  So as opposed to an intentional community, this would be an intentional neighborhood  
**[0:27:10-0:27:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:27:10):**  where everyone has their own home, their own place, but they own a share of the commons,  
**[0:27:16-0:27:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:27:16):**  which is this holistic farm with lakes to swim in and orchards and animals and all the  
**[0:27:22-0:27:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:27:22):**  pieces.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:27:24):**  And that would give us a canvas to basically set these people out working on and developing  
**[0:27:29-0:27:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:27:29):**  for the next handful of years so that I can keep taking in groups, working with them on  
**[0:27:35-0:27:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:27:35):**  that site as we develop that project and then pushing them out as they're ready onto projects  
**[0:27:40-0:27:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:27:40):**  around the world.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:27:42):**  Basically meaning it would be like a campus, not a university structure, but a physical  
**[0:27:47-0:27:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:27:47):**  place where, which both will be developed at the same time as a project, but then ends  
**[0:27:53-0:27:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:27:53):**  up being also the hub for all of this global organization.  
**[0:27:58-0:27:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:27:58):**  Exactly.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:27:59):**  And so we're just in the phases now of figuring out where exactly that should be, what exactly  
**[0:28:05-0:28:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:28:05):**  it should look like, all of those pieces and hopefully to really start in earnest on that  
**[0:28:11-0:28:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:28:11):**  project in the not 2019, but 2020.  
**[0:28:16-0:28:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:28:16):**  And when you look at, I mean, you for sure have been approached, I mean, you mentioned  
**[0:28:19-0:28:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:28:19):**  already with by investors.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:28:22):**  What is it normally that you tell them if you say, I want to invest in this space, what's  
**[0:28:25-0:28:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:28:25):**  your normal response to that?  
**[0:28:28-0:28:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:28:28):**  Usually people have a specific project and so it makes it quite clear.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:28:33):**  Okay.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:28:34):**  So they come with land or they come with a landscape.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:28:36):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:28:37):**  Even I'm thinking of someone I just recently spoke with who wants to set up models around  
**[0:28:44-0:28:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:28:44):**  the country and they have access to all this capital, but they always have a place that  
**[0:28:48-0:28:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:28:48):**  they want to start.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:28:50):**  And so it's, it's quite easy.  
**[0:28:52-0:28:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:28:52):**  It's rare that someone says, I want to stick a bunch of money into this, but they don't  
**[0:28:58-0:28:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:28:58):**  have a project in mind.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:28:59):**  Usually they have a landscape that they really love that was from their childhood or a place  
**[0:29:05-0:29:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:29:05):**  that they found and are really attached to.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:29:07):**  And so they don't want to just invest, but they want to invest in a place.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:29:12):**  And if they don't, let's say so hypothetically, somebody comes and says, I've got a million  
**[0:29:16-0:29:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:29:16):**  or 10 or a hundred and I want to have most impact on water.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:29:20):**  Let's make it an even more interesting one.  
**[0:29:22-0:29:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:29:22):**  What would you say to be the first step for them?  
**[0:29:25-0:29:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:29:25):**  Yeah, there are a couple of different options.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:29:28):**  So there are lots of projects that I work on that are more financially limited.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:29:33):**  So for example, this coming March, I'll work for a school in Bolivia where they're teaching  
**[0:29:40-0:29:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:29:40):**  the kids in La Paz about water retention landscapes, about agroforestry as part of their normal  
**[0:29:46-0:29:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:29:46):**  school curriculum.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:29:48):**  And so this is a project that's doing incredible work teaching hundreds of young Bolivians  
**[0:29:54-0:29:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:29:54):**  how to really cultivate and tend the landscape.  
**[0:29:57-0:30:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:29:57):**  Works like this can use financial support.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:30:00):**  They could really go a lot further with their efforts if they had someone and they don't  
**[0:30:06-0:30:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:30:06):**  even need millions of dollars.  
**[0:30:07-0:30:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:30:07):**  We're talking tens of thousands of dollars would deliver huge results for people like  
**[0:30:12-0:30:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:30:12):**  that.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:30:13):**  Now, another piece that I could see is in media development.  
**[0:30:18-0:30:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:30:18):**  So this would be in video content basically.  
**[0:30:21-0:30:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:30:21):**  Bringing all of this to light, letting people know what's gone on over the last handful  
**[0:30:27-0:30:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:30:27):**  of centuries on our planet with regards to water.  
**[0:30:31-0:30:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:30:31):**  And also that this isn't something that's happening that we have no control over.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:30:36):**  There are very specific things that we can do to be part of the solution.  
**[0:30:40-0:30:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:30:40):**  So that would be a separate project, obviously, but to how to a bit like it's happening with  
**[0:30:45-0:30:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:30:45):**  soil now, like in some niches, some corners to really put the spotlight on our role, the  
**[0:30:52-0:30:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:30:52):**  role of land use in the water cycles and what could be and not taking the current situation  
**[0:30:58-0:31:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:30:58):**  as fixed and we can never go back or forward.  
**[0:31:02-0:31:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:31:02):**  Absolutely, absolutely.  
**[0:31:04-0:31:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:31:04):**  And I think that there's actually this huge untold story here that when it comes out is  
**[0:31:09-0:31:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:31:09):**  going to be something that's actually immensely hopeful and is something that could also bridge  
**[0:31:14-0:31:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:31:14):**  the two sides because this is going to open up another discussion which we may not want  
**[0:31:21-0:31:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:31:21):**  to get into, but if you look at the first climate models, they assumed our impact on  
**[0:31:27-0:31:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:31:27):**  the water cycle was neutral and water vapor is the main greenhouse gas.  
**[0:31:33-0:31:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:31:33):**  It's the stuff we see coming out of the chimneys of the coal plants, etc.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:31:38):**  Right?  
**[0:31:39-0:31:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:31:39):**  Partly.  
**[0:31:40-0:31:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:31:40):**  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  
**[0:31:41-0:31:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:31:41):**  And there's also there's ways, so there's all this water vapor in the atmosphere.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:31:46):**  There are ways that can warm the planet and there are ways that it can cool the planet.  
**[0:31:51-0:31:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:31:51):**  And because it's so complicated, it's going back and forth between three different phases,  
**[0:31:57-0:32:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:31:57):**  there's a ton of energy in each of those transitions of phases and so it was too difficult to model.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:32:03):**  And so the first scientist looking at climate change just assumed that that was all neutral  
**[0:32:10-0:32:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:32:10):**  and that carbon was this big regulator of our climate.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:32:13):**  I think that that's totally false and actually if you look at any climatology textbook, it  
**[0:32:19-0:32:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:32:19):**  will tell you that most of the heat dynamics on Earth from 75 to 95 percent, depending  
**[0:32:25-0:32:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:32:25):**  on which numbers you're looking at, are determined by water vapor or water.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:32:30):**  And so we have on one side, we have climate change, which is this huge thing that's going  
**[0:32:35-0:32:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:32:35):**  to destroy us all, that we don't really have anything that we can do about, which now I  
**[0:32:40-0:32:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:32:40):**  actually think that that's a symptom of the severe water cycle disturbance that we're  
**[0:32:46-0:32:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:32:46):**  having.  
**[0:32:47-0:32:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:32:47):**  We can have a very real impact in that severe water cycle disturbance and it's something  
**[0:32:52-0:32:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:32:52):**  that is not invisible where this molecule that none of us can see is slowly heating  
**[0:32:58-0:33:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:32:58):**  up the Earth more and more.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:33:00):**  This is whether people have clean water to drink, this is whether your animals have water  
**[0:33:04-0:33:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:33:04):**  to survive, this is whether your crops have water to grow.  
**[0:33:08-0:33:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:33:08):**  And so it's very tangible and actionable and I think it could actually be a unifying force  
**[0:33:15-0:33:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:33:15):**  that we could all get behind because we all want to make sure that our children and future  
**[0:33:19-0:33:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:33:19):**  generations are going to have clean water.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:33:22):**  And so you're saying that by getting behind restoring water cycles, we stabilize quite  
**[0:33:29-0:33:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:33:29):**  a bit of the climate.  
**[0:33:30-0:33:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:33:30):**  Obviously we still have a huge thing to do with CO2 and the energy system etc. but through  
**[0:33:35-0:33:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:33:35):**  land use, nobody's against water retention, nobody's against clean water and it might  
**[0:33:41-0:33:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:33:41):**  be much easier and very impactful and much more concrete to work on over the next 20  
**[0:33:47-0:33:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:33:47):**  years or 30 years or 50 years.  
**[0:33:49-0:33:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:33:49):**  Exactly, exactly.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:33:50):**  If we want to start working on the heat dynamics on Earth, we need to work on the main forces  
**[0:33:56-0:33:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:33:56):**  and that is water.  
**[0:33:58-0:34:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:33:58):**  Which we need for every farmer on the planet.  
**[0:34:00-0:34:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:34:00):**  I mean the big problem is the temperature swings above or on his land or her land plus  
**[0:34:07-0:34:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:34:07):**  the water cycles that are either not coming or destroying everything in one swoop.  
**[0:34:12-0:34:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:34:12):**  Exactly, exactly.  
**[0:34:13-0:34:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:34:13):**  And so if you can balance out the climate, you're basically solving all the potential  
**[0:34:22-0:34:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:34:22):**  problems that climate change could create.  
**[0:34:25-0:34:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:34:25):**  And I would even say stabilizing the climate.  
**[0:34:28-0:34:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:34:28):**  And so I think we could go so far as to say if we actually want to address climate change,  
**[0:34:34-0:34:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:34:34):**  we can't do it without addressing the water cycle.  
**[0:34:37-0:34:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:34:37):**  When you have less water within the landscape, you're going to have less life within the  
**[0:34:43-0:34:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:34:43):**  landscape, which means you're going to have less carbon sequestration, which means you're  
**[0:34:47-0:34:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:34:47):**  naturally going to have higher CO2 levels, which actually increase the rate of growth  
**[0:34:53-0:34:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:34:53):**  in the plants.  
**[0:34:55-0:34:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:34:55):**  And so it wants to balance itself out.  
**[0:34:58-0:35:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:34:58):**  If we just stopped disturbing the water cycle, it would rebalance itself.  
**[0:35:03-0:35:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:35:03):**  Obviously, we stopped burning fossil fuels that have been underground for a really long  
**[0:35:09-0:35:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:35:09):**  time.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:35:10):**  But I've seen some very early research on, I think it was no-till farms in Montana, and  
**[0:35:17-0:35:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:35:17):**  they measured the temperature above it.  
**[0:35:19-0:35:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:35:19):**  And they measured the extreme, I think, rain events, and both of them dropped quite significantly.  
**[0:35:23-0:35:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:35:23):**  And it was just no-till.  
**[0:35:24-0:35:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:35:24):**  It was the real basics of, I would say, even conservation and agriculture.  
**[0:35:30-0:35:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:35:30):**  Have you seen any large-scale projects that take this really to another level that could  
**[0:35:35-0:35:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:35:35):**  serve as, look, you can actually stabilize.  
**[0:35:38-0:35:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:35:38):**  Let's start with the local climate, not the national or the continental climate, but you  
**[0:35:41-0:35:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:35:41):**  can start locally.  
**[0:35:42-0:35:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:35:42):**  You can stabilize the climate.  
**[0:35:44-0:35:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:35:44):**  You can get rid of these extreme water events and basically restart a whole cycle.  
**[0:35:51-0:35:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:35:51):**  What are the main projects at scale that you have seen or you're working on, maybe?  
**[0:35:56-0:35:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:35:56):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:35:57-0:36:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:35:57):**  And there are many different projects.  
**[0:36:00-0:36:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:36:00):**  So the lowest plateau in China is a great one.  
**[0:36:04-0:36:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:36:04):**  But even more so, Willie Smith's project in Borneo, by generating these agroforestry systems,  
**[0:36:11-0:36:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:36:11):**  they've measured a 10% increase in rainfall, not only for their place, but in the places  
**[0:36:19-0:36:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:36:19):**  downstream.  
**[0:36:20-0:36:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:36:20):**  And so that's basically restarting that biotic pump.  
**[0:36:23-0:36:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:36:23):**  I've seen the video of the clouds coming above the piece that reforested.  
**[0:36:30-0:36:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:36:30):**  It's quite an interesting site.  
**[0:36:31-0:36:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:36:31):**  I will try to link it below.  
**[0:36:32-0:36:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:36:32):**  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  
**[0:36:34-0:36:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:36:34):**  And then in India, a movement of peasant farmers has created just under 12,000 small water  
**[0:36:42-0:36:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:36:42):**  bodies.  
**[0:36:43-0:36:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:36:43):**  And they've actually restored five rivers as a consequence of that action, rivers that  
**[0:36:49-0:36:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:36:49):**  in the past never went dry, that were going dry, and now they run again year round and  
**[0:36:56-0:36:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:36:56):**  sometimes overflow.  
**[0:36:57-0:37:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:36:57):**  And they've restored 250,000 wells.  
**[0:37:01-0:37:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:37:01):**  And these are just peasant farmers with very little means creating small decentralized  
**[0:37:07-0:37:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:37:07):**  water retention, but really having a huge impact when you think they're restoring entire  
**[0:37:12-0:37:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:37:12):**  river systems.  
**[0:37:14-0:37:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:37:14):**  And what was the driver there?  
**[0:37:15-0:37:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:37:15):**  What was the, was it a complete bottom up project?  
**[0:37:20-0:37:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:37:20):**  Was it a region training them?  
**[0:37:22-0:37:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:37:22):**  How did that start compared to other states in India where it didn't start?  
**[0:37:26-0:37:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:37:26):**  It was a movement started by the people and carried out by the people and still carried  
**[0:37:32-0:37:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:37:32):**  out by the people.  
**[0:37:33-0:37:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:37:33):**  And they actually started this water Congress where the people started to have a say in  
**[0:37:37-0:37:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:37:37):**  how their water resources were used and managed.  
**[0:37:41-0:37:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:37:41):**  And this allowed them to start to manage them in a more long term sense.  
**[0:37:47-0:37:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:37:47):**  And they were able to achieve these results, not with some grand oversight or some grand  
**[0:37:52-0:37:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:37:52):**  vision to restore the whole area, but just people taking local initiative, looking at  
**[0:37:57-0:38:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:37:57):**  their water and how to really become stewards of their resources and their landscape.  
**[0:38:03-0:38:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:38:03):**  And what do you see as the biggest barriers to get this focus on water retention and water  
**[0:38:10-0:38:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:38:10):**  cycles to get it to a much higher level of impact?  
**[0:38:14-0:38:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:38:14):**  What are the two biggest barriers that you see or you work with daily?  
**[0:38:18-0:38:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:38:18):**  I think the biggest barrier is awareness.  
**[0:38:22-0:38:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:38:22):**  People just don't know that this is possible.  
**[0:38:24-0:38:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:38:24):**  I run into so many people and explain what I do and almost always they love it and they  
**[0:38:30-0:38:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:38:30):**  think it's great and they think, oh, why aren't we doing this everywhere?  
**[0:38:34-0:38:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:38:34):**  And it's just because people don't know that it's possible.  
**[0:38:37-0:38:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:38:37):**  The incredible things that we can achieve, once people see examples, they very quickly  
**[0:38:43-0:38:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:38:43):**  want to move down that path, quite urgently even.  
**[0:38:47-0:38:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:38:47):**  And so I think the barrier is just in understanding what's possible.  
**[0:38:51-0:38:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:38:51):**  And how have you been, I mean, you're extremely busy, you've been speaking at a number of  
**[0:38:55-0:38:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:38:55):**  occasions, there are quite some videos on YouTube.  
**[0:38:58-0:39:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:38:58):**  How have you been working on that apart from that?  
**[0:39:00-0:39:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:39:00):**  What's your, do you have in your franchising platform idea, but do you have a place for  
**[0:39:06-0:39:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:39:06):**  that awareness as it's so crucial, but of course it's not a very, it's not a business  
**[0:39:10-0:39:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:39:10):**  generating unit I can imagine for your small company?  
**[0:39:14-0:39:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:39:14):**  Yeah, that's very true.  
**[0:39:17-0:39:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:39:17):**  And it's definitely, it's not an income generator and this isn't a project we've really gone  
**[0:39:23-0:39:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:39:23):**  public with yet, but we have been for the last year now working on a documentary to  
**[0:39:29-0:39:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:39:29):**  bring all these points to light and it'll probably even launch a whole video series  
**[0:39:36-0:39:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:39:36):**  so that people can really start to find whatever they're looking for and really move into action,  
**[0:39:43-0:39:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:39:43):**  create an impact piece.  
**[0:39:45-0:39:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:39:45):**  And that's something where I've just been reinvesting the modest profits from my business  
**[0:39:51-0:39:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:39:51):**  into something like that because I see this as very important.  
**[0:39:56-0:40:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:39:56):**  It's not a project that's going to ever generate revenue for me, but if it creates that awareness,  
**[0:40:03-0:40:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:40:03):**  it's going to be well worthwhile.  
**[0:40:05-0:40:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:40:05):**  And when you speak of where people could invest their money, I think something like that is  
**[0:40:10-0:40:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:40:10):**  one of the very best things that people could invest in because it brings all the, you know,  
**[0:40:17-0:40:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:40:17):**  once you've seen the things that I've seen in some of these projects that Seph's done  
**[0:40:22-0:40:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:40:22):**  in Europe, you're driving through the desert and then you hit an oasis.  
**[0:40:27-0:40:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:40:27):**  And 10 years ago, that oasis was like desert.  
**[0:40:30-0:40:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:40:30):**  And once you see that, you can't help but want to create that everywhere.  
**[0:40:35-0:40:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:40:35):**  You can't unseen that.  
**[0:40:36-0:40:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:40:36):**  Exactly.  
**[0:40:37-0:40:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:40:37):**  Let's imagine there's a, I mean, you already mentioned a few things, but there's a room  
**[0:40:41-0:40:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:40:41):**  full of smart impact investors listening to this podcast and they're ready.  
**[0:40:48-0:40:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:40:48):**  They have a piece of land, of course they're going to do things on that, but they want  
**[0:40:50-0:40:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:40:50):**  to do more.  
**[0:40:51-0:40:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:40:51):**  They want to do more than their own farm gate and maybe the awareness piece isn't for them.  
**[0:40:56-0:41:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:40:56):**  What would be something they could do not on their land if they have investment capital  
**[0:41:00-0:41:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:41:00):**  available so not necessarily grants to get into?  
**[0:41:03-0:41:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:41:03):**  What do you see opportunities?  
**[0:41:04-0:41:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:41:04):**  Or maybe it's too early and we're not ready to accept investment to absorb and put money  
**[0:41:09-0:41:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:41:09):**  to work in restoring water cycles?  
**[0:41:11-0:41:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:41:11):**  No, I think there's definitely potential there.  
**[0:41:14-0:41:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:41:14):**  So if they don't have an immediate project, I think partnering with someone to help a  
**[0:41:20-0:41:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:41:20):**  farmer in need actually start to take these practices on.  
**[0:41:25-0:41:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:41:25):**  But an even bigger piece, there is a dire need to rewrite natural resource policy management.  
**[0:41:34-0:41:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:41:34):**  Dire, dire, dire.  
**[0:41:36-0:41:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:41:36):**  I can't tell you how often the things that I want to do are illegal and they're for a  
**[0:41:43-0:41:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:41:43):**  benefit of the immediate property and all the neighbors.  
**[0:41:47-0:41:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:41:47):**  It's a better use of the natural resources.  
**[0:41:50-0:41:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:41:50):**  The laws aren't intended to make these things illegal, but they're written in such a way  
**[0:41:54-0:41:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:41:54):**  that they do.  
**[0:41:56-0:41:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:41:56):**  They make the destruction illegal.  
**[0:41:58-0:42:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:41:58):**  Do you have an example?  
**[0:42:00-0:42:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:42:00):**  So for example, touching any water system in the US is illegal.  
**[0:42:05-0:42:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:42:05):**  People are not allowed to work with their water.  
**[0:42:07-0:42:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:42:07):**  Any flowing water through your landscape, you get in very big trouble for even creating  
**[0:42:12-0:42:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:42:12):**  a small decentralized water body along that.  
**[0:42:16-0:42:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:42:16):**  Now the regulations were written to keep developers from destroying wetlands and to keep sewage  
**[0:42:24-0:42:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:42:24):**  and all these bad atrocious things that yes need to be stopped, but it's very important  
**[0:42:29-0:42:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:42:29):**  that we start lobbying the governments of the world and start rewriting these laws so  
**[0:42:35-0:42:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:42:35):**  that people actually have control to steward their own resources and these projects that  
**[0:42:42-0:42:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:42:42):**  want to take place are actually allowed to.  
**[0:42:45-0:42:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:42:45):**  So for example, in Oregon where I have a lot of work, the wetlands permitting is so complicated  
**[0:42:54-0:43:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:42:54):**  that no one can get through it to create a wetlands and so they created this special  
**[0:43:00-0:43:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:43:00):**  easy permitting process.  
**[0:43:02-0:43:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:43:02):**  But the title of it, which is like the wetlands restoration permit, does not allow for the  
**[0:43:09-0:43:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:43:09):**  enhancement of wetlands.  
**[0:43:11-0:43:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:43:11):**  And so even when they make these interventions to try and make it easier, they put these  
**[0:43:16-0:43:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:43:16):**  big limiting constraints on it.  
**[0:43:19-0:43:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:43:19):**  And if we're destroying wetlands in one part, we need to be enhancing wetlands on the other  
**[0:43:24-0:43:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:43:24):**  to meet that same ecological function.  
**[0:43:27-0:43:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:43:27):**  And so it's really important that this short sighted thinking from the government starts  
**[0:43:31-0:43:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:43:31):**  to be rewritten.  
**[0:43:32-0:43:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:43:32):**  And so I'd love to see some impact investors invest in lobbyists to rewrite natural resource  
**[0:43:39-0:43:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:43:39):**  law and to give citizens the ability to properly steward their land.  
**[0:43:44-0:43:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:43:44):**  Stay Forever And would that be, I mean, that's my final  
**[0:43:46-0:43:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:43:46):**  question.  
**[0:43:47-0:43:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:43:47):**  If you could wave your magic wand and change one thing overnight in the agriculture or  
**[0:43:52-0:43:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:43:52):**  land use industry, what would you do?  
**[0:43:54-0:43:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:43:54):**  Oh, yeah, definitely the policy things without a doubt.  
**[0:43:59-0:44:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:43:59):**  I mean, short of changing huge amounts of landscape overnight, changing that policy  
**[0:44:05-0:44:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:44:05):**  piece would be huge.  
**[0:44:06-0:44:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:44:06):**  There are so many projects where we're doing less than we could because of policy, or we're  
**[0:44:12-0:44:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:44:12):**  changing what we're doing because of policy, not because of nature.  
**[0:44:17-0:44:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:44:17):**  And so if we could even just create some exceptions, where we know, okay, this work is direly necessary  
**[0:44:27-0:44:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:44:27):**  for watershed restoration, we're going to make some special exemptions, where some of  
**[0:44:31-0:44:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:44:31):**  these projects can get permitted very quickly.  
**[0:44:33-0:44:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:44:33):**  On other projects, for example, the permitting is going to cost more than the work.  
**[0:44:39-0:44:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:44:39):**  For building some water bodies in California, where this is so direly necessary, where people  
**[0:44:44-0:44:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:44:44):**  are dying in fires, and then everyone's being sued because of the fires, yet it's more expensive  
**[0:44:53-0:44:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:44:53):**  for the permitting than for the actual feature to actually put in place the solution.  
**[0:44:58-0:45:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:44:58):**  And so they've created an atmosphere where it can't be fixed because of the legal framework.  
**[0:45:03-0:45:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:45:03):**  And so if we could just overnight snap your fingers and fix all of that, that would be  
**[0:45:07-0:45:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:45:07):**  a huge move in the right direction.

**[0:48:44-0:48:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:48:44):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture

**[0:49:06-0:49:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:49:06):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:49:09-0:49:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:49:09):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:49:14-0:49:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:49:14):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:49:15-0:49:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:49:15):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:49:17-0:49:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:49:17):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:49:20-0:49:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:49:20):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:49:23-0:49:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/#t=0:49:23):**  It's also not investment advice.

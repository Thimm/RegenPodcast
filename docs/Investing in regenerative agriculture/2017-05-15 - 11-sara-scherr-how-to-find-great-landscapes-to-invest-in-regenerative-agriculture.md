**[0:00:12-0:00:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:16-0:00:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:00:16):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture, investing as if  
**[0:00:20-0:00:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:00:20):**  the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:00:21):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:26-0:00:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:00:26):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:00:31-0:00:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:00:31):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:00:36):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:38-0:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:00:38):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:00:42-0:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:00:42):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:00:44):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:00:49-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:00:49):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:00:54):**  Before we get started, I've been recording these interviews next to my day job and I  
**[0:00:58-0:01:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:00:58):**  will definitely continue to do so and release about an episode a month.  
**[0:01:02-0:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:01:02):**  But at the same time I would love to take this further, share more interviews, there  
**[0:01:06-0:01:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:01:06):**  are many more stories to share on investing in regenerative food and agriculture.  
**[0:01:10-0:01:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:01:10):**  More depth, improve the quality, maybe even doing some video series.  
**[0:01:15-0:01:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:01:15):**  So I started a Patreon community which makes it easy to support creators like myself.  
**[0:01:19-0:01:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:01:19):**  If these podcasts have been of value to you and if you have the means, I invite you to  
**[0:01:24-0:01:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:01:24):**  support me and make this happen.

**[0:01:31-0:01:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:01:31):**  And now, without further ado, the interview.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:01:35):**  Enjoy!  
**[0:01:36-0:01:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:01:36):**  Welcome to investing in regenerative agriculture, agriculture as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:01:40):**  In these interviews I am talking to people who are scaling up the sector either by increasing  
**[0:01:45-0:01:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:01:45):**  the influx of capital or by working on the ground to scale up the enterprises on the  
**[0:01:49-0:01:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:01:49):**  ground.  
**[0:01:50-0:01:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:01:50):**  Why regenerative agriculture?  
**[0:01:51-0:01:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:01:51):**  Because so many of the world current issues come together in this subject.  
**[0:01:55-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:01:55):**  From drought to water scarcity, climate change, social issues, hunger, obesity all have a  
**[0:02:00-0:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:02:00):**  connection to how we grow food and what we eat.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:02:03):**  You are going to listen to an interview with Dr. Sarah Scheer, founder and CEO of Ecoagriculture  
**[0:02:08-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:02:08):**  Partners.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:02:09):**  We talk about stranded assets.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:02:10):**  11 trillion of stranded assets are stuck in agriculture.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:02:14):**  We will talk about the importance of good landscape partnerships and how, as a smart  
**[0:02:18-0:02:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:02:18):**  impact investor, you can recognize partnerships that actually add value where all the stakeholders  
**[0:02:23-0:02:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:02:23):**  are involved and the need for new institutions to really get this movement to scale.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:02:28):**  Enjoy!  
**[0:02:29-0:02:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:02:29):**  So welcome to investing in regenerative agriculture, agriculture as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:02:33):**  I am Koen van Zeyen, the host of today.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:02:34):**  In the podcast of today we have Dr. Sarah Scheer, agricultural and natural resource economist,  
**[0:02:39-0:02:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:02:39):**  CEO and co-founder of Ecoagriculture Partners, plus author of many books and papers, for  
**[0:02:45-0:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:02:45):**  instance Scaling Up the Investment Finance for Integrated Landscape Management, where  
**[0:02:49-0:02:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:02:49):**  for the first time, at least I have read it there for the first time, people speak about  
**[0:02:53-0:02:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:02:53):**  the stranded assets in agriculture.  
**[0:02:55-0:02:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:02:55):**  So we are definitely going to ask more about that.  
**[0:02:57-0:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:02:57):**  Welcome Sarah!  
**[0:02:58-0:02:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:02:58):**  Thank you very much, Koen.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:02:59):**  It is a pleasure to be with you.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:03:00):**  And to start, as I like to start with a personal question, how did you end up in the regenerative  
**[0:03:06-0:03:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:03:06):**  ecological agriculture space?  
**[0:03:08-0:03:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:03:08):**  Well, I am one of those unusual people who has actually been interested in that question  
**[0:03:14-0:03:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:03:14):**  since I was about 19 years old.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:03:16):**  And I was doing some of my early field work in the rainforests of Costa Rica and looking  
**[0:03:21-0:03:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:03:21):**  at the kinds of agriculture that made sense and did not make sense in that kind of environment.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:03:26):**  That inspired me to go on to study agricultural economics and study agroforestry and natural  
**[0:03:33-0:03:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:03:33):**  resource management.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:03:34):**  So I have been looking at this question my whole life for a very long time, focusing  
**[0:03:39-0:03:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:03:39):**  on those areas where agronomists said it was hard or maybe we should not be doing agriculture  
**[0:03:44-0:03:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:03:44):**  in rainforests and dry lands and steep hillsides, particularly throughout the tropics.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:03:50):**  And I was so constantly looking at this relationship between agricultural production and livelihoods  
**[0:03:56-0:04:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:03:56):**  for farmers and the management of the soils and the water and the vegetation and the biodiversity  
**[0:04:04-0:04:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:04:04):**  and the places where they were working.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:04:06):**  So I did that work for a really long time.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:04:09):**  And I was a researcher also doing development work for about 25 years.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:04:16):**  In the year 2000, I got involved in several research projects that were looking globally  
**[0:04:22-0:04:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:04:22):**  at land use, trying to look at the relationship between agricultural production areas and  
**[0:04:27-0:04:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:04:27):**  important ecosystem services.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:04:30):**  And I found to my astonishment that the remote sensing data actually showed that the most  
**[0:04:36-0:04:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:04:36):**  important areas for biodiversity, for carbon sinks, terrestrial carbon sinks, for watershed  
**[0:04:45-0:04:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:04:45):**  management were actually in the prime agricultural areas of the world.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:04:50):**  And this was really quite a shock for me because I realized that the issues that I had been  
**[0:04:54-0:05:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:04:54):**  facing all those years in what they used to call marginal lands were actually just as  
**[0:05:01-0:05:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:05:01):**  true of our bread baskets and rice bowls.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:05:03):**  And that the way that we manage our agriculture in those places was absolutely central to  
**[0:05:09-0:05:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:05:09):**  long-term provisioning of water, to long-term conservation of biodiversity, wildlife, et  
**[0:05:15-0:05:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:05:15):**  cetera.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:05:16):**  So it really gave me a new look at things and realized that we need to be looking at  
**[0:05:21-0:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:05:21):**  agriculture not as something that is separate from environmental management, but as one  
**[0:05:28-0:05:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:05:28):**  of the most important tools that we have.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:05:31):**  And so then I thought, well, then the big challenge we face moving forward in this next  
**[0:05:35-0:05:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:05:35):**  generation is to find agricultural systems that are actually not just a little bit less  
**[0:05:41-0:05:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:05:41):**  bad for the environment, but are actually positively contributing to healthy watersheds,  
**[0:05:48-0:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:05:48):**  to wildlife habitat, to terrestrial climate change mitigation, et cetera.  
**[0:05:54-0:05:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:05:54):**  So that's what really sparked my interest in thinking about this issue, not only at  
**[0:05:58-0:06:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:05:58):**  the farm level, but at a much larger landscape scales.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:06:01):**  Yeah, I really like the not less bad, but more good metaphor definition.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:06:07):**  I think it really captures a whole new paradigm almost of agriculture instead of really looking  
**[0:06:14-0:06:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:06:14):**  at making sure we do it in a way that it's maybe slightly less bad or cutting less trees,  
**[0:06:21-0:06:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:06:21):**  et cetera.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:06:22):**  We're looking at how do we bring back a lot of the biodiversity and use it as a huge tool.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:06:27):**  Have you seen a lot of change in the perception because you were for sure one of the first  
**[0:06:31-0:06:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:06:31):**  that started looking at that?  
**[0:06:33-0:06:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:06:33):**  In 2000 to maybe a few years ago and then a few years ago until now, were there really  
**[0:06:39-0:06:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:06:39):**  big changes in the perception of people and the responses in the companies you're working  
**[0:06:43-0:06:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:06:43):**  with, the organizations, et cetera?  
**[0:06:46-0:06:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:06:46):**  I think that one of the things that you've been seeing over the last decade is much wider  
**[0:06:51-0:06:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:06:51):**  recognition of the importance of environmental issues to agriculture.  
**[0:06:56-0:07:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:06:56):**  But I would say that the focus has been more of a preoccupation about the controlling the  
**[0:07:01-0:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:07:01):**  negative effects of agriculture on the environment.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:07:05):**  I think there's still not a very widespread recognition of just how important environmental  
**[0:07:11-0:07:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:07:11):**  management is to the productivity and long-term sustainability and resilience of production  
**[0:07:17-0:07:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:07:17):**  agriculture itself.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:07:19):**  I think that's to me the change in the mental model that we still need to see.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:07:25):**  It also means that people are then not being quite as creative at thinking about what those  
**[0:07:30-0:07:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:07:30):**  investments need to look like.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:07:33):**  They're not thinking about their agriculture investments within this broader context of  
**[0:07:38-0:07:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:07:38):**  what kinds of land uses and land management are actually surrounding them.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:07:43):**  To me, this is actually one of the big changes that has happened in just the last couple  
**[0:07:48-0:07:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:07:48):**  of years.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:07:49):**  One of the things that we've been doing at Ecoagriculture Partners for the last 15 years  
**[0:07:53-0:08:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:07:53):**  is to try to document and study and understand how are these integrated landscape management  
**[0:08:00-0:08:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:08:00):**  strategies work.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:08:02):**  We've documented with partners around the world more than 420 of these large-scale  
**[0:08:08-0:08:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:08:08):**  landscape partnerships where farmers and conservation organizations and local governments and social  
**[0:08:15-0:08:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:08:15):**  NGOs and nutrition folks, et cetera, have partnered together in landscapes where it  
**[0:08:21-0:08:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:08:21):**  was very clear that none of them working separately was going to address very serious issues of  
**[0:08:27-0:08:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:08:27):**  natural resource conflict or natural resource degradation and some of these other concerns  
**[0:08:32-0:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:08:32):**  that have been really arising all around the world.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:08:36):**  People have been doing this kind of work for quite some time.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:08:40):**  I think it was a bit of an unrecognized secret just how much these local situations were  
**[0:08:48-0:08:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:08:48):**  giving rise to new kinds of partnerships, new kinds of institutions to try to transform  
**[0:08:54-0:09:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:08:54):**  landscapes to become much more sustainable for all of the people that are living in them  
**[0:09:00-0:09:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:09:00):**  to produce all of the products that are needed and all of the ecosystem services and livelihoods  
**[0:09:04-0:09:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:09:04):**  that people in those landscapes need to have.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:09:08):**  What you had was very little recognition at the policy level and certainly very little  
**[0:09:13-0:09:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:09:13):**  recognition within the financial institutions.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:09:16):**  One quite remarkable thing is if you look at these 420 landscapes that we documented  
**[0:09:21-0:09:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:09:21):**  between 2013 and 2015 that had all been established for at least three years, they had platforms  
**[0:09:29-0:09:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:09:29):**  for negotiation among the stakeholder groups, they were developing action plans, et cetera.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:09:34):**  There was only a quarter of them had any agribusiness or food industry partners in them and other  
**[0:09:41-0:09:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:09:41):**  private sector actors.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:09:43):**  We were really quite surprised by this, particularly since the focus of all of these was on production  
**[0:09:48-0:09:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:09:48):**  agriculture landscapes.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:09:50):**  To not have private sector actors, apart from farmer organizations, those were very common  
**[0:09:56-0:09:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:09:56):**  in all of the landscapes.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:09:59):**  There was this surprising lack of business involvement.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:10:02):**  In Africa, it actually was only 8% of all the landscape initiatives that had business  
**[0:10:07-0:10:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:10:07):**  partners.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:10:08):**  You're saying, wait a minute, agriculture is basically a private sector business.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:10:12):**  How can it be that they've not been part of this?  
**[0:10:15-0:10:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:10:15):**  Why is that?  
**[0:10:16-0:10:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:10:16):**  Part of it simply was that in the minds of most companies, they want to focus on the  
**[0:10:23-0:10:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:10:23):**  farms they work in.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:10:25):**  They want to focus on their supply chains.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:10:28):**  All of the interventions that we think about, whether it's from a production point of view  
**[0:10:31-0:10:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:10:31):**  or even a sustainability point of view, were largely at the farm level and within supply  
**[0:10:35-0:10:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:10:35):**  chains.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:10:36):**  If you look at certification as a strategy, if you look at supply chain standards, et  
**[0:10:40-0:10:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:10:40):**  cetera, that is really the way the agricultural sector is largely structured.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:10:44):**  Also government entities involved in agriculture are structured really at those two levels,  
**[0:10:49-0:10:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:10:49):**  rather than at the larger landscape level.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:10:51):**  They weren't used to thinking about the problem as something that they needed to solve at  
**[0:10:57-0:10:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:10:57):**  the larger landscape scale.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:10:59):**  Obviously, they're not going to do anything.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:11:01):**  There's not a good business case for it.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:11:03):**  One of the things that to me has been the biggest change, you ask, over the last couple  
**[0:11:06-0:11:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:11:06):**  of years has been the burgeoning recognition by many of the actors in the agriculture production  
**[0:11:13-0:11:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:11:13):**  and food industry space that many of their most important sourcing regions are actually  
**[0:11:19-0:11:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:11:19):**  at risk and that it's going to be hurting the business.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:11:23):**  The most common risks are concerns about water access, water quality, and water security.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:11:30):**  You have brewing companies, for example, that all of a sudden are getting very interested  
**[0:11:35-0:11:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:11:35):**  in being involved with multi-stakeholder watershed management programs because they really need  
**[0:11:40-0:11:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:11:40):**  to ensure that for the next 50 years, there's good water sources.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:11:43):**  You have all of these companies that have made commitments to deforestation-free supply  
**[0:11:49-0:11:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:11:49):**  chains that have realized that it's not sufficient to do farm level certification if those farms  
**[0:11:55-0:12:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:11:55):**  that are supplying them are in the middle of forests where many other actors are continuing  
**[0:12:01-0:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:12:01):**  to do deforestation.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:12:03):**  They then have no credibility for their certification.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:12:07):**  Those groups are now starting to recognize that they need to partner with other actors  
**[0:12:11-0:12:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:12:11):**  in the landscape to try to have collaborative solutions to addressing deforestation.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:12:18):**  You also have companies that are seeing issues related to climate change and the need for  
**[0:12:24-0:12:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:12:24):**  climate change adaptation that also want to partner with other institutions to co-invest  
**[0:12:30-0:12:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:12:30):**  in some of the activities and programs and business models that will allow them to adapt  
**[0:12:37-0:12:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:12:37):**  more effectively to climate change.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:12:40):**  I think you're starting to see much more recognition about the potential business advantages of  
**[0:12:45-0:12:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:12:45):**  being part of these landscape partnerships, but at the same time, you have a really pretty  
**[0:12:52-0:12:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:12:52):**  start of the learning curve for everyone and how to make those partnerships actually be  
**[0:12:57-0:12:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:12:57):**  effective.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:12:58):**  And if you look at what has changed in the past few years, that suddenly at least a number  
**[0:13:03-0:13:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:13:03):**  of these groups in agriculture, either companies, processing companies, etc., started to look  
**[0:13:08-0:13:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:13:08):**  beyond their own farm or beyond their own supply.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:13:11):**  What has triggered that, let's look outside, beyond the gate of what I'm used to?  
**[0:13:16-0:13:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:13:16):**  I would say for most of them it is looking at business risks.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:13:20):**  They're seeing risks that they can't manage within the confines of their own company or  
**[0:13:25-0:13:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:13:25):**  their own supply chain.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:13:26):**  So I think that's the biggest one.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:13:28):**  And I guess say climate water, I think some of the community issues about establishing  
**[0:13:32-0:13:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:13:32):**  a long-term right to operate in places where there's many other actors that are competing  
**[0:13:38-0:13:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:13:38):**  for some of the same resources that are important for the companies.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:13:41):**  So I think that's part of what you're starting to see is a recognition of risk.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:13:45):**  There are some real far-sighted companies that are actually turning that on its head  
**[0:13:51-0:13:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:13:51):**  and are actually making commitments from the level of their board of directors that say  
**[0:13:56-0:14:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:13:56):**  we are committed to long-term sustainability in our operations and in our businesses.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:14:02):**  We see partnerships with other actors who share the resource base with us as actually  
**[0:14:09-0:14:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:14:09):**  being one of the core principles of our business.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:14:11):**  So I would say there's not too many of those yet, but you're actually starting to see it  
**[0:14:15-0:14:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:14:15):**  move from simply a risk analysis to a shifting of business models as something where they  
**[0:14:20-0:14:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:14:20):**  recognize that the long-term sustainability of the landscapes they're operating with and  
**[0:14:26-0:14:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:14:26):**  the economic, social and ecological health of the other actors in those landscapes actually  
**[0:14:31-0:14:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:14:31):**  are part of the plan for achieving success within their businesses.  
**[0:14:36-0:14:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:14:36):**  That's almost moving from a less negative, in this case risk, to a few that are actually  
**[0:14:41-0:14:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:14:41):**  seeing the positive potential almost from a risk management to actually this is full  
**[0:14:48-0:14:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:14:48):**  of opportunities if I'm doing it right, which isn't easy, but at least it's possible, which  
**[0:14:54-0:14:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:14:54):**  of course the 400 cases you've looked at, or at least a quarter that was involved with  
**[0:14:59-0:15:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:14:59):**  agriculture business have been showing.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:15:04):**  I think the other landscapes are desperately trying to engage businesses in the work and  
**[0:15:09-0:15:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:15:09):**  in many cases they haven't been successful to.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:15:11):**  One of the things that we've been working with is tools and methods and analyses that  
**[0:15:16-0:15:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:15:16):**  will help some of those existing landscape initiatives reach out to businesses and help  
**[0:15:21-0:15:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:15:21):**  them consider the business case for participating.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:15:25):**  We've also been trying to look at working with businesses to see how they can do their  
**[0:15:30-0:15:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:15:30):**  own internal assessments of when it makes sense and how it makes sense, what kind of  
**[0:15:34-0:15:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:15:34):**  roles are appropriate for them depending upon the kind of business that they have.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:15:39):**  Now, one of the things I think that is constraining this is that most of our major institutions  
**[0:15:46-0:15:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:15:46):**  don't support this kind of integrated landscape management.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:15:52):**  Our policies and government rules and the ways that government agencies operate regulations  
**[0:15:59-0:16:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:15:59):**  and make public sector investments are still very, very much siloed, very, very siloed,  
**[0:16:06-0:16:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:16:06):**  very sectoral and at the same time so are the financial institutions.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:16:12):**  So if you have a business that has got together with some NGOs and the local government and  
**[0:16:19-0:16:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:16:19):**  have agreed to co-invest in let's say riparian restoration so as to improve water quality  
**[0:16:27-0:16:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:16:27):**  for all of the actors that are depending upon that water, they often can't get any financing  
**[0:16:32-0:16:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:16:32):**  for that because the finance is also itself quite siloed by sector and also quite differentiated  
**[0:16:40-0:16:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:16:40):**  in terms of whether the investor or the person getting the loan or the grant or the equity  
**[0:16:45-0:16:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:16:45):**  investment is in the public, private or civic sphere.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:16:49):**  So if you're really looking at how do we scale up good practices at the farm, forest, outside  
**[0:16:56-0:17:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:16:56):**  the agricultural areas but that have impact on agricultural areas so that you may have  
**[0:17:02-0:17:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:17:02):**  in order to scale up to restore watershed functions, we work in a number of landscapes  
**[0:17:08-0:17:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:17:08):**  where they've managed to actually get rivers that were no longer running all year round.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:17:13):**  They got enough land users around all of the rivers, all the farmers that were using irrigation  
**[0:17:18-0:17:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:17:18):**  et cetera to shift their practices so those rivers are now running all year round which  
**[0:17:23-0:17:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:17:23):**  of course is quite transformational not only for agricultural production but also for biodiversity  
**[0:17:27-0:17:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:17:27):**  and for many other services that are in that landscape.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:17:30):**  But you need to be able to have all of the actors do complementary and coordinated activities  
**[0:17:36-0:17:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:17:36):**  in order to achieve change that are really be transformative at scale and we have very  
**[0:17:41-0:17:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:17:41):**  few financial models for doing that.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:17:44):**  So people have to kind of jerry-rig the finance and put it together and there's a real need  
**[0:17:50-0:17:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:17:50):**  for and we call that sort of a financial aggregator or financial coordinators, brokers that say  
**[0:17:58-0:18:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:17:58):**  okay if we're going to actually restore this degraded area over there, the protected area  
**[0:18:05-0:18:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:18:05):**  is going to have to do these things there and the coffee farmers are going to have to  
**[0:18:09-0:18:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:18:09):**  do these things and then the maize farmers are going to have to do that and then the  
**[0:18:14-0:18:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:18:14):**  local government infrastructure is going to have to shift from using this to that practice.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:18:19):**  You need to have somebody who says okay what's the financing plan for this action plan?  
**[0:18:24-0:18:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:18:24):**  So you have many of these landscape initiatives actually most of them they spend a few years  
**[0:18:29-0:18:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:18:29):**  coming together to get a shared understanding of how the landscape is actually operating  
**[0:18:35-0:18:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:18:35):**  and where the risks are and where the opportunities are and where the trade-offs are and where  
**[0:18:39-0:18:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:18:39):**  the synergies are and they develop an action plan.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:18:42):**  But what we're finding is that very few of them actually then develop a financing strategy  
**[0:18:48-0:18:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:18:48):**  that would allow the investments that need to take place among the different land users,  
**[0:18:53-0:18:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:18:53):**  among the different farmers, the different agribusinesses or food industries and other  
**[0:18:57-0:19:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:18:57):**  actors that are affecting the land use to achieve the impacts at scale that they need.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:19:04):**  Yeah and then often what you see or what at least I see from a bit outside the space is  
**[0:19:08-0:19:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:19:08):**  that the people on the ground running interesting projects, the farms that are scaling up their  
**[0:19:15-0:19:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:19:15):**  agenda of agriculture practices etc. cannot find the financing and are complaining that  
**[0:19:20-0:19:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:19:20):**  there are no good investors and then the investors you talk to say they cannot find the projects  
**[0:19:24-0:19:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:19:24):**  and the companies to invest in because there are no good investments and probably the truth  
**[0:19:28-0:19:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:19:28):**  is somewhere in the middle and has to do with language etc.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:19:31):**  But you've been describing, I've read two ways of one is helping those people on the  
**[0:19:36-0:19:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:19:36):**  ground to get to that financial plan.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:19:39):**  How would it work as a sort of incubator or help to, after you've made the ecosystem plan  
**[0:19:46-0:19:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:19:46):**  and the landscape plan, to also make the financial plan to do that?  
**[0:19:49-0:19:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:19:49):**  How are you working in that part of the sector at the moment?  
**[0:19:55-0:19:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:19:55):**  Well I think that you identified the fact that the issue is actually on both sides and  
**[0:19:58-0:20:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:19:58):**  I actually think they're both true.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:20:00):**  We do find that many of the groups that are the best at designing regenerative agriculture  
**[0:20:07-0:20:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:20:07):**  investments even at scale don't have a very good sense of…  
**[0:20:12-0:20:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:20:12):**  Are very bad at designing financial systems.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:20:14):**  They don't understand what kinds of financial institutions would potentially be interested  
**[0:20:19-0:20:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:20:19):**  in that kind of investment given the time frame, the scale, the nature of the flow of  
**[0:20:24-0:20:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:20:24):**  returns and those things.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:20:26):**  So they go after the wrong financial groups.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:20:29):**  They think, oh I'll go to a bank for this but that's actually not the kind of investment  
**[0:20:33-0:20:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:20:33):**  that a bank would ever give you.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:20:35):**  You need to go to an impact investor for that or maybe you need to get some blended finance.  
**[0:20:39-0:20:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:20:39):**  You're finding some extremely interesting innovative partnerships around finance that  
**[0:20:43-0:20:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:20:43):**  are happening whereby civil society groups, private sector groups and sometimes governments  
**[0:20:50-0:20:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:20:50):**  will come in to co-finance particular activities.  
**[0:20:53-0:20:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:20:53):**  So there's a lot of innovation going on in this space.  
**[0:20:56-0:20:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:20:56):**  It's just that…  
**[0:20:57-0:21:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:20:57):**  So on the one hand while they're trying to sort out their own understanding of finance,  
**[0:21:03-0:21:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:21:03):**  on the other side the financial institutions are often quite so rigid in the kinds of their  
**[0:21:09-0:21:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:21:09):**  definition about the kinds of things that they finance that they're not exploring in  
**[0:21:13-0:21:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:21:13):**  a creative enough way new models of finance.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:21:17):**  And I think this is also one of the things that's changed so much in the last couple  
**[0:21:20-0:21:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:21:20):**  of years.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:21:21):**  We are seeing the most innovative experiments going on, I would say some of them are, about  
**[0:21:27-0:21:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:21:27):**  how they can connect different actors within a landscape and all of it taking place within  
**[0:21:33-0:21:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:21:33):**  the frame of an agreed long-term action plan so that it's complementary with what others  
**[0:21:38-0:21:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:21:38):**  are doing within the landscape.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:21:40):**  So I'm quite encouraged by the amount of innovation that's going on.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:21:45):**  But I think until the financial sector quite seriously looks at how they can address the  
**[0:21:52-0:22:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:21:52):**  need for these kinds of more sustainable multi-objective, multi-actor investment situations, we will  
**[0:22:02-0:22:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:22:02):**  be limited in terms of how far we can go.  
**[0:22:04-0:22:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:22:04):**  And I think you're starting to see that happen.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:22:06):**  You're starting to see now even some of the larger financial institutions be implementing  
**[0:22:12-0:22:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:22:12):**  certain lines of finance to explore how they can make a change in the way that they're  
**[0:22:19-0:22:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:22:19):**  doing.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:22:20):**  But at the same time I think there is a really important role for the development of incubators,  
**[0:22:26-0:22:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:22:26):**  the development of aggregators who can work with these landscape groups that have both  
**[0:22:32-0:22:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:22:32):**  the financial expertise but also have an understanding of what is the nature of the kinds of financial  
**[0:22:38-0:22:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:22:38):**  investments that are needed.  
**[0:22:40-0:22:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:22:40):**  One of the important things that we've learned from our work with doing landscape finance  
**[0:22:45-0:22:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:22:45):**  is that it's important to distinguish between the asset investments, which are the investments  
**[0:22:51-0:22:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:22:51):**  that are actually going to change what's going on with the production system or with the  
**[0:22:55-0:23:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:22:55):**  natural resource management that's going to change the infrastructure, whether it's built  
**[0:23:00-0:23:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:23:00):**  infrastructure or natural infrastructure, et cetera.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:23:04):**  You have your short-term and your long-term asset investments.  
**[0:23:07-0:23:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:23:07):**  You have your high return, your lower return ones.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:23:10):**  Each of those need to have a different segment of the financing sector to be available to  
**[0:23:15-0:23:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:23:15):**  them.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:23:16):**  But at the same time you've got other investments that we call the enabling investments, which  
**[0:23:21-0:23:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:23:21):**  are the ones that enable you to achieve scale.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:23:24):**  They're the ones that provide training in new regenerative agricultural practices to  
**[0:23:31-0:23:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:23:31):**  hundreds of thousands of farmers rather than just 5,000 farmers.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:23:35):**  They are these incubation roles to support, to bring some of these novel kinds of investments  
**[0:23:42-0:23:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:23:42):**  to become investable.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:23:44):**  They are the roles for documenting the performance both of the businesses and the performance  
**[0:23:51-0:23:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:23:51):**  of the landscape, because one of the things that financial institutions look for is track  
**[0:23:55-0:23:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:23:55):**  record.  
**[0:23:56-0:23:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:23:56):**  So we've got a real problem with these landscape, these novel landscape investments.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:23:59):**  They just have not developed a track record.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:24:01):**  And even where they have, that track record has not been well documented and shared with  
**[0:24:06-0:24:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:24:06):**  the institutions.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:24:07):**  So I think there's a whole lot of other roles, the landscape-  
**[0:24:10-0:24:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:24:10):**  Field building almost.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:24:11):**  Yes, exactly.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:24:13):**  You're really creating in some sense new institutions.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:24:16):**  I think that's what we need to think about for something really transformational.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:24:21):**  If we're going to see the agricultural sector move from being the greatest threat to our  
**[0:24:27-0:24:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:24:27):**  water resources to become one of the greatest tools for conserving water, if we want to  
**[0:24:32-0:24:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:24:32):**  see agriculture move from being the greatest threat to biodiversity to become one of the  
**[0:24:35-0:24:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:24:35):**  most important habitats to help support networks and habitat networks for species, if you want  
**[0:24:41-0:24:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:24:41):**  to see it move from becoming one of the most important contributors to greenhouse gases  
**[0:24:46-0:24:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:24:46):**  to being one of the most important sources of sequestration of greenhouse gases, we have  
**[0:24:50-0:24:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:24:50):**  to think about change at scale and it is going to imply changes in our financial institutions.  
**[0:24:56-0:24:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:24:56):**  And I think the businesses are starting to move in that direction.  
**[0:24:58-0:25:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:24:58):**  I think the financial system is not moving as quickly.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:25:02):**  And I think that's one of the top priorities for making this approach really deliver its  
**[0:25:08-0:25:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:25:08):**  promise.  
**[0:25:10-0:25:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:25:10):**  And if you look at a slightly more practical level at your work at the moment, what have  
**[0:25:15-0:25:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:25:15):**  you been busy with?  
**[0:25:17-0:25:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:25:17):**  Of course, if you can share that for the last few months and what kept you up at night basically  
**[0:25:22-0:25:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:25:22):**  and what will keep you up at night for the next few months?  
**[0:25:26-0:25:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:25:26):**  That's a great question.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:25:27):**  Actually, what's been keeping me up at night have been good things.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:25:30):**  Too much work, but good things.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:25:33):**  I just finished about two weeks ago a really incredibly inspiring experience in Addis Ababa,  
**[0:25:41-0:25:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:25:41):**  where we helped to organize a meeting of 140 individuals who are leading African landscape  
**[0:25:51-0:25:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:25:51):**  initiatives from 17 countries.  
**[0:25:55-0:25:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:25:55):**  And these were movers and shakers.  
**[0:25:56-0:26:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:25:56):**  These were people who were actually implementing these landscape partnerships, were totally  
**[0:26:01-0:26:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:26:01):**  in it.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:26:02):**  And it was an opportunity for them to share experiences and to identify what was going  
**[0:26:06-0:26:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:26:06):**  well and what wasn't going well.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:26:08):**  So I spent a lot of the last couple months helping to organize a really fruitful and  
**[0:26:14-0:26:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:26:14):**  creative kind of meeting.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:26:16):**  And two of the most important subjects that were discussed there were the role of businesses  
**[0:26:21-0:26:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:26:21):**  and how to strengthen and have really productive roles of businesses in these landscape initiatives.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:26:28):**  And another one of the topics was around finance and what kind of innovations in finance were  
**[0:26:32-0:26:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:26:32):**  there.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:26:33):**  So what came out of that meeting was a set of priorities in Africa for scaling up integrated  
**[0:26:41-0:26:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:26:41):**  landscape management with an agriculture focus throughout the continent.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:26:48):**  And we had a number of important institutions from the public sector, some from the private  
**[0:26:54-0:27:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:26:54):**  sector and civil society sector who made commitments to move forward on activities such as the  
**[0:27:00-0:27:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:27:00):**  development of an incubator for East Africa that would support landscape initiatives,  
**[0:27:07-0:27:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:27:07):**  developing a community of practice of individuals interested in developing new forms of landscape  
**[0:27:15-0:27:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:27:15):**  finance, of developing an outreach campaign with some of the financial institutions to  
**[0:27:23-0:27:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:27:23):**  educate them about the kinds of financial opportunities that there were, but informed  
**[0:27:28-0:27:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:27:28):**  by people who actually know how to tell what is a good financial opportunity and what isn't.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:27:33):**  So there was a whole series of outcomes from that meeting and we're already seeing follow  
**[0:27:39-0:27:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:27:39):**  up from those.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:27:41):**  We ourselves are supporting a network of landscape initiatives in Kenya and in Ethiopia and in  
**[0:27:49-0:27:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:27:49):**  Tanzania that have started to do very active sharing exchange and also collaboratively  
**[0:27:56-0:28:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:27:56):**  going to policymakers when they need to see a policy change that will make it easier for  
**[0:28:00-0:28:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:28:00):**  them to operate in these places.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:28:03):**  And you're also seeing this new mobilization of private sector actors, particularly from  
**[0:28:10-0:28:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:28:10):**  agribusiness and the food industry, also from the forestry sector and bioenergy sectors  
**[0:28:17-0:28:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:28:17):**  as well that are looking at these new opportunities for landscape investments.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:28:25):**  And for investments that will deliver landscape benefits.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:28:29):**  And I think one of the messages that I would say to investors is if you are planning to  
**[0:28:36-0:28:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:28:36):**  support agriculture or forestry or some of these other natural resource management activities,  
**[0:28:42-0:28:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:28:42):**  go to a place where there is already an organized landscape partnership that has done their  
**[0:28:47-0:28:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:28:47):**  homework about what's working and what's not working, where the threats are, what are the  
**[0:28:51-0:28:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:28:51):**  kinds of changes that are needed, where in the landscape and that would provide some  
**[0:28:55-0:28:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:28:55):**  guidance and sort of vision of where they're going because that is likely to very significantly  
**[0:28:59-0:29:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:28:59):**  reduce risks for you in doing your, because you know where your company, you know where  
**[0:29:05-0:29:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:29:05):**  your investment fits within a larger plan of landscape action.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:29:11):**  And also there are partners there who understand what you want to get and can come in to do  
**[0:29:16-0:29:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:29:16):**  things like co-invest with you on infrastructure that you might jointly need or could come  
**[0:29:21-0:29:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:29:21):**  in and provide say the training that your farmers you're working with need without necessarily  
**[0:29:27-0:29:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:29:27):**  as much cost to you.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:29:28):**  So I think there's some real opportunities that are just becoming realized there.  
**[0:29:31-0:29:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:29:31):**  So I'm quite excited about what's going to happen over this next year.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:29:35):**  And when you are, as hopefully everybody is a smart impact investor, looking at different  
**[0:29:41-0:29:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:29:41):**  landscapes or different landscape partnerships, how do you recognize a good one?  
**[0:29:45-0:29:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:29:45):**  How should a master plan, should one of those plans look?  
**[0:29:47-0:29:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:29:47):**  Which questions should you ask if you are doubting between two or three to become active?  
**[0:29:52-0:29:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:29:52):**  Of course you should do more as many as possible.  
**[0:29:55-0:29:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:29:55):**  Let's say you can only do one.  
**[0:29:57-0:30:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:29:57):**  What would be a few smart questions to ask from your perspective?  
**[0:30:00-0:30:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:30:00):**  No I think it's a really good question and it's so interesting that just in the last  
**[0:30:04-0:30:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:30:04):**  like two years that question is coming up for people as they get serious about doing  
**[0:30:09-0:30:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:30:09):**  this.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:30:10):**  We're actually involved in the development of a couple of tools to assess to what extent,  
**[0:30:15-0:30:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:30:15):**  how well landscape partnerships are actually operating internally.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:30:19):**  That's actually already been developed and is being widely tested.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:30:23):**  We're in the process right now of testing and training in the use of a new tool to assess  
**[0:30:30-0:30:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:30:30):**  the governance of landscapes, which is certainly one of the things that they're very interested.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:30:36):**  And also a third tool that we're doing collaboratively with a couple of other partners trying to  
**[0:30:42-0:30:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:30:42):**  answer specifically that question for investors.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:30:44):**  They think some of the key, they have quite a checklist of the kinds of things that they  
**[0:30:49-0:30:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:30:49):**  should be looking at.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:30:51):**  But one of them is whether there is a stab, sort of a commitment within the landscape  
**[0:30:56-0:31:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:30:56):**  among key partners around a future vision that some of the homework has already been  
**[0:31:03-0:31:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:31:03):**  done about where people consider to be the sensitive spots.  
**[0:31:08-0:31:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:31:08):**  What are the kinds of production systems that will fit with the plans for moving forward?  
**[0:31:17-0:31:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:31:17):**  Where are some of the new opportunities?  
**[0:31:18-0:31:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:31:18):**  I would certainly want to look at where there is, work in places where there's already significant  
**[0:31:26-0:31:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:31:26):**  thinking about market innovations, about finding ways to make money at the farm level or within  
**[0:31:32-0:31:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:31:32):**  ecotourism or payments for ecosystem services, et cetera.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:31:36):**  But where people are already thinking about a vision where production and agriculture  
**[0:31:41-0:31:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:31:41):**  and business are going to be good also for environmental concerns and social concerns.  
**[0:31:48-0:31:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:31:48):**  So you want to look at work in places where those conversations have been taking place  
**[0:31:51-0:31:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:31:51):**  for some time.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:31:52):**  You want to look for a place where the business, where the government, the local governments  
**[0:31:57-0:32:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:31:57):**  are at least supportive, if not playing a leadership role in some of these initiatives  
**[0:32:02-0:32:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:32:02):**  and that you know that the kind of policy framework in which you would be operating  
**[0:32:06-0:32:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:32:06):**  is going to be supportive for this kind of a business.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:32:09):**  So those are some of the kinds of things that we look at.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:32:11):**  Obviously there's questions that are the typical ones around land tenure, around access to  
**[0:32:16-0:32:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:32:16):**  skilled people, et cetera.  
**[0:32:18-0:32:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:32:18):**  But I think being in a place where there's commitment already to collaborative investment  
**[0:32:21-0:32:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:32:21):**  and collaborative action is a real plus for an investor.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:32:24):**  It's great.  
**[0:32:25-0:32:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:32:25):**  And also I'm very much looking forward to share, if of course when the tool is ready  
**[0:32:32-0:32:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:32:32):**  in public, the tool for screening for interesting landscapes for investors.  
**[0:32:37-0:32:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:32:37):**  Let's say hopefully some of the listeners to this podcast are working at a larger financial  
**[0:32:42-0:32:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:32:42):**  institution.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:32:43):**  You've mentioned in your publication in 2015 about the 11 trillion stranded assets.  
**[0:32:51-0:32:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:32:51):**  So what does that refer to?  
**[0:32:54-0:32:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:32:54):**  We all know the divest-invest movement of fossil fuels, I hope.  
**[0:32:57-0:33:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:32:57):**  And I've seen a bit of push to look at agriculture in the same way.  
**[0:33:02-0:33:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:33:02):**  But could you explain briefly, if I'm in a big financial institution, probably I have  
**[0:33:07-0:33:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:33:07):**  exposure to agriculture, why should I be worried?  
**[0:33:10-0:33:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:33:10):**  I think there's I guess two things that I want to say about that.  
**[0:33:13-0:33:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:33:13):**  The first is why you should be worried and secondly about some of the innovations that  
**[0:33:16-0:33:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:33:16):**  are actually coming around to address that.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:33:19):**  There is no question that we have, first of all, the level of degradation globally in  
**[0:33:24-0:33:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:33:24):**  agricultural lands is remarkably high.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:33:28):**  It's estimated to be 30 to 40 percent of agricultural lands have some form of degradation.  
**[0:33:34-0:33:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:33:34):**  Now some of those forms of degradation can be offset to some extent.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:33:37):**  For example, some of the loss of fertility can be offset to some extent with fertilizers.  
**[0:33:43-0:33:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:33:43):**  Some of the loss of infiltration of water can be offset by better water systems.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:33:50):**  But many of those are actually creating chronic losses in productivity and it's moving in  
**[0:33:57-0:33:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:33:57):**  a very big downward spiral.  
**[0:33:59-0:34:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:33:59):**  I worked, for example, in one area of Tanzania where they have identified rice production  
**[0:34:04-0:34:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:34:04):**  as one of the most exciting and profitable opportunities for investors of all types.  
**[0:34:10-0:34:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:34:10):**  A recent study there found 100 percent of all the farms surveyed already had substantial  
**[0:34:16-0:34:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:34:16):**  salinization in their rice fields, which does not bode well for the future.  
**[0:34:22-0:34:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:34:22):**  So I think there's been almost a putting your head in the sand by many agricultural investors  
**[0:34:28-0:34:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:34:28):**  and many people in the agricultural community who think you can solve all the problems with  
**[0:34:33-0:34:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:34:33):**  better seed, better fertilizer, better pest control and better markets.  
**[0:34:37-0:34:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:34:37):**  And all of those things are extremely important, but they will not address major climate changes.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:34:44):**  If all of a sudden wind velocities are much higher going through your orchard, you will  
**[0:34:49-0:34:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:34:49):**  get major losses.  
**[0:34:52-0:34:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:34:52):**  And so if you're not going to do something about landscape configurations of establishing  
**[0:34:55-0:34:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:34:55):**  windbreaks, you're going to have very substantial losses in agriculture.  
**[0:34:59-0:35:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:34:59):**  And I think in general there is simply a myopia.  
**[0:35:05-0:35:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:35:05):**  Most of the screening criteria for good agricultural investments today actually don't look at the  
**[0:35:12-0:35:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:35:12):**  sustainability of water supplies.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:35:14):**  They don't look at the long term productivity of the soils.  
**[0:35:18-0:35:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:35:18):**  They don't look at the impacts that climate change is going to have on production characteristics.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:35:22):**  And they're not looking at where the farm is in relationship to larger ecological and  
**[0:35:28-0:35:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:35:28):**  economic processes in the landscape.  
**[0:35:30-0:35:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:35:30):**  So I think that there are many assets out there that should be valued much lower than  
**[0:35:35-0:35:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:35:35):**  what they are right now because these factors have not been looked at.  
**[0:35:38-0:35:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:35:38):**  So I totally think this is going to be an issue.  
**[0:35:41-0:35:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:35:41):**  And it's going to be exacerbated by the fact that you're starting to have in some crops  
**[0:35:45-0:35:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:35:45):**  and in some parts of the world increasing demand from the industries that use the products  
**[0:35:51-0:35:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:35:51):**  that they don't want deforestation to be associated with their products.  
**[0:35:55-0:35:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:35:55):**  They don't want water loss to be associated with their products.  
**[0:35:59-0:36:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:35:59):**  So they're going to start looking at this from that perspective.  
**[0:36:03-0:36:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:36:03):**  And many things that look like they'd be really good assets will no longer be.  
**[0:36:07-0:36:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:36:07):**  So I absolutely think this is something for financial institutions to be careful about.  
**[0:36:13-0:36:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:36:13):**  Now on the positive side, there's just started to be some efforts at developing investment  
**[0:36:19-0:36:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:36:19):**  screens on some of these issues.  
**[0:36:21-0:36:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:36:21):**  If you go to the International Finance Corporation, for example, they've got some standards that  
**[0:36:26-0:36:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:36:26):**  require you to look at some aspects of a landscape such as water and sustainability of water  
**[0:36:32-0:36:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:36:32):**  supplies for those areas.  
**[0:36:35-0:36:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:36:35):**  There's also the Millennium Challenge Corporation, for example, developed something called a  
**[0:36:38-0:36:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:36:38):**  landscape life-scape analysis.  
**[0:36:40-0:36:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:36:40):**  And we're using it as a screen for investments in Indonesia that individual companies needed  
**[0:36:46-0:36:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:36:46):**  to show how their operation was connected with other things in the landscape that could  
**[0:36:52-0:36:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:36:52):**  potentially increase their risks or reduce their risks.  
**[0:36:55-0:36:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:36:55):**  And I think that was a fairly novel tool.  
**[0:36:58-0:37:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:36:58):**  But overall, I would say that this is not being carefully looked at.  
**[0:37:03-0:37:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:37:03):**  I was just speaking last June at a meeting with a bunch of agribusiness and food industry  
**[0:37:09-0:37:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:37:09):**  people from around the world looking specifically at this question of how to do effective landscape  
**[0:37:14-0:37:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:37:14):**  partnerships.  
**[0:37:15-0:37:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:37:15):**  And there was an example given from South Africa where one of the great achievements  
**[0:37:20-0:37:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:37:20):**  that was being tutored by the government and by the Chamber of Commerce was the development  
**[0:37:26-0:37:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:37:26):**  of an investment area where they had attracted something like 15 agribusiness and food industries  
**[0:37:33-0:37:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:37:33):**  to all come to that valley and operate and set up new manufacturing plants, et cetera.  
**[0:37:38-0:37:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:37:38):**  This was a big success.  
**[0:37:39-0:37:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:37:39):**  Well, it turns out that when you put all 15 of those companies there, their demand for  
**[0:37:44-0:37:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:37:44):**  water far outreached the availability of water in that area.  
**[0:37:50-0:37:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:37:50):**  And you started almost within a few years have some of those companies have to go out  
**[0:37:54-0:37:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:37:54):**  of business.  
**[0:37:55-0:38:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:37:55):**  They're not looking at the ecosystem sustainability of these systems at scale.  
**[0:38:00-0:38:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:38:00):**  They're looking in the short term at their own plot of land, but they're not looking  
**[0:38:04-0:38:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:38:04):**  at how that plot of land is linked with the larger landscape.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:38:07):**  Yeah.  
**[0:38:08-0:38:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:38:08):**  And I think that really summons it up.  
**[0:38:11-0:38:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:38:11):**  Look beyond your gate, beyond your fence, beyond your plot of land, whatever the size.  
**[0:38:16-0:38:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:38:16):**  If it's half an acre in Kenya or a few hundred thousand in Australia, you're still part of  
**[0:38:22-0:38:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:38:22):**  a larger ecosystem.  
**[0:38:24-0:38:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:38:24):**  And you can't escape that.  
**[0:38:26-0:38:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:38:26):**  You are.  
**[0:38:27-0:38:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:38:27):**  And on the positive side, there are great opportunities that open when you look across  
**[0:38:31-0:38:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:38:31):**  that fence line.  
**[0:38:33-0:38:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:38:33):**  There are people to co-invest with you.  
**[0:38:34-0:38:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:38:34):**  There's people who can reduce their risks that you face.  
**[0:38:38-0:38:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:38:38):**  There's people who can develop coalitions with you to look for more favorable kinds  
**[0:38:44-0:38:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:38:44):**  of and supportive policy measures.  
**[0:38:46-0:38:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:38:46):**  So I think it's both the negative and to keep in mind the positives of doing that.  
**[0:38:50-0:38:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:38:50):**  Yeah, and I think any long term investor has to have in any investment a holistic view,  
**[0:38:58-0:39:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:38:58):**  especially in agriculture, but of course also in energy, education, et cetera.  
**[0:39:02-0:39:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:39:02):**  How does that fit in a larger system?  
**[0:39:04-0:39:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:39:04):**  Doesn't make it easier to screen, but doesn't make it a lot less prone to risk and probably  
**[0:39:09-0:39:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:39:09):**  have a lot more opportunities, especially in the long term.  
**[0:39:12-0:39:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:39:12):**  Yeah, I've had a number of people who've spoken to me about that we are kind of in agriculture  
**[0:39:18-0:39:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:39:18):**  where we were maybe with sustainable agriculture 30 years ago.  
**[0:39:22-0:39:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:39:22):**  You mean a sustainable energy?  
**[0:39:23-0:39:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:39:23):**  Yeah.  
**[0:39:24-0:39:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:39:24):**  You know, the finance people didn't know much about it.  
**[0:39:25-0:39:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:39:25):**  You know, a lot of businesses didn't know much about it.  
**[0:39:27-0:39:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:39:27):**  We didn't have very many good models for it.  
**[0:39:29-0:39:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:39:29):**  And that this is really just a learning process.  
**[0:39:32-0:39:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:39:32):**  These are new markets.  
**[0:39:33-0:39:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:39:33):**  These are new and new approaches.  
**[0:39:35-0:39:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:39:35):**  And yeah, the other words that that sort of that process happened 30 years ago with sustainable  
**[0:39:40-0:39:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:39:40):**  energy.  
**[0:39:41-0:39:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:39:41):**  And now, of course, we have massive amounts of finance and many businesses, et cetera.  
**[0:39:44-0:39:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:39:44):**  And people know what that looks like.  
**[0:39:46-0:39:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:39:46):**  They know what the types are.  
**[0:39:47-0:39:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:39:47):**  They know what the risks are associated with it.  
**[0:39:50-0:39:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:39:50):**  It's a sector and it has a track record and their numbers.  
**[0:39:53-0:39:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:39:53):**  Yeah, it's a mature sector.  
**[0:39:55-0:40:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:39:55):**  And so I think we need to look at the sustainable agriculture and sustainable agricultural landscape  
**[0:40:00-0:40:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:40:00):**  world as just we are still in the sort of early years of that.  
**[0:40:05-0:40:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:40:05):**  And I think if we can be quite proactive, we can learn a lot from other sectors.  
**[0:40:09-0:40:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:40:09):**  And we can learn from the urban sectors.  
**[0:40:11-0:40:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:40:11):**  They've also done integrated investment programs that we probably could learn quite a lot about  
**[0:40:15-0:40:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:40:15):**  how they finance that and apply that to agriculture.  
**[0:40:18-0:40:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:40:18):**  But I think it does require that effort of innovative groups among the people who know  
**[0:40:24-0:40:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:40:24):**  the land, among the people who farm, who know the markets, who know the finance, who know  
**[0:40:28-0:40:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:40:28):**  the business and they know the governments to pull together to actually move this from  
**[0:40:34-0:40:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:40:34):**  a kind of an infant industry to a much more mature industry, which I think we could absolutely  
**[0:40:39-0:40:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:40:39):**  get to in the next 30 years.  
**[0:40:40-0:40:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:40:40):**  Yeah, and hopefully with those lessons actually speed it up and save us from some of the mistakes  
**[0:40:46-0:40:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:40:46):**  they have made and get to a more mature, which I think are really we've reached maybe five  
**[0:40:51-0:40:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:40:51):**  years ago in renewable energy in different markets and we're still reaching them in other  
**[0:40:56-0:40:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:40:56):**  parts of renewable energy.  
**[0:40:58-0:41:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:40:58):**  But hopefully reach that point a lot faster and we need to and hopefully we'll get there.  
**[0:41:02-0:41:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:41:02):**  Yeah.  
**[0:41:03-0:41:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:41:03):**  And I think the because particularly we do have these increasing risks for agriculture  
**[0:41:09-0:41:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:41:09):**  from climate, from water, from other places, I think there will be actually pretty if we  
**[0:41:13-0:41:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:41:13):**  can get together, there'll be a strong incentive to really sort of rethink our systems and  
**[0:41:18-0:41:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:41:18):**  then create institutional support to move towards those more sustainable regenerative  
**[0:41:23-0:41:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:41:23):**  agriculture systems.  
**[0:41:24-0:41:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:41:24):**  Yeah.  
**[0:41:25-0:41:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:41:25):**  And with that, I want to thank you so much for taking the time and sharing your knowledge,  
**[0:41:30-0:41:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:41:30):**  wisdom and experience in the sector.

**[0:43:29-0:43:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:43:29):**  After 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question how to put money  
**[0:43:33-0:43:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:43:33):**  to work in regenerating soils and have been following this space since 2011 and recording

**[0:44:20-0:44:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:44:20):**  People that are building soil at scale.  
**[0:44:23-0:44:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:44:23):**  And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office  
**[0:44:26-0:44:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:44:26):**  or as private individuals or people who are putting other people's money to work through

**[0:44:36-0:44:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:44:36):**  No.  
**[0:44:37-0:44:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:44:37):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:44:40-0:44:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:44:40):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.  
**[0:44:44-0:44:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:44:44):**  And I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very  
**[0:44:49-0:44:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:44:49):**  different means.  
**[0:44:50-0:44:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:44:50):**  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you, and if you have the means to  
**[0:44:55-0:44:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:44:55):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[0:44:57-0:44:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:44:57):**  Thank you.  
**[0:44:58-0:45:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:44:58):**  So what is this course?  
**[0:45:00-0:45:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:45:00):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  
**[0:45:06-0:45:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:45:06):**  so you don't have to write along.  
**[0:45:08-0:45:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:45:08):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:45:13-0:45:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:45:13):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:45:18-0:45:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:45:18):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find, or what kind of investors you could  
**[0:45:23-0:45:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:45:23):**  find if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:45:25-0:45:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:45:25):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:45:30-0:45:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:45:30):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:45:33-0:45:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:45:33):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design, and a lot more.  
**[0:45:38-0:45:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:45:38):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:45:39-0:45:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:45:39):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:45:41-0:45:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:45:41):**  Unfortunately, that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:45:44-0:45:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:45:44):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:45:47-0:45:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:45:47):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:45:49-0:45:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:45:49):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.  
**[0:45:55-0:45:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/#t=0:45:55):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea, or whatever you're drinking.

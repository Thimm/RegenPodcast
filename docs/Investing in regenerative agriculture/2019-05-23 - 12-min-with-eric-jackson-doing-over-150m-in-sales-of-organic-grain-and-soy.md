### Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food  (Thu, 23 May 2019 02:00:00)
## 12 min with Eric Jackson, doing over 150M in sales of organic grain and soy  
**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:00:00):**  You're listening to the summary of the interview. For a link to the full length episode, please check the description below.  
**[0:00:06-0:00:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:00:06):**  We're going to listen to an interview with Eric Jackson of Pipeline Foods,  
**[0:00:09-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:00:09):**  where we are discussing large scale conversion of land to organic farming.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:00:14):**  What holds farmers back while the demand is growing so rapidly?  
**[0:00:19-0:00:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:00:19):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture, Investing as if the Planet Mattered.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:00:25):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space.  
**[0:00:29-0:00:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:00:29):**  To learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities and ecosystems,  
**[0:00:36-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:00:36):**  while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:39-0:00:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:00:39):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:41-0:00:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:00:41):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat our land,  
**[0:00:46-0:00:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:00:46):**  grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:00:48-0:00:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:00:48):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers,  
**[0:00:52-0:00:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:00:52):**  start paying much more attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:00:56-0:01:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:00:56):**  Before we get started, I've been recording these interviews next to my day job and I will definitely continue to do so  
**[0:01:02-0:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:01:02):**  and release about an episode a month.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:01:03):**  But at the same time, I would love to take this further, share more interviews,  
**[0:01:07-0:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:01:07):**  there are many more stories to share on investing in regenerative food and agriculture.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:01:11):**  More depth, improve the quality, maybe even doing some video series.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:01:16):**  So I started a Patreon community, which makes it easy to support creators like myself.  
**[0:01:21-0:01:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:01:21):**  If these podcasts have been of value to you and if you have the means,  
**[0:01:25-0:01:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:01:25):**  I invite you to support me and make this happen.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:01:28):**  For more information, please find a link to my Patreon account in the description below.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:01:33):**  And now, without further ado, the interview. Enjoy!  
**[0:01:37-0:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:01:37):**  Well, like many of folks my age, who've been in agriculture for a career,  
**[0:01:45-0:01:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:01:45):**  when we started in the business, in my case 35 years ago, we were never given any information  
**[0:01:51-0:01:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:01:51):**  and it really wasn't the topic of conversation about how agriculture and sustainability could work together.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:01:59):**  But agriculture, particularly production agriculture, as a carbon sink was something that was relatively new  
**[0:02:07-0:02:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:02:07):**  even across the sustainability community.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:02:11):**  The idea of using minimum tillage in concert with nature as opposed to fighting.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:02:17):**  Fighting nature every step of the way during the growing season was producing every bit as much yield  
**[0:02:24-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:02:24):**  for these guys as conventional and their cost structure was much lower  
**[0:02:30-0:02:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:02:30):**  because they weren't having to buy all these inputs.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:02:36):**  Multigenerational farms that would do something for a long period of time, the same year after year,  
**[0:02:44-0:02:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:02:44):**  and then they recognized that some of the things that their grandfather used to do was actually better.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:02:51):**  Started bumping in more and more to folks that were at least diversified into organic row crop production.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:03:01):**  I was looking at the marketplace and watching the growth in the industry,  
**[0:03:07-0:03:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:03:07):**  double-digit growth year over year for many, many years.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:03:11):**  And again with my commercial hat on I was wondering what was being done in terms of the infrastructure  
**[0:03:19-0:03:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:03:19):**  or the supply.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:03:21):**  So the midstream between the farmer and the consumer, there's a lot of steps that happen.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:03:27):**  I was fascinated to try to figure out and see if that infrastructure had been keeping up with the whole marketplace.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:03:35):**  That both sides of the pipe can benefit if the pipe is built in such a way that it honors the desires on the demand side  
**[0:03:43-0:03:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:03:43):**  and honors the desires on the supply side.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:03:47):**  So today after not quite 18 months in business, we have headquarters here in Minneapolis,  
**[0:03:55-0:03:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:03:55):**  we have a team in Canada that manages our Canadian program,  
**[0:03:59-0:04:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:03:59):**  we have a team in Buenos Aires that manages our South American program,  
**[0:04:03-0:04:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:04:03):**  and we've created a partnership with a like-minded group out of Europe that gives us a global program  
**[0:04:11-0:04:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:04:11):**  in terms of being able to work directly with growers today in about 20 countries.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:04:17):**  So we said let's be completely transparent and create sort of a two-way telescope  
**[0:04:23-0:04:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:04:23):**  consistent with the thesis of a pipe, I guess, and give both visibility to each other  
**[0:04:29-0:04:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:04:29):**  and strengthen the food system in a way that hasn't really been done at least at a commercial scale before.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:04:37):**  So again today, like you said, we have somewhere in the neighborhood of just over 50 people.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:04:45):**  We have four grain elevators, two in Saskatchewan and two in North Dakota.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:04:53):**  We have a small oilseed crushing operation in Missouri.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:04:59):**  I'm quoting here, perhaps one of the hardest parts of this journey is to walk into a local coffee shop  
**[0:05:04-0:05:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:05:04):**  and getting the cold shoulder for doing something different.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:05:07):**  How do you work on that psychology piece that I'm going to be the weird one in the village  
**[0:05:13-0:05:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:05:13):**  and the community because I'm going organic and I'm going to have a very messy field?  
**[0:05:18-0:05:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:05:18):**  One of the things that we're starting to do is to create a community  
**[0:05:22-0:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:05:22):**  and connecting all various farmers to each other, giving them the opportunity  
**[0:05:28-0:05:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:05:28):**  to understand that although they may be odd in the local coffee shop,  
**[0:05:31-0:05:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:05:31):**  that in the global coffee shop they're not that odd.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:05:38):**  And in terms of what means regenerative agriculture for pipeline foods and what are your plans in that?  
**[0:05:45-0:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:05:45):**  To make change is when you can connect the demand side to the supply side because the primary exchange is money.  
**[0:05:54-0:06:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:05:54):**  And without money, the universe of participants shrinks to only those who are mission driven,  
**[0:06:02-0:06:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:06:02):**  which is important, but in my mind not sufficient.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:06:07):**  So we're trying to figure out how the signals are going to get sent, if you will,  
**[0:06:13-0:06:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:06:13):**  and regenerative is a relatively new signal in the commercial world.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:06:18):**  Our approach at this point is a little bit of a wait and see,  
**[0:06:22-0:06:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:06:22):**  not because individually as people we aren't sympathetic to many of the ideals expressed in regenerative conversation.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:06:36):**  I tell my team at some level we shouldn't care about motivation  
**[0:06:40-0:06:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:06:40):**  as long as the outcomes are aligned with our business philosophy, our ethos.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:06:46):**  So if a person, if a grower, for example, is solely motivated by money  
**[0:06:51-0:06:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:06:51):**  and that's the way that we can get that grower to behave in a different way,  
**[0:06:56-0:07:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:06:56):**  that creates an economic opportunity for the grower and an abundance of additional environmental outcomes.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:07:03):**  We shouldn't care.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:07:04):**  We shouldn't be so altruistic that we need for people to stand up and salute some sort of flag or some sort of icon.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:07:15):**  We should really care about the outcomes of the endeavor.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:07:19):**  And so with soil health being really the topic that's driving that conversation,  
**[0:07:26-0:07:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:07:26):**  now getting commercialized by major food companies and major participants in the value chain,  
**[0:07:33-0:07:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:07:33):**  out of that conversation now.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:07:39):**  In the U.S. one of the things that has become more apparent now to the rural communities is that they're groundwater.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:07:47):**  So in addition, take away the surface water discussion and go to groundwater.  
**[0:07:53-0:08:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:07:53):**  Many of the rural community wells that would be supplying a small town are impaired in terms of water quality.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:08:02):**  And there's no secret about what the source of that impairment is.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:08:06):**  It's clearly agricultural leaching.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:08:12):**  Now if I could snap my fingers and turn the entire world organic overnight,  
**[0:08:18-0:08:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:08:18):**  I do not believe at this point, I wouldn't have said this a few years ago,  
**[0:08:23-0:08:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:08:23):**  but I do not believe at this point that you would see any decrease in production.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:08:27):**  And in fact, I would argue that over the long term, this is the only way that things can work over the long term.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:08:34):**  But you'd see an immediate impact in terms of environmental outcomes.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:08:38):**  And I think people would be astounded and understand that they've been fed a bunch of stories that aren't necessarily true  
**[0:08:45-0:08:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:08:45):**  about the need for using synthetic production methods, you know, to be able to feed the world.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:08:52):**  This whole feed the world concept is a red herring.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:08:57):**  Another interesting point of tension is because you've got what I'll call the legacy organic crowd,  
**[0:09:05-0:09:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:09:05):**  who are typically farming smaller acreage and very intensive, you know, maybe 40 different crops on an acre.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:09:17):**  But it's mostly designed for local use.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:09:21):**  And fruit and vegetables.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:09:23):**  And fruits and vegetables. And that's great.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:09:25):**  And not grain.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:09:26):**  But it's great. I mean, that's the food I want to eat.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:09:29):**  And I'm glad that those programs are up and going.  
**[0:09:33-0:09:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:09:33):**  But that is not going to make a systemic change on a local, regional or certainly global level.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:09:41):**  You have to get the broad acre.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:09:46):**  What kind of size you are dealing with?  
**[0:09:48-0:09:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:09:48):**  Yeah, so I mean, some of these figures are estimates.  
**[0:09:53-0:10:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:09:53):**  But in our most recent review of the acreage that we are currently working with,  
**[0:10:03-0:10:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:10:03):**  North America, I believe it's 1.4, give or take 1.4 million acres.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:10:11):**  You know, investment in soil health, I mean, you can create a whole wheel of fortune, if you will,  
**[0:10:19-0:10:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:10:19):**  with lots of slivers of benefits, all coming from essentially the same thing.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:10:27):**  And so if you can pool capital and that capital can be put to work to help sponsor the initiation.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:10:36):**  Because our biggest problem in the US is we do not have enough acres that are organic to support our domestic demands.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:10:45):**  So we're importing. Now, granted, we're always going to import things we can't grow here.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:10:49):**  But we import 75% of our organic corn and soybeans.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:10:53):**  But the point is we are the king of soybeans and corn.  
**[0:10:56-0:11:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/#t=0:10:56):**  And yet we're importing organic soybeans and organic corn because we don't grow enough here.

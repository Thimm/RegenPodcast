**[0:00:30-0:00:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:00:30):**  enterprise.

**[0:00:49-0:00:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:00:49):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture.  
**[0:00:53-0:00:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:00:53):**  Investing as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:55-0:01:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:00:55):**  Today I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space to learn more on  
**[0:01:00-0:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:01:00):**  how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities and ecosystems  
**[0:01:06-0:01:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:01:06):**  while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:09-0:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:01:09):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:11-0:01:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:01:11):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:15-0:01:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:01:15):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:01:18):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much  
**[0:01:22-0:01:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:01:22):**  more attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:27-0:01:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:01:27):**  In March last year we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support  
**[0:01:31-0:01:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:01:31):**  our work and so many of you have joined as a member.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:01:34):**  We've launched different types of benefits, exclusive content, Q&A webinars with former  
**[0:01:38-0:01:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:01:38):**  guests, ask me anything sessions plus so much more to come in the future.

**[0:01:51-0:01:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:01:51):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:01:53):**  Welcome to another episode today with Kirstie Settler, the Chief Marketing Officer of New  
**[0:01:58-0:01:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:01:58):**  Foundation Farms.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:01:59):**  This is part of our series where we unpeel the onion of New Foundation Farms who are  
**[0:02:02-0:02:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:02:02):**  raising 20 million pounds to buy a thousand acres in the UK, building a regenerative agri  
**[0:02:08-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:02:08):**  food enterprise.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:02:09):**  And today we're going to go deep into the agri food enterprise.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:02:12):**  Welcome Kirstie.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:02:13):**  Hello, thanks for having me.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:02:15):**  And to start with the personal question we always love to ask, how did you end up in  
**[0:02:19-0:02:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:02:19):**  this case in New Foundation Farms working on soils and so much more in the UK?  
**[0:02:24-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:02:24):**  Yes.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:02:25):**  So for me, actually, when I think about the whole team, I'm probably the newest to regenerative  
**[0:02:30-0:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:02:30):**  agriculture.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:02:31):**  And I think I've probably had a sort of slightly squiggly career.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:02:35):**  But I think actually, fundamentally, it's like a tale of two parents.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:02:39):**  So I had one parent who really railed against education, ultimately is quite capitalist  
**[0:02:45-0:02:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:02:45):**  still to this day admires Thatcher.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:02:48):**  And then I have another parent who lived really with feet on the ground, head in the clouds,  
**[0:02:53-0:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:02:53):**  believed in endless curiosity, and the power of imagination.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:02:58):**  And that for me is what led me to start my career in advertising, because I've always  
**[0:03:03-0:03:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:03:03):**  found I've existed in that sort of space of tension really, between the commercial world  
**[0:03:09-0:03:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:03:09):**  and a sense of creativity.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:03:12):**  And actually, though, what has now increasingly been more around purpose and impact.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:03:17):**  And so for me, that's why I find regenerative agriculture, although it's really only something  
**[0:03:22-0:03:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:03:22):**  I discovered less than a year ago.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:03:24):**  But that's what I find so compelling about it.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:03:26):**  I think the economic case for regenerative agriculture is ironclad when you look at the  
**[0:03:32-0:03:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:03:32):**  way in which it can operate and manifest.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:03:34):**  But then I find on the other side of things as well, the timing now to be able to reengage  
**[0:03:40-0:03:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:03:40):**  people with farming, the importance of soil, just what it is as a matter and how it exists  
**[0:03:47-0:03:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:03:47):**  and how little we know about it, I think is amazing.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:03:50):**  And it's literally got a sense of stability to it, I think, and potentially certainty.  
**[0:03:55-0:03:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:03:55):**  Grounded.  
**[0:03:56-0:03:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:03:56):**  Yeah, literally.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:03:57):**  So I think this idea, the timing now to be able to get people to be more interested and  
**[0:04:04-0:04:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:04:04):**  inspired by soil, and then the role it can play in agriculture, and of course, ultimately  
**[0:04:09-0:04:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:04:09):**  food, I find that actually very hopeful.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:04:13):**  So it's again, it's about sitting between sort of the tension of what I tend to see  
**[0:04:17-0:04:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:04:17):**  as those two sides.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:04:19):**  That's really what drew me to regenerative agriculture, which is how I came to find me  
**[0:04:25-0:04:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:04:25):**  meet Mark and Marcus, the two first co-founders of New Foundation Farms.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:04:30):**  And you've worked in food before, you didn't work only in, let's say, advertisement and  
**[0:04:35-0:04:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:04:35):**  the world of broadly storytelling.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:04:37):**  Can you explain a bit there because you weren't completely new to the food world or definitely  
**[0:04:41-0:04:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:04:41):**  not actually completely new to the food world?  
**[0:04:43-0:04:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:04:43):**  No, that's very true.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:04:44):**  Very true.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:04:45):**  So yes, I have many years in ad agencies, but then I happened to have a meeting in 2015.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:04:51):**  So almost six years ago now with the co-founder and CEO of Leon restaurants, which is a UK  
**[0:04:58-0:05:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:04:58):**  based business, but actually does have some restaurants in Europe.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:05:02):**  And it is a naturally fast food brand.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:05:05):**  So it's very much a business of food retail, but I joined as brand and marketing director  
**[0:05:11-0:05:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:05:11):**  at a point where the business was looking to go through rapid expansion.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:05:16):**  And that for me, or a whole host of learnings and experiences very much connected to food,  
**[0:05:23-0:05:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:05:23):**  where it comes from, what it can mean for people, how you can prepare it, the role of  
**[0:05:27-0:05:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:05:27):**  menus and recipes.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:05:29):**  And then of course the bit that sort of fits most closely with my title, but the marketing,  
**[0:05:34-0:05:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:05:34):**  how do you present it to people, how do you get it to become the food that they would  
**[0:05:38-0:05:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:05:38):**  choose to buy?  
**[0:05:39-0:05:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:05:39):**  So I spent four years as brand and marketing director in that business.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:05:42):**  And then actually after a hiatus, I returned last year to focus on sustainability and values,  
**[0:05:49-0:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:05:49):**  because I think that sustainability is something I've always personally been very driven by.  
**[0:05:54-0:06:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:05:54):**  And I did a MSC in sustainability and responsibility, gosh, 10 years ago now.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:06:00):**  But that for me as well, and knowing the Leon business the way I did, there was huge opportunity  
**[0:06:05-0:06:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:06:05):**  I think to be able to go back and focus on that side of things as well, which is of course  
**[0:06:10-0:06:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:06:10):**  kind of was a stepping stone to getting to understand the role of soil and regenerative  
**[0:06:14-0:06:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:06:14):**  agriculture.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:06:16):**  And then how did you end up here where you are now?  
**[0:06:19-0:06:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:06:19):**  I know the story, that's why I'm asking.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:06:21):**  And it's a testament of reaching out and doing, and it's not that you, it's an interesting  
**[0:06:27-0:06:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:06:27):**  story.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:06:28):**  Let's go into it.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:06:29):**  How did you meet Mark and Marcus?  
**[0:06:30-0:06:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:06:30):**  So I was in Leon and I was exploring how do we work with suppliers?  
**[0:06:36-0:06:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:06:36):**  So rather than that sense of, oh, we need better suppliers, let's change our supplies.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:06:40):**  I wanted to understand what are feasible ways of working with suppliers for them to have  
**[0:06:44-0:06:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:06:44):**  a more positive impact.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:06:46):**  So I was of course beginning to understand more around the role and the potential of  
**[0:06:50-0:06:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:06:50):**  soil and farming in a way that looked at soil health.  
**[0:06:53-0:06:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:06:53):**  And I think as lots of people did last year, actually, I was spending more time on LinkedIn  
**[0:06:58-0:07:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:06:58):**  and I came across somehow, I think through a set of connections in my network, I came  
**[0:07:02-0:07:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:07:02):**  across an article written by our chair in Responsible Investor magazine.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:07:08):**  So an article written by Mark on the role of regenerative agriculture and on its potential  
**[0:07:14-0:07:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:07:14):**  to offer a new asset class for investment in the UK.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:07:18):**  And I just found it so inspiring that there was something that had this much economic  
**[0:07:24-0:07:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:07:24):**  potential in it and obviously it was new to me so I didn't fully understand it.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:07:28):**  So I contacted him, I sent him a message on LinkedIn.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:07:31):**  I was like, right, read your article, thought it was fascinating, don't think I understand  
**[0:07:35-0:07:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:07:35):**  all of it, have you got time to talk?  
**[0:07:38-0:07:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:07:38):**  So we set up a call and it ended up, it was myself, Mark and Marcus and really within  
**[0:07:43-0:07:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:07:43):**  about 15 minutes, I just, I think felt a connection and we really hadn't obviously got very deep  
**[0:07:49-0:07:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:07:49):**  into any particular topic.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:07:51):**  But Mark, I think just said, would you be interested in working with us?  
**[0:07:56-0:07:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:07:56):**  Would you be interested in spending more time with us on the startup?  
**[0:07:58-0:08:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:07:58):**  We're creating a new foundation farm.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:08:01):**  And I just said, you know, I think I would.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:08:03):**  And I am a great believer in both synchronicity but the importance of timing and how paths  
**[0:08:09-0:08:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:08:09):**  can cross and that there can be meaning in that, even if it's not something that was  
**[0:08:13-0:08:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:08:13):**  entirely by design or was consciously created.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:08:17):**  And so yes, that led to a series of conversations over the months.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:08:22):**  And then for me more formally joining the team at the end of January this year.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:08:26):**  And no, I think it's a testament to reaching out, being open to things that don't start  
**[0:08:32-0:08:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:08:32):**  spamming obviously.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:08:33):**  I mean, don't, but for many people that are listening that want to get into or become  
**[0:08:37-0:08:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:08:37):**  active in this space and be active and try to, doesn't mean that you get always a response.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:08:41):**  People are extremely busy.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:08:42):**  I'm sorry if I didn't answer to some people.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:08:45):**  But it is interesting how these things happen, partly online, partly synchronicity, partly  
**[0:08:51-0:08:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:08:51):**  timing, but you have to be out there asking the questions, reaching out, be vulnerable  
**[0:08:55-0:08:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:08:55):**  and who knows what happens.  
**[0:08:57-0:08:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:08:57):**  Yeah.  
**[0:08:58-0:08:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:08:58):**  I'm a massive believer in that.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:08:59):**  That's how most of the opportunities for me professionally have happened.  
**[0:09:03-0:09:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:09:03):**  That really was the way in which actually I first joined Leon, for example, and sort  
**[0:09:07-0:09:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:09:07):**  of decisions before.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:09:08):**  But I definitely agree with the point you make, but I also think as well, it's having  
**[0:09:13-0:09:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:09:13):**  the right reasons for pursuing the lines of inquiry that you are as well.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:09:17):**  Because I think there is something where, like you say, having a good reason and a good  
**[0:09:21-0:09:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:09:21):**  intention behind those inquiries.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:09:23):**  I think that can become very clear quite quickly to people.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:09:26):**  Yeah.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:09:27):**  You really reach out because you wanted to understand more, not because you were looking  
**[0:09:29-0:09:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:09:29):**  for a job.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:09:31):**  There's a difference that people sense that and you had some general questions about how  
**[0:09:35-0:09:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:09:35):**  this would work, et cetera, as an interest.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:09:38):**  And so now that's interesting.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:09:39):**  And then, so you started in January, obviously already engaged before.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:09:43):**  And then the big question here, we unpeeled part of the onion.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:09:47):**  I keep going back to the onion.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:09:48):**  I don't know why.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:09:49):**  With Mark and Marcus.  
**[0:09:51-0:09:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:09:51):**  And now I think it's time to go deeper into what is a disruptive agri-food brand and what  
**[0:09:57-0:09:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:09:57):**  makes it unique.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:09:58):**  Why now is the time?  
**[0:10:00-0:10:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:10:00):**  And I'm very interested to dive deeper into what that is and what that is from a storytelling  
**[0:10:04-0:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:10:04):**  perspective and from a marketing and all of that.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:10:07):**  But let's start with what is to you a disruptive agri-food brand and why are we talking about  
**[0:10:12-0:10:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:10:12):**  it now?  
**[0:10:13-0:10:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:10:13):**  Yeah.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:10:14):**  So I think you can only really be disruptive if you've got quite a clear sense, obviously  
**[0:10:18-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:10:18):**  of context and sort of where you'll start from and therefore kind of how you would be  
**[0:10:22-0:10:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:10:22):**  disruptive.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:10:23):**  And I think for me, a lot of the challenges in the UK is this increasing distance we have  
**[0:10:29-0:10:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:10:29):**  between ourselves and our food.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:10:31):**  And that's literally what the food is.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:10:32):**  But of course, where it comes from, how it was produced, where it was grown, what the  
**[0:10:37-0:10:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:10:37):**  value of it is.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:10:38):**  I mean, we now, I think, spend quite a depressingly small amount of our household income on food.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:10:44):**  It's 9%.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:10:45):**  I mean, the only country that spends less is the US.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:10:49):**  And we know the quality there.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:10:50):**  Yeah.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:10:51):**  Yeah.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:10:52):**  It is also the fact that we have a really high percentage now of food in our baskets  
**[0:10:56-0:10:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:10:56):**  that's ultra processed.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:10:58):**  So I think for me, that's one part of it.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:11:00):**  The other part of it as well is also just over the years, the observation that I think  
**[0:11:04-0:11:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:11:04):**  food is very much becoming a bit like fashion.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:11:07):**  It's becoming labeled, it's becoming stylized, it's becoming something that's very much positioned  
**[0:11:13-0:11:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:11:13):**  as highly desirable, but desirable in its end form and for these sort of catchy benefits  
**[0:11:20-0:11:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:11:20):**  it might give you.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:11:21):**  You know, is it a superfood?  
**[0:11:22-0:11:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:11:22):**  Is it low in this?  
**[0:11:23-0:11:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:11:23):**  Is it high in that?  
**[0:11:24-0:11:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:11:24):**  And I just think that it's become quite moralized food.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:11:28):**  And it's also become kind of quite like a fad.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:11:31):**  And I think that those are again, other things that are distancing people from their food.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:11:36):**  So I guess it's a little bit.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:11:38):**  Partly because of ex-colleagues of you and obviously the marketing industry coming very  
**[0:11:43-0:11:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:11:43):**  involved in discovering ultra processed foods in many cases, but yeah, telling a story that  
**[0:11:48-0:11:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:11:48):**  hit a nerve with all of us, just like the fashion industry did 20 years ago or more.  
**[0:11:53-0:11:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:11:53):**  It became and becomes quite a, yeah, quite a different thing than a couple of years ago.  
**[0:11:57-0:11:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:11:57):**  Yes, I definitely agree.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:11:58):**  I definitely see myself as sort of perhaps a slightly reformed person from the ad industry  
**[0:12:04-0:12:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:12:04):**  because.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:12:05):**  Recovering.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:12:06):**  Yeah.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:12:07):**  Well, I think, yeah, looking for change anyway, I suppose, because it is true.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:12:10):**  I think the sort of the tentacles and effects of marketing and frankly consumerism have  
**[0:12:15-0:12:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:12:15):**  just basically gone too far.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:12:17):**  And so I think when we think about being a disruptive brand in agri-food, it's very much  
**[0:12:22-0:12:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:12:22):**  following the principles of regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:12:25):**  It's kind of almost, it is a sort of leaping forward by reflecting back to the past.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:12:31):**  And I think there is something to be said for, there can be quite a lot of disruption  
**[0:12:35-0:12:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:12:35):**  in actually just being incredibly honest, incredibly transparent and actually making  
**[0:12:42-0:12:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:12:42):**  food something that works as a system in a way that's really, really local and really  
**[0:12:47-0:12:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:12:47):**  connected to people and far more in tune with what they want and what they need.  
**[0:12:52-0:12:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:12:52):**  Because then you've started a cycle of inviting their input and then being able to further  
**[0:12:57-0:13:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:12:57):**  inform what they can expect from food, what quality food looks like and what quality food  
**[0:13:03-0:13:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:13:03):**  tastes like.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:13:04):**  To be a bit more specific on it, I think there is something disruptive actually in pricing  
**[0:13:09-0:13:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:13:09):**  of food.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:13:10):**  So the fact that the input costs for regenerative agriculture are 30% less, that for us is absolutely  
**[0:13:17-0:13:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:13:17):**  something that we would want to be able to transfer over to people so that they can appreciate  
**[0:13:22-0:13:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:13:22):**  local quality food can be very fairly priced, quite competitively priced.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:13:27):**  And I think the other thing is being able to do more of a comparison for people on true  
**[0:13:31-0:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:13:31):**  cost.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:13:32):**  So the idea, I do reference the fashion industry quite a bit having done work with it before,  
**[0:13:37-0:13:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:13:37):**  but you look at certain fashion brands and I just use this as an example I'm familiar  
**[0:13:42-0:13:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:13:42):**  with not necessarily saying it's the best, but there was quite a lot of disruption when  
**[0:13:45-0:13:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:13:45):**  Everlane as a fashion brand broke down what actually goes into the price of a t-shirt  
**[0:13:52-0:13:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:13:52):**  or a sweatshirt.  
**[0:13:53-0:14:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:13:53):**  And I really think trying to create more understanding with customers as to what goes into the cost  
**[0:14:00-0:14:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:14:00):**  of food, because I think you've immediately been disruptive in depositioning processed  
**[0:14:06-0:14:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:14:06):**  food and showing that a huge amount of what you pay for is that packaging, is that branding,  
**[0:14:13-0:14:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:14:13):**  is that logo, is that set of logistics that were involved in frankly taking a product  
**[0:14:19-0:14:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:14:19):**  from being very natural through to actually processing it to a point where it really no  
**[0:14:24-0:14:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:14:24):**  longer is.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:14:25):**  So is it something you're going to see in your products as well?  
**[0:14:29-0:14:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:14:29):**  Like that breakdown that clear where things go to, because I see a few fashion brands  
**[0:14:33-0:14:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:14:33):**  and a few other brands using that.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:14:35):**  I haven't seen the food yet.  
**[0:14:36-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:14:36):**  I mean, some mentioned, of course, this is how much goes to the farmer and compared like  
**[0:14:40-0:14:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:14:40):**  in coffee, there are some movements around that.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:14:43):**  Moji is doing that very nicely.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:14:44):**  How much stays actually in the country or not?  
**[0:14:46-0:14:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:14:46):**  How much travels outside?  
**[0:14:47-0:14:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:14:47):**  And is that something you're going to see on the packaging?  
**[0:14:50-0:14:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:14:50):**  Is that something we're going to see on the wall in the farm shop?  
**[0:14:53-0:14:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:14:53):**  How we're going to see that as customers in new foundation farms?  
**[0:14:56-0:15:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:14:56):**  Yeah, I mean, we are in development, so I probably couldn't say exactly where you'll  
**[0:15:00-0:15:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:15:00):**  see it.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:15:01):**  But the point is that you would be able to see that and have that as part of input stuff.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:15:07):**  Yes, as part of your decision making process, because I think in the end, there's an enormous  
**[0:15:13-0:15:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:15:13):**  amount of talk really across all of industry about people as consumers.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:15:18):**  And we don't subscribe to that, partly because I think the more you talk about consumers,  
**[0:15:23-0:15:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:15:23):**  the more you're taking people away from being creators.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:15:26):**  And I think the point here is that how do we empower people to feel more like citizen  
**[0:15:31-0:15:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:15:31):**  shoppers, where they understand the contribution that their money makes, because whether we  
**[0:15:36-0:15:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:15:36):**  like it or not, money is power.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:15:38):**  The point is it's somebody else's power, or whether it's yours.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:15:41):**  And the more information we can very simply and excessively give people, the more power  
**[0:15:47-0:15:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:15:47):**  they will have over their own decision making, but ultimately their food systems.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:15:51):**  And I think that when we think about the way in which we would like to develop new foundation  
**[0:15:55-0:16:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:15:55):**  farms from a first farm of 1000 acres, up to a series of hubs that we create across  
**[0:16:02-0:16:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:16:02):**  the UK with farms that are central, but then probably clusters of farms that we've either  
**[0:16:07-0:16:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:16:07):**  partnered with, or that we've helped support transition to regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:16:12):**  That's where also we've got these circles of influence that involve those local communities  
**[0:16:17-0:16:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:16:17):**  and those citizen shoppers.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:16:19):**  And that is part of why we think the model of development that we're going for will be  
**[0:16:25-0:16:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:16:25):**  disruptive and ideally will create positive change.  
**[0:16:29-0:16:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:16:29):**  So how is this different from your typical farm shop where you see the connection, like  
**[0:16:34-0:16:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:16:34):**  you visit a farm shop?  
**[0:16:36-0:16:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:16:36):**  In my imagination, I have yet to look at the numbers.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:16:39):**  It's typically fairly small, you buy a certain amount of products, and you have the connection  
**[0:16:44-0:16:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:16:44):**  to the land.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:16:45):**  Maybe you can even eat there, because in some cases, obviously, they added the restaurant  
**[0:16:49-0:16:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:16:49):**  part, which is very interesting for margins if you don't do it well.  
**[0:16:53-0:16:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:16:53):**  But it is also, I mean, accessibility is an issue.  
**[0:16:56-0:17:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:16:56):**  Customers are often interestingly high and not so accessible because you have to go,  
**[0:17:00-0:17:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:17:00):**  which immediately makes it inaccessible for a lot of people.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:17:03):**  And you're mentioning this disruptive part.  
**[0:17:06-0:17:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:17:06):**  So how do we envision, okay, how can I as a potential client in the future, in a year  
**[0:17:11-0:17:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:17:11):**  from now, at the end of this year, get access to food through New Foundation Farms?  
**[0:17:16-0:17:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:17:16):**  What's the experience like for the different types of customers?  
**[0:17:20-0:17:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:17:20):**  One of the main parts of the New Foundation Farms model is to be able to stack the different  
**[0:17:25-0:17:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:17:25):**  economic activities.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:17:26):**  So for the 1,000 acre first farm, we are planning to have 1,000 square meters of both processing  
**[0:17:34-0:17:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:17:34):**  and retail.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:17:35):**  So I think like you say, that is, I think the processing perhaps slightly less typical  
**[0:17:40-0:17:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:17:40):**  for a farm, but the retail, not necessarily.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:17:43):**  So I think that what we will be striving for is to have that shop experience, but also  
**[0:17:48-0:17:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:17:48):**  to have a cafe and a restaurant, because it's not just the transaction that is important.  
**[0:17:54-0:17:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:17:54):**  I think like we've talked about with-  
**[0:17:56-0:17:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:17:56):**  That can happen online.  
**[0:17:57-0:17:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:17:57):**  Yeah.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:17:58):**  With transparent pricing, it is also creating a sense of food culture.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:18:02):**  And I think that is vitally important because then you've created more points of connection  
**[0:18:07-0:18:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:18:07):**  for people than just, I've come in, I bought a product and I've left.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:18:11):**  And so there's two points I'd make about that.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:18:14):**  One from an accessibility point of view, like I said, I think we would be aiming for very  
**[0:18:18-0:18:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:18:18):**  fair pricing.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:18:19):**  But two also, I think the way in which we stock that shop obviously needs to be really  
**[0:18:25-0:18:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:18:25):**  considered because we are looking to become a replacement for the weekly grocery shop  
**[0:18:30-0:18:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:18:30):**  that people could do elsewhere.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:18:31):**  So I need to find almost everything there.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:18:33):**  Well, we would look to have kind of curated choice.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:18:36):**  So it's the things that people need, not necessarily lots of choice in each category.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:18:40):**  No, no, not 16 types of peanut butter.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:18:42):**  But yeah, at least I would like, yeah, you need to feel that you can do your weekly shopping,  
**[0:18:48-0:18:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:18:48):**  even if it's a bit more limited than the mega supermarket aisles that we're getting used  
**[0:18:52-0:18:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:18:52):**  to.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:18:53):**  And I think that's really where we would see there's two sides to the way people make decisions  
**[0:18:58-0:18:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:18:58):**  on there.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:18:59):**  One is a more emotive side and the other is a really practical side.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:19:02):**  And I think from my point of view and my experience, we really have to be very successful on the  
**[0:19:07-0:19:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:19:07):**  practical aspect.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:19:08):**  So that is, are we easy to visit?  
**[0:19:11-0:19:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:19:11):**  Are our prices fair?  
**[0:19:12-0:19:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:19:12):**  And also, is it as convenient as possible to buy from?  
**[0:19:15-0:19:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:19:15):**  And this is where the role for tech for us is really important.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:19:19):**  So this is why we have a really strong COO and CTO in Wayne, who I know you'll be hearing  
**[0:19:25-0:19:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:19:25):**  from in a later podcast.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:19:27):**  But you know, we don't want to be a charming place that you have to visit in person to  
**[0:19:32-0:19:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:19:32):**  be able to buy a few special things.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:19:34):**  You know, we would like to be somewhere where it's really easy for you to buy online and  
**[0:19:39-0:19:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:19:39):**  have the items delivered, but also then yes, to visit in person.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:19:43):**  So I think there's that side of it.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:19:45):**  And how do you see that split?  
**[0:19:46-0:19:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:19:46):**  Is it going to be 80-20?  
**[0:19:47-0:19:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:19:47):**  I don't know which side it's going to be 80-20.  
**[0:19:50-0:19:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:19:50):**  But in terms of this online explosion that obviously we have seen during COVID, like  
**[0:19:55-0:20:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:19:55):**  the meal box companies are going through the roof and supermarkets are scrambling to keep  
**[0:20:00-0:20:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:20:00):**  up with online.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:20:01):**  How do you see that split in terms of visiting versus maybe I visited once and then I continue  
**[0:20:06-0:20:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:20:06):**  to buy my weekly or monthly stuff through you and not visit necessarily every week?  
**[0:20:12-0:20:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:20:12):**  Yeah, so in the UK, actually, the uptake pre-COVID, the uptake of digital food delivery and so  
**[0:20:18-0:20:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:20:18):**  was actually surprisingly slow.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:20:21):**  And I think that is because it's taken time for people to adopt that behavior.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:20:26):**  There is also just something where particularly when it comes to food, people do still like  
**[0:20:30-0:20:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:20:30):**  to see the produce and make that choice.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:20:32):**  And we found, I think in the UK in particular, the weekly shop still happens, but increasingly  
**[0:20:37-0:20:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:20:37):**  people are just shopping for smaller number of items more often.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:20:41):**  I think that we could have a greater proportion of digital transactions, but actually in order  
**[0:20:49-0:20:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:20:49):**  to create the hubs that I mentioned and for those to be successfully replicated, but also  
**[0:20:54-0:20:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:20:54):**  for us to be achieving the social impact that we are striving for, we would really like  
**[0:20:59-0:21:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:20:59):**  to maintain a balance.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:21:00):**  And I think that's where the second part of the early question you asked around what would  
**[0:21:05-0:21:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:21:05):**  make the farm shop slightly different or more interesting.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:21:08):**  It is this point around food culture, because I think what we don't want to become is the  
**[0:21:13-0:21:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:21:13):**  sort of just replacement and that people purely do buy in the way they currently do, because  
**[0:21:18-0:21:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:21:18):**  that is part of the challenge is that there is not enough of an emotional connection.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:21:23):**  And I think an engagement of attention into food shopping.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:21:27):**  That's why I think we've managed to speed up the process of shopping and reduce the  
**[0:21:31-0:21:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:21:31):**  amount of time and kind of enthusiasm that can go into buying products.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:21:37):**  And I don't think it has to be that that is because about a cost thing.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:21:41):**  I think it's just largely about trying to create renewed appreciation for food, its  
**[0:21:47-0:21:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:21:47):**  quality and the role that it plays in your life.  
**[0:21:50-0:21:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:21:50):**  Prioritization.  
**[0:21:51-0:21:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:21:51):**  Yeah.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:21:52):**  So I think on the question of digital versus in real life, we'd hope to maintain a balance  
**[0:21:57-0:22:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:21:57):**  if it goes that there are more digital transactions over time, which hopefully there probably  
**[0:22:02-0:22:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:22:02):**  would be because there's something in that about convenience and about it being more  
**[0:22:06-0:22:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:22:06):**  likely that people could buy more regularly.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:22:08):**  But we would always want to also be bringing people to the site because it's the transparency  
**[0:22:14-0:22:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:22:14):**  by which we would share our farming process and encourage people to actually spend the  
**[0:22:18-0:22:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:22:18):**  time on the land that we're doing that more holistic, we're playing a more holistic role,  
**[0:22:24-0:22:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:22:24):**  I think, in foundation farms.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:22:26):**  I think it's going to be fascinating to see how that will shift and how often people will  
**[0:22:31-0:22:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:22:31):**  keep like, let's say, regular online customers.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:22:33):**  How often will they visit because not necessarily to do the shopping and it will do as well,  
**[0:22:37-0:22:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:22:37):**  but because of the experience and because of the food to eat there and because of the  
**[0:22:41-0:22:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:22:41):**  farm tour or because of XYZ and keep checking in, keep visiting just to make sure they have  
**[0:22:46-0:22:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:22:46):**  that connection compared to a pure online brand or a pure farm shop brand.  
**[0:22:52-0:22:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:22:52):**  I think that combination is going to be very interesting, challenging because they're very  
**[0:22:55-0:22:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:22:55):**  different beasts, but obviously also in terms of skill needed or necessary because you're  
**[0:22:59-0:23:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:22:59):**  just running between brackets because it's not easy.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:23:02):**  A farm shop could be very challenging in terms of quantity.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:23:05):**  You need to push through that to make sense, especially if you're operating a thousand  
**[0:23:08-0:23:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:23:08):**  acres.  
**[0:23:09-0:23:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:23:09):**  Yeah, that's true.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:23:10):**  I mean, but just, I suppose, as there is the diversity of produce that we're planning to  
**[0:23:15-0:23:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:23:15):**  farm, you know, true to regenerative agriculture principles in a way, the diversity of ways  
**[0:23:21-0:23:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:23:21):**  in which you could buy and what we look to sell, we think in the end it could become  
**[0:23:26-0:23:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:23:26):**  beneficial to have that rather than complex because one of the big parts of what we are  
**[0:23:32-0:23:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:23:32):**  and what we will work to achieve is to be able to, when we start and not having a lot  
**[0:23:37-0:23:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:23:37):**  of our own produce, we will be sourcing from local farmers.  
**[0:23:41-0:23:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:23:41):**  And that for us is a beneficial thing for increasing our network, being able to share  
**[0:23:45-0:23:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:23:45):**  the learnings and obviously then more easily having a diversity of products to sell.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:23:51):**  Because I think a lot of the way in which we will look to create change in the system  
**[0:23:55-0:23:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:23:55):**  is to be able to establish a sales platform that proves the market demand for regenerative  
**[0:23:59-0:24:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:23:59):**  agriculture, which is then an incentive for other farmers to transition.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:24:03):**  And how do you deal with, let's say those farmers are, maybe are in some part of the  
**[0:24:10-0:24:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:24:10):**  transition, but as nobody's done yet or nobody is a regenerative farmer, how do you deal  
**[0:24:15-0:24:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:24:15):**  with the fact that they might be still applying practices that you, let's say, are not in  
**[0:24:20-0:24:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:24:20):**  favor with or in a couple of years are definitely not doing on your farm?  
**[0:24:24-0:24:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:24:24):**  How do you going to choose between not supplying or not selling this produce as you know that  
**[0:24:29-0:24:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:24:29):**  the farmer is in a transition of phasing out XYZ or not using that anymore, but still might  
**[0:24:33-0:24:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:24:33):**  be using this this year?  
**[0:24:35-0:24:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:24:35):**  How do you deal with that in terms of maybe the customers are coming and expect a fully  
**[0:24:38-0:24:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:24:38):**  regenerative, whatever that means, supermarket ready and it is work in progress?  
**[0:24:43-0:24:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:24:43):**  Again, I think it's the transparency by which we present the product, because I think that  
**[0:24:49-0:24:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:24:49):**  we will of course be looking to source produce from mission aligned farmers that will be  
**[0:24:54-0:24:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:24:54):**  at some stage on the journey as we will also be.  
**[0:24:57-0:25:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:24:57):**  And I think it's about how honestly and easily we can share the information with customers  
**[0:25:04-0:25:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:25:04):**  around what that product is and what may have been used in the process of producing it.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:25:09):**  But obviously, hopefully being able to point out what wasn't used as well.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:25:12):**  So there's a lot of reason why claims drive marketing and drive preference.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:25:18):**  And a lot of it is because they're simplistic.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:25:21):**  They are the kind of things that people begin to recognize and then base their choices on.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:25:25):**  And I think we know we are aware of that.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:25:28):**  But I think it is about how you try and add just that bit more information but easily  
**[0:25:33-0:25:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:25:33):**  for people so that they understand that actually, it's not necessarily about that, whether it  
**[0:25:38-0:25:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:25:38):**  has a single accreditation or not.  
**[0:25:40-0:25:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:25:40):**  There's other things to be considered.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:25:42):**  And to be very honest as well, I think there is something in the fact that from a producer  
**[0:25:48-0:25:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:25:48):**  point of view, regenerative is very powerful.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:25:50):**  From a mainstream market point of view, regenerative is very little understood.  
**[0:25:55-0:25:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:25:55):**  So a lot of it actually, I think, comes down to language.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:25:58):**  So the idea of being able to have a positive impact on nature or help biodiversity or actually  
**[0:26:05-0:26:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:26:05):**  also one of the biggest drivers in the UK is the appreciation for local food.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:26:10):**  Local doesn't necessarily mean better, but it is part of the story that actually from  
**[0:26:15-0:26:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:26:15):**  the way we would look to be sourcing produce for the shop at New Foundation Farms, that  
**[0:26:19-0:26:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:26:19):**  will be important.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:26:21):**  So again, a lot of it, I think for us will come down to honesty, transparency, but just  
**[0:26:26-0:26:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:26:26):**  the nuance of language as well.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:26:28):**  That's a difficult one because everybody seems to be looking for, okay, can we come up with  
**[0:26:32-0:26:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:26:32):**  a Regen label?  
**[0:26:33-0:26:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:26:33):**  And then we just say, okay, this is Regen, that's not.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:26:36):**  And of course, by definition, that's very, very difficult or probably impossible because  
**[0:26:39-0:26:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:26:39):**  it is a journey.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:26:40):**  And it means it's not a yes or no question.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:26:43):**  But consumers are used to that, like it's either is organic or isn't, even though there  
**[0:26:46-0:26:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:26:46):**  are 50 shades of organic.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:26:48):**  We're very used to look at the package, okay, this is without that, or this is with that,  
**[0:26:52-0:26:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:26:52):**  and that's it.  
**[0:26:53-0:26:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:26:53):**  That journey is going to be very, very interesting and challenging, I can imagine.  
**[0:26:56-0:27:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:26:56):**  What do you see as the biggest challenge coming into this space, relatively fresh, but obviously  
**[0:27:01-0:27:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:27:01):**  with a lot of food and storytelling experience and marketing experience?  
**[0:27:05-0:27:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:27:05):**  Is that explaining the journey or taking the people on the journey?  
**[0:27:09-0:27:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:27:09):**  Is that keep answering the question, why there's no label?  
**[0:27:11-0:27:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:27:11):**  What do you see as the biggest challenge at the moment?  
**[0:27:14-0:27:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:27:14):**  I mean, that could be different in a couple of months, obviously.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:27:16):**  To clarify the question, do you mean the biggest challenge coming into selling regenerative  
**[0:27:22-0:27:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:27:22):**  produce?  
**[0:27:23-0:27:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:27:23):**  It could be the biggest challenge and opportunity.  
**[0:27:25-0:27:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:27:25):**  What do you see as with a different set of glasses, really looking at the marketing perspective,  
**[0:27:31-0:27:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:27:31):**  really look at the storytelling, really looking at how do we engage large groups of people,  
**[0:27:36-0:27:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:27:36):**  as you've done in the past with other brands and other work?  
**[0:27:38-0:27:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:27:38):**  What do you see as that interesting tension point where maybe it's a challenge now, and  
**[0:27:43-0:27:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:27:43):**  it could be a huge opportunity a year down the line or six months down the line when  
**[0:27:46-0:27:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:27:46):**  obviously a lot more things are clear because we're a bit in the dark at the moment?  
**[0:27:50-0:27:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:27:50):**  Yeah.  
**[0:27:51-0:27:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:27:51):**  So I think that one of the biggest things that drives marketing, to be honest, is a  
**[0:27:57-0:28:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:27:57):**  sense of, like we've mentioned already, reductionism.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:28:00):**  It is this idea of how simple can you make the message and how often and how many different  
**[0:28:06-0:28:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:28:06):**  ways can you repeat it?  
**[0:28:08-0:28:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:28:08):**  And I think that that is almost then equivalent to the problems with industrial agriculture.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:28:14):**  It has become simplistic in here's a set of inputs that you use.  
**[0:28:19-0:28:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:28:19):**  They come from a few sources, a few massive companies.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:28:23):**  That's where you might get your fertilizers and your antibiotics.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:28:26):**  And let's keep it simple because we're really focused on yield.  
**[0:28:30-0:28:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:28:30):**  Let's just do a few crops or a set of livestock on our land.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:28:34):**  And the diversity by which we need to approach regenerative farming is in real honesty, the  
**[0:28:40-0:28:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:28:40):**  diversity with which we need to approach the way in which we present the produce to people.  
**[0:28:46-0:28:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:28:46):**  Because I don't think I am too naive or idealist, but the bit that really attracted me to New  
**[0:28:52-0:28:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:28:52):**  Foundation Farms is this idea of pursuing a kind of action-based research approach.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:28:59):**  We really are setting out to, we will have our first 1000 acre farm and we will learn  
**[0:29:05-0:29:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:29:05):**  from that, I think, what are the best ways of doing this.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:29:09):**  But I think although our ambition is to go national, what I think is crucial in all of  
**[0:29:15-0:29:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:29:15):**  this is to create the importance of connections and of each customer that will become part  
**[0:29:22-0:29:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:29:22):**  of what we create at that first New Foundation Farm and to never forget that, I think.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:29:29):**  Because one of the challenges is how much scale for any business and brand weakens the  
**[0:29:34-0:29:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:29:34):**  individual human connections.  
**[0:29:37-0:29:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:29:37):**  And I say this obviously kind of, that sounds quite fundamental, but I do think that's true.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:29:42):**  So I actually think that the challenges really are more practical of how to establish our  
**[0:29:49-0:29:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:29:49):**  first farm really successfully in a way that shows that we really are interested in what  
**[0:29:54-0:30:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:29:54):**  the local community care about, who they are, how they might both shop from us or with us.  
**[0:30:01-0:30:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:30:01):**  And I think that that's the way in which we will model how our replication and our scaling  
**[0:30:07-0:30:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:30:07):**  will work well.  
**[0:30:08-0:30:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:30:08):**  So I do, I increasingly find myself seeing parallels between how to move from conventional  
**[0:30:14-0:30:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:30:14):**  agriculture to regenerative agriculture and frankly, how to then move from really commercial  
**[0:30:20-0:30:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:30:20):**  marketing and branding to something that feels more regenerative as a practice on that side  
**[0:30:25-0:30:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:30:25):**  as well.  
**[0:30:26-0:30:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:30:26):**  Yeah, I think what's going to be interesting because for many farm shops are the ones I  
**[0:30:31-0:30:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:30:31):**  know, I mean, the marketing of the communication happens because of the farmer and the owners.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:30:36):**  And that's usually a small team.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:30:38):**  I'm generalizing here, obviously, don't start writing if you have a big one, but it's usually  
**[0:30:42-0:30:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:30:42):**  they are the farmers or they are the story and they are et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:30:46-0:30:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:30:46):**  In this case, with 100 people working at some point there, it's going to be the interesting  
**[0:30:51-0:30:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:30:51):**  piece of how do you make all of them not ambassadors, but how do we make them really part of new  
**[0:30:56-0:31:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:30:56):**  foundation farms that they are the story as well, even though they might not be the typical  
**[0:31:01-0:31:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:31:01):**  organic farmer you've seen on packaging, which doesn't exist, by the way, but the ones that  
**[0:31:05-0:31:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:31:05):**  you see that we've created in terms of in our minds and in the videos and in the marketing  
**[0:31:09-0:31:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:31:09):**  we've seen, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:31:11):**  So how do you scale that without losing that personal story?  
**[0:31:14-0:31:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:31:14):**  Because all of them will have a personal story.  
**[0:31:16-0:31:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:31:16):**  And that's why it's so important to keep them obviously engaged very long term and to make  
**[0:31:20-0:31:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:31:20):**  them really part of it.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:31:21):**  So how does that that's going to be, I think, one of the interesting tensions to make sure  
**[0:31:25-0:31:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:31:25):**  to have a diverse story there, but still a sort of not central story, but a general holistic  
**[0:31:30-0:31:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:31:30):**  story, even though there are 100 different people or more that are going to share at  
**[0:31:34-0:31:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:31:34):**  your table at the shop at et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:31:38):**  Yeah.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:31:39):**  And I think the central story will be the themes that come from being a regenerative  
**[0:31:42-0:31:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:31:42):**  enterprise and regenerative farming.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:31:45):**  And I think a lot of that is soil is central and that that farming is for the good of many  
**[0:31:51-0:31:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:31:51):**  other things, not just the output of the produce.  
**[0:31:53-0:31:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:31:53):**  And that might be the rural community.  
**[0:31:55-0:31:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:31:55):**  That might be the biodiversity.  
**[0:31:57-0:31:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:31:57):**  That might be the water management.  
**[0:31:59-0:32:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:31:59):**  Of course, ultimately, there's a primacy to the quality of the produce, as that's what  
**[0:32:03-0:32:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:32:03):**  we're asking people to come in and buy.  
**[0:32:05-0:32:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:32:05):**  But I think it is making it feel more than just a transaction, more than just I'll hand  
**[0:32:11-0:32:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:32:11):**  over my money for this item that I'm going to make part of my meal.  
**[0:32:15-0:32:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:32:15):**  With these calories.  
**[0:32:16-0:32:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:32:16):**  Yeah, it is much broader than that, isn't it?  
**[0:32:18-0:32:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:32:18):**  And I think that's what we would look to have as central.  
**[0:32:21-0:32:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:32:21):**  And then very much, as you say, actually, when with our plan to have a cafe and a restaurant  
**[0:32:27-0:32:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:32:27):**  alongside the shop, and that's sort of over time, this food culture and making everyone  
**[0:32:33-0:32:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:32:33):**  that works in Newfoundation Farms feel a part of that and to have a connection to that,  
**[0:32:38-0:32:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:32:38):**  as you mentioned, we will have sort of up to and over 100 employees due to the model  
**[0:32:43-0:32:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:32:43):**  we have due to it being regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:32:46-0:32:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:32:46):**  But that idea as well, that just because perhaps your primary work is in the shop, we will  
**[0:32:52-0:32:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:32:52):**  work though for them to also have an experience on the land, I think, and to have their time  
**[0:32:58-0:33:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:32:58):**  as part of that process.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:33:00):**  Because I think then that does mean that the way in which they're able to talk about the  
**[0:33:04-0:33:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:33:04):**  produce and present it to people is just far more credible.  
**[0:33:07-0:33:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:33:07):**  So I think that for us as well is quite an important part of it.  
**[0:33:11-0:33:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:33:11):**  No, I think it's going to be fascinating and fundamental.  
**[0:33:14-0:33:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:33:14):**  And sometimes the stories will diverge and sometimes they won't.  
**[0:33:17-0:33:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:33:17):**  And it's going to be a very interesting part of letting go.  
**[0:33:20-0:33:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:33:20):**  And that's very much part of a regenerative or regeneration transition or journey.  
**[0:33:25-0:33:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:33:25):**  And you're not in control of everything.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:33:27):**  And that's OK.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:33:28):**  I want to be conscious of your time and end with a few questions that we always like to  
**[0:33:32-0:33:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:33:32):**  ask and start with a question definitely inspired by John Kemp.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:33:37):**  What do you believe to be true about regenerative agriculture that others don't?  
**[0:33:41-0:33:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:33:41):**  So where are you contrary?  
**[0:33:42-0:33:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:33:42):**  So I think on this, I actually think that there's something about regenerative agriculture  
**[0:33:48-0:33:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:33:48):**  where there's a lot of polarization and sort of labeling and moralizing around ways, both  
**[0:33:54-0:33:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:33:54):**  the farming, but also, I think that we've said in types of food.  
**[0:33:58-0:34:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:33:58):**  And I do think that there's something in regenerative agriculture that's so holistic in its approach  
**[0:34:03-0:34:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:34:03):**  that it can integrate and sort of transcend that, if you like, particularly because one  
**[0:34:09-0:34:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:34:09):**  of the dominant narratives here at the moment is around the challenges and issues with meat  
**[0:34:13-0:34:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:34:13):**  as compared to veganism as a way of eating.  
**[0:34:16-0:34:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:34:16):**  Whereas I guess the interconnectedness by which you farm and by which livestock and  
**[0:34:21-0:34:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:34:21):**  horticulture and all of those other aspects play a part in regenerative farming.  
**[0:34:26-0:34:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:34:26):**  I do think that there's something in that holistic approach that can rise above what  
**[0:34:31-0:34:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:34:31):**  maybe are the kind of combative and sort of contradictory narratives in food at the moment.  
**[0:34:38-0:34:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:34:38):**  I think a lot of work is needed there because it's, we really easily slip into those conversations  
**[0:34:44-0:34:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:34:44):**  and that basically battling each other from vegan to the mob grazing guys and girls.  
**[0:34:50-0:34:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:34:50):**  And I think it's just as in the fossil fuel industry, it's just delaying us.  
**[0:34:54-0:34:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:34:54):**  It's delaying to get to the point of regeneration.  
**[0:34:56-0:35:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:34:56):**  And it's exactly what, let's say, industrial extractive agriculture wants.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:35:00):**  So they keep feeding that with interesting reports that show all kinds of things that  
**[0:35:04-0:35:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:35:04):**  if you look at the data, it doesn't show it at all.  
**[0:35:07-0:35:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:35:07):**  But just to delay every day of delay is another week of selling industrial chickens.  
**[0:35:11-0:35:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:35:11):**  And that really works well.  
**[0:35:12-0:35:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:35:12):**  And then the other argument is you can never feed the world.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:35:14):**  It's like there are not enough calories and all of that, which has been, I think, debunked.  
**[0:35:18-0:35:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:35:18):**  I don't know how many times, but keeps surfacing and surfacing.  
**[0:35:21-0:35:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:35:21):**  So it's going to be very interesting to invite the hardcore vegans on a farm like that and  
**[0:35:26-0:35:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:35:26):**  see, have a context discussion with everyone involved.  
**[0:35:29-0:35:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:35:29):**  Like should we be eating the quantity of meat we're eating or the quality of meat?  
**[0:35:33-0:35:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:35:33):**  And that's a very, what is the role of animals if there is on this piece of land or this  
**[0:35:37-0:35:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:35:37):**  farm or this estate in this context and how would that be?  
**[0:35:41-0:35:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:35:41):**  Is that a separate question from should we eat or not eat?  
**[0:35:44-0:35:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:35:44):**  And what's the role?  
**[0:35:45-0:35:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:35:45):**  And probably there are two different questions, but that's not something you can fit on a  
**[0:35:48-0:35:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:35:48):**  one word billboard.  
**[0:35:49-0:35:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:35:49):**  I mean, context, maybe yes.  
**[0:35:50-0:35:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:35:50):**  Yeah.  
**[0:35:51-0:35:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:35:51):**  And I think we, you know, for new foundation farms, we take, I think, a holistic view  
**[0:35:55-0:35:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:35:55):**  on diet.  
**[0:35:56-0:36:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:35:56):**  And, you know, we look quite closely at something like the Eat Lancet report, which does talk  
**[0:36:01-0:36:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:36:01):**  about how key plant-based eating is.  
**[0:36:05-0:36:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:36:05):**  And you know, I think we do firmly believe that, but there is also a role for meat.  
**[0:36:09-0:36:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:36:09):**  And I think that we have no moralizing view on meat either, that livestock and animals  
**[0:36:14-0:36:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:36:14):**  are also a key part, aren't they, of the regenerative food system.  
**[0:36:18-0:36:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:36:18):**  I think the one challenge that I think I particularly feel at the moment is around the levels of  
**[0:36:24-0:36:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:36:24):**  investment in lab grown meat alternatives, because I think that's taking a huge amount  
**[0:36:29-0:36:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:36:29):**  of energy and interest, again, away from rural communities, rural areas, and frankly nature  
**[0:36:36-0:36:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:36:36):**  in the countryside.  
**[0:36:37-0:36:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:36:37):**  And that's what I think is, again, so hopeful in regenerative, but so needed is to try and  
**[0:36:43-0:36:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:36:43):**  again wean us off of view that the solutions will be human centric.  
**[0:36:47-0:36:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:36:47):**  And I think that's where us being able to rediscover that we are part of nature and  
**[0:36:53-0:36:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:36:53):**  that we should work as part of it and alongside it.  
**[0:36:56-0:37:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:36:56):**  That is one of the ways in which I think we will really hope to present New Foundation  
**[0:37:01-0:37:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:37:01):**  Farms as radically natural farming.  
**[0:37:04-0:37:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:37:04):**  So sort of irrespective of that specific term, it is looking to help people appreciate where  
**[0:37:10-0:37:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:37:10):**  we sit as humans within those natural systems and therefore what farming can mean when you  
**[0:37:16-0:37:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:37:16):**  look at it that way.  
**[0:37:17-0:37:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:37:17):**  Yeah, I think it's again, there's an interesting simplistic approach there.  
**[0:37:21-0:37:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:37:21):**  Like if we just invent lab meat, and I'm all for research and going deep in certain things,  
**[0:37:26-0:37:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:37:26):**  but it's a huge distraction because then the counterpart is let's just rewild everything  
**[0:37:29-0:37:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:37:29):**  else.  
**[0:37:30-0:37:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:37:30):**  But actually for rewilding, you need large animals, which is a very interesting contradiction.  
**[0:37:35-0:37:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:37:35):**  And it's a huge resource suck at the moment.  
**[0:37:38-0:37:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:37:38):**  Like we need smart people, we need smart money, we need a lot of things to dive deep into  
**[0:37:45-0:37:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:37:45):**  what's the role with us in nature and to really explore that.  
**[0:37:49-0:37:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:37:49):**  And there's so much more to discover there than in a lab-grown meat facility, but somehow  
**[0:37:54-0:37:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:37:54):**  the funding goes there and does the people and does the excitement.  
**[0:37:57-0:38:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:37:57):**  And definitely they're also going up the hype cycle at the moment.  
**[0:38:00-0:38:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:38:00):**  And again, I'm not against the research, but I think there are more interesting, there  
**[0:38:03-0:38:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:38:03):**  are deeper questions to ask about biodiversity, nature, how we feed ourselves, how we feed  
**[0:38:08-0:38:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:38:08):**  everything else.  
**[0:38:09-0:38:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:38:09):**  And these are not the deep questions.  
**[0:38:10-0:38:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:38:10):**  And I see people coming from there, like let's say moving on at some point because they start  
**[0:38:15-0:38:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:38:15):**  asking those deep questions.  
**[0:38:16-0:38:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:38:16):**  But it's a long journey and they get a lot of hype.  
**[0:38:19-0:38:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:38:19):**  Yeah.  
**[0:38:20-0:38:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:38:20):**  And I think actually to your question about soil, this idea that 25% of the world biodiversity  
**[0:38:26-0:38:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:38:26):**  is in the soil, like that then is really relatively undiscovered.  
**[0:38:30-0:38:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:38:30):**  And this idea, I think of trying to reposition insects and soil and that aspect of nature  
**[0:38:38-0:38:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:38:38):**  as innovative and as sources of progress.  
**[0:38:42-0:38:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:38:42):**  I think there is, and I say this, I suppose, from a storytelling branding perspective,  
**[0:38:46-0:38:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:38:46):**  but there's tremendous opportunity in that because I don't think that lab grown meat  
**[0:38:51-0:38:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:38:51):**  alternatives don't have a role.  
**[0:38:53-0:38:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:38:53):**  But I think like we've said, the level of interest, attention and funding that's going  
**[0:38:57-0:39:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:38:57):**  that way, it needs a counterbalance because I think that sort of approach to our food  
**[0:39:03-0:39:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:39:03):**  future as well as then combined with our rates of urbanization, it does, I think, leave us  
**[0:39:09-0:39:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:39:09):**  feeling like we've disconnected even more.  
**[0:39:12-0:39:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:39:12):**  Yeah.  
**[0:39:13-0:39:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:39:13):**  I think we're turning our backs on a tremendous amount of value, both economically and socially,  
**[0:39:19-0:39:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:39:19):**  as well as it being something that needs much more of our energy ecologically.  
**[0:39:24-0:39:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:39:24):**  And so that's actually a great bridge to the next question.  
**[0:39:27-0:39:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:39:27):**  If you had a magic wand and you could change one thing in the ag and food industry or in  
**[0:39:31-0:39:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:39:31):**  general, but what would you change?  
**[0:39:32-0:39:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:39:32):**  Could be consciousness, could be changing food labeling, could be in fact, could be  
**[0:39:37-0:39:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:39:37):**  anything, but only one.  
**[0:39:39-0:39:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:39:39):**  What would you do?  
**[0:39:40-0:39:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:39:40):**  I mean, unsurprisingly, actually, I think I would look at the branding of it and how  
**[0:39:45-0:39:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:39:45):**  it's presented because I do think, you know, one of the methodologies used in the branding  
**[0:39:51-0:39:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:39:51):**  world is semiotics.  
**[0:39:52-0:39:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:39:52):**  Explain what is semiotics.  
**[0:39:54-0:39:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:39:54):**  Yes.  
**[0:39:55-0:40:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:39:55):**  So it's a way of analyzing and looking at how a theme or a topic is presented and therefore  
**[0:40:03-0:40:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:40:03):**  how people perceive it.  
**[0:40:05-0:40:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:40:05):**  That's a very simplistic definition.  
**[0:40:07-0:40:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:40:07):**  I'm sure a listener would be able to give a better one, but I will try to put a link  
**[0:40:11-0:40:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:40:11):**  in the show notes to something.  
**[0:40:12-0:40:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:40:12):**  Yeah, I'll send one.  
**[0:40:13-0:40:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:40:13):**  Yeah, please.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:40:14):**  But there's something about the semiotics of agriculture where it just seems quite utilitarian.  
**[0:40:20-0:40:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:40:20):**  You see a lot of machinery.  
**[0:40:22-0:40:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:40:22):**  It's quite masculine.  
**[0:40:23-0:40:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:40:23):**  It's sort of, to be really honest, looks a bit like it's humans tidying up the countryside  
**[0:40:29-0:40:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:40:29):**  for the benefit of being incredibly productive.  
**[0:40:31-0:40:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:40:31):**  So you have that or you have something that really is charming of a previous era, but  
**[0:40:39-0:40:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:40:39):**  all sort of quite small and friendly, something another set of people tend to do, but probably  
**[0:40:45-0:40:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:40:45):**  not you, the viewer.  
**[0:40:47-0:40:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:40:47):**  And I think that both of those ways of presenting agriculture and farming make it feel distanced  
**[0:40:52-0:40:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:40:52):**  from people, don't make it feel like it has energy and can be progressive.  
**[0:40:58-0:41:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:40:58):**  And I think when we think about the future that agriculture can play for us, I think  
**[0:41:04-0:41:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:41:04):**  finding other ways to present it with more diversity so that more different people could  
**[0:41:09-0:41:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:41:09):**  see it as something that they could do.  
**[0:41:11-0:41:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:41:11):**  And I think also, frankly, more indignation and interest from the public actually around  
**[0:41:17-0:41:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:41:17):**  the cost of land as well, because again, the semiotics of the way agriculture and farming  
**[0:41:23-0:41:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:41:23):**  is presented to us is also part of the problem around how inaccessible UK land is now due  
**[0:41:30-0:41:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:41:30):**  to its cost.  
**[0:41:31-0:41:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:41:31):**  So I personally would love to be able to make those sorts of changes so that more people  
**[0:41:38-0:41:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:41:38):**  understood the value of agriculture and farming, more people saw it as something they could  
**[0:41:43-0:41:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:41:43):**  actually even do themselves.  
**[0:41:45-0:41:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:41:45):**  And they actually saw, recognized more of the role of that industry in the national  
**[0:41:50-0:41:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:41:50):**  interest and in our future.  
**[0:41:53-0:41:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:41:53):**  And to be honest, there is definitely that part of what we can and hope to do with You  
**[0:41:59-0:42:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:41:59):**  Foundation Farms is to present agriculture and food production in a different way.  
**[0:42:06-0:42:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:42:06):**  And that is ideally really complimentary to a lot of what farmers are already doing in  
**[0:42:11-0:42:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:42:11):**  running their successful farm shops and so on.  
**[0:42:13-0:42:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:42:13):**  It's just perhaps that we have a slightly different entrepreneurial mindset, but also  
**[0:42:17-0:42:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:42:17):**  a slightly different skill set in the team that means that as part of the network that  
**[0:42:23-0:42:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:42:23):**  we do feel part of, we can help do that on a larger scale.  
**[0:42:27-0:42:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:42:27):**  I'm laughing because I'm asking a regular listener would notice by now I'm asking these  
**[0:42:32-0:42:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:42:32):**  questions in the other order.  
**[0:42:33-0:42:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:42:33):**  And there's actually a perfect bridge to the next question.  
**[0:42:36-0:42:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:42:36):**  What would you do if you would be in charge of so maybe the order all along was wrong,  
**[0:42:40-0:42:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:42:40):**  the interviews we did so far, but what would you do with a billion dollar or billion pounds  
**[0:42:45-0:42:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:42:45):**  let's investment fund because you touched upon land.  
**[0:42:48-0:42:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:42:48):**  I'm making an assumption here that you go in that direction.  
**[0:42:51-0:42:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:42:51):**  But what if you would wake up tomorrow morning as an investment manager of quite a large  
**[0:42:54-0:42:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:42:54):**  investment fund?  
**[0:42:55-0:42:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:42:55):**  It has to be invested, meaning it has to come back at some point could be without a return  
**[0:42:59-0:43:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:42:59):**  could be a zero, a zero percent return, but it has to come back.  
**[0:43:03-0:43:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:43:03):**  What would you, Kirstie, focus on?  
**[0:43:05-0:43:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:43:05):**  I'm going to try and answer this.  
**[0:43:07-0:43:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:43:07):**  Let's see.  
**[0:43:08-0:43:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:43:08):**  I think that one of the most fundamental things that we could do is actually about having  
**[0:43:14-0:43:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:43:14):**  more impact for children on the food that they experience at an early age.  
**[0:43:21-0:43:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:43:21):**  Because I think so much of it starts with the food that you experience from a young  
**[0:43:26-0:43:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:43:26):**  age and the meal time experience that you have with that.  
**[0:43:31-0:43:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:43:31):**  And for me, actually this line of thinking as well, it's massive credit to my former  
**[0:43:35-0:43:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:43:35):**  boss and the CEO of Leon, John Vincent, because he and his co-founder, Henry Dimbleby worked  
**[0:43:43-0:43:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:43:43):**  on the school food plan.  
**[0:43:45-0:43:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:43:45):**  And that was looking at the fact that the economics for the government are better if  
**[0:43:49-0:43:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:43:49):**  they provide free infant school meals.  
**[0:43:52-0:43:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:43:52):**  And I really firmly believe that.  
**[0:43:54-0:43:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:43:54):**  And it's something that I care quite a lot about because I have children, they're at  
**[0:43:58-0:44:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:43:58):**  the primary school age where they do get their food at school.  
**[0:44:02-0:44:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:44:02):**  But I just think that that is so formative to children being introduced to different  
**[0:44:06-0:44:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:44:06):**  types of vegetables and tasting what quality food can be.  
**[0:44:10-0:44:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:44:10):**  So I would say there's a lot of work later on because you mentioned the retasting or  
**[0:44:15-0:44:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:44:15):**  learning how to taste, but it's a lot more difficult when you're 25 or 30 or plus compared  
**[0:44:20-0:44:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:44:20):**  to when you're five.  
**[0:44:22-0:44:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:44:22):**  To be really honest, yeah, once you're out of childhood, it's much, much harder to develop  
**[0:44:27-0:44:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:44:27):**  an interest in more diverse flavors and understand quality food.  
**[0:44:31-0:44:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:44:31):**  So for me, investment in a really quality school food meal system that would also extend  
**[0:44:39-0:44:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:44:39):**  to home economics being taught in school, but that investment would actually drive the  
**[0:44:44-0:44:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:44:44):**  supply chain and drive an increase of quality.  
**[0:44:47-0:44:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:44:47):**  That's a long term supply chain investment.  
**[0:44:49-0:44:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:44:49):**  Yeah, it is.  
**[0:44:50-0:44:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:44:50):**  It's a long term investment, but it would also improve the culture of food in schools.  
**[0:44:55-0:44:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:44:55):**  You know, there's a brilliant organization here in the UK called Chefs in Schools, which  
**[0:44:58-0:45:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:44:58):**  encourages trained chefs to work in schools and just increase the pride in that preparation.  
**[0:45:04-0:45:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:45:04):**  And the quality.  
**[0:45:05-0:45:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:45:05):**  Yeah.  
**[0:45:06-0:45:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:45:06):**  And obviously it saves costs that goes to our health service.  
**[0:45:11-0:45:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:45:11):**  So I don't really know that this is the neatest answer you'll have ever had.  
**[0:45:15-0:45:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:45:15):**  But for me, that's where I'd go.  
**[0:45:17-0:45:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:45:17):**  And it would be a long, long term investment.  
**[0:45:19-0:45:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:45:19):**  It is likely to not come back with return, but it would support, I think, a supply chain,  
**[0:45:25-0:45:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:45:25):**  a whole system that takes more pride and can better prepare the food.  
**[0:45:29-0:45:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:45:29):**  And then actually you would ultimately be helping produce more discerning citizen shoppers  
**[0:45:35-0:45:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:45:35):**  when they reach adulthood, who then essentially will help lift the whole food system with  
**[0:45:40-0:45:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:45:40):**  the kind of food that they are interested in and prepared to pay for.  
**[0:45:44-0:45:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:45:44):**  I think it's definitely the first time somebody mentioned children food system, but there  
**[0:45:48-0:45:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:45:48):**  is for sure a way to figure out how to make this an investment.  
**[0:45:52-0:45:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:45:52):**  In a sense, there's a lot of work being done on social impact bonds, which are not bonds,  
**[0:45:55-0:45:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:45:55):**  but like basically outcome payment schemes.  
**[0:45:58-0:46:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:45:58):**  And as you mentioned, investing in this actually saves all of us a lot of money.  
**[0:46:02-0:46:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:46:02):**  So the big challenge is not necessarily doing the food part, but it's figuring out how some  
**[0:46:07-0:46:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:46:07):**  of the money that's being saved, only a small percentage is probably needed, flows back  
**[0:46:11-0:46:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:46:11):**  to fund the whole scheme.  
**[0:46:13-0:46:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:46:13):**  And that's something that financial wizards have been figuring out for centuries.  
**[0:46:18-0:46:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:46:18):**  So that's not the impossible part.  
**[0:46:20-0:46:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:46:20):**  And I think a big part of this whole food as medicine or healthy food, and we actually  
**[0:46:25-0:46:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:46:25):**  did an interview with medically tailored meals with Catherine Koucho, I'll put it in the  
**[0:46:30-0:46:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:46:30):**  links below.  
**[0:46:31-0:46:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:46:31):**  And like the savings are so enormous, and we're starting to slowly figure out that not  
**[0:46:36-0:46:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:46:36):**  necessarily ultra processed food actually is helping that we're going to be figuring  
**[0:46:40-0:46:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:46:40):**  out how to pay for those programs and how to pay for that.  
**[0:46:44-0:46:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:46:44):**  So I think it's an excellent answer to be honest.  
**[0:46:46-0:46:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:46:46):**  And we're now joined by Mark Drouill, the executive chair of New Foundation Farms.  
**[0:46:50-0:46:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:46:50):**  And we're going to do a few small updates and small tidbits at the end of the interview  
**[0:46:55-0:46:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:46:55):**  with Kirsti.  
**[0:46:56-0:46:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:46:56):**  First of all, welcome back, Mark.  
**[0:46:57-0:47:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:46:57):**  And can you share a few updates fresh off the roadshow train, which obviously is virtual.  
**[0:47:02-0:47:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:47:02):**  But over the last week since we last talked, any updates, interesting meetings you had,  
**[0:47:06-0:47:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:47:06):**  anything you can share, obviously, what has happened in fundraising land as you're raising  
**[0:47:10-0:47:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:47:10):**  20 million?  
**[0:47:11-0:47:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:47:11):**  Hi again, Kun.  
**[0:47:12-0:47:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:47:12):**  Yeah, it's great to be back.  
**[0:47:14-0:47:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:47:14):**  The journey continues.  
**[0:47:15-0:47:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:47:15):**  And since we last spoke, we've been focusing a lot on the question of understanding impact.  
**[0:47:25-0:47:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:47:25):**  So for the first two months of the roadshow, most of the conversations have been about  
**[0:47:31-0:47:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:47:31):**  the money.  
**[0:47:32-0:47:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:47:32):**  It's been all about how does the economics of this proposition work?  
**[0:47:38-0:47:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:47:38):**  That makes perfect sense when you're talking to people about deploying a significant amount  
**[0:47:43-0:47:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:47:43):**  of capital and wanting to offer a return on that, at least a significant portion of it,  
**[0:47:49-0:47:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:47:49):**  it's important that the numbers stack up.  
**[0:47:51-0:47:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:47:51):**  But the last week, last 10 days have been very focused on this issue of impact.  
**[0:47:54-0:48:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:47:54):**  And the reason is, we've been talking in much more detail to a bunch of foundations.  
**[0:48:00-0:48:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:48:00):**  And that's thrown up some really interesting challenges, because the response is, okay,  
**[0:48:05-0:48:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:48:05):**  yeah, we get the economics, that's super.  
**[0:48:07-0:48:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:48:07):**  But talk to us about the impact of this.  
**[0:48:11-0:48:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:48:11):**  Because what you're talking about is a complete systems change.  
**[0:48:14-0:48:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:48:14):**  It's not just about changing the production paradigm in the way we grow food.  
**[0:48:19-0:48:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:48:19):**  It's also changing the journey between the field and the fork.  
**[0:48:25-0:48:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:48:25):**  And the consequence of that is a complete transition from a sort of industrial monoculture  
**[0:48:30-0:48:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:48:30):**  paradigm with big corporations, sourcing food everywhere, screwing the farmers on price,  
**[0:48:37-0:48:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:48:37):**  and then shipping it off to faceless supermarkets.  
**[0:48:40-0:48:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:48:40):**  It's actually about reconnecting food everywhere locally, growing much more diverse produce  
**[0:48:44-0:48:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:48:44):**  and delivering it primarily in a local context.  
**[0:48:48-0:48:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:48:48):**  And that's a radical kind of mental shift that people have to make.  
**[0:48:52-0:48:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:48:52):**  And so when you talk about impact, you find yourself saying, okay, well, we can talk about,  
**[0:48:56-0:49:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:48:56):**  you know, the amount of carbon sequestrated on land, or how many farmers are trained and  
**[0:49:01-0:49:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:49:01):**  educated or how the food narrative changes because of the way you have better choices  
**[0:49:06-0:49:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:49:06):**  for food.  
**[0:49:07-0:49:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:49:07):**  But overall, the big picture here is this is about a complete systems change.  
**[0:49:12-0:49:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:49:12):**  And it's quite an interesting challenge for foundation capital to think about that, because  
**[0:49:16-0:49:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:49:16):**  generally they look at interventions.  
**[0:49:19-0:49:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:49:19):**  Yeah, specific interventions.  
**[0:49:20-0:49:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:49:20):**  So how much carbon are you going to capture?  
**[0:49:22-0:49:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:49:22):**  And we say, well, you know, a lot because we changed the whole system.  
**[0:49:26-0:49:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:49:26):**  But it's not because we changed the whole system.  
**[0:49:28-0:49:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:49:28):**  It's because by showing what's possible, everyone changes.  
**[0:49:31-0:49:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:49:31):**  And that's the sort of the highest level of impact investing people want to get to.  
**[0:49:35-0:49:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:49:35):**  How do you change through an investment?  
**[0:49:37-0:49:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:49:37):**  Or in this case, it could be a mix, obviously, of land and capital.  
**[0:49:40-0:49:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:49:40):**  How do you change the system?  
**[0:49:41-0:49:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:49:41):**  But and then how do you respond?  
**[0:49:42-0:49:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:49:42):**  Because I think the second question will be, okay, great, you're gonna have a lot of impact.  
**[0:49:46-0:49:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:49:46):**  How are you going to measure or what are you going to measure?  
**[0:49:49-0:49:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:49:49):**  Because in the world of impact measurement and management, there's a world, let's say.  
**[0:49:53-0:49:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:49:53):**  What is your response there when that question comes?  
**[0:49:56-0:50:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:49:56):**  Yeah, so I'm going to ask Kirsty to respond to that, because we yesterday did a presentation  
**[0:50:00-0:50:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:50:00):**  to six big foundations.  
**[0:50:03-0:50:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:50:03):**  And Kirsty led on that, exactly answering that question.  
**[0:50:06-0:50:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:50:06):**  So take us away.  
**[0:50:07-0:50:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:50:07):**  Yeah, so I think as Mark was saying, it is taking the same holistic approach really,  
**[0:50:13-0:50:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:50:13):**  in the way that we would talk about and design the measurement of impacts as we're taking  
**[0:50:17-0:50:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:50:17):**  the farming approach and farming plan.  
**[0:50:20-0:50:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:50:20):**  So I think just to talk through some of the different layers of impact, if you like, there  
**[0:50:25-0:50:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:50:25):**  is a course fundamentally, there's the soil health and how we measure the different characteristics  
**[0:50:29-0:50:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:50:29):**  of that and its improvement.  
**[0:50:31-0:50:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:50:31):**  There's ecosystem health and the fact that we're using the ecological health index to  
**[0:50:35-0:50:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:50:35):**  be able to see ourselves move along on that journey.  
**[0:50:38-0:50:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:50:38):**  So very specifically, as everyone will know, seeing it as a journey, not a specific endpoint.  
**[0:50:43-0:50:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:50:43):**  But I think also it's because we've got the agri-food model at New Foundation Farms, it  
**[0:50:48-0:50:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:50:48):**  is also being able to think about all the way through to the human health and the social  
**[0:50:53-0:50:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:50:53):**  health.  
**[0:50:54-0:50:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:50:54):**  So from a human health point of view, it is thinking about the diversity of produce that  
**[0:50:58-0:51:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:50:58):**  we produce on New Foundation Farms, but also that we will sell.  
**[0:51:02-0:51:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:51:02):**  So how are we introducing people to that idea that we refer quite a lot to Tim Spector and  
**[0:51:09-0:51:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:51:09):**  the idea of eating 30 different types of plants each week, that really is what helps support  
**[0:51:15-0:51:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:51:15):**  a healthy gut.  
**[0:51:16-0:51:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:51:16):**  So for us, as much of different produce as possible rather than just produce that is  
**[0:51:22-0:51:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:51:22):**  processed in different ways, thinking about its nutrient density, how can we be monitoring  
**[0:51:28-0:51:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:51:28):**  that and actually letting people know because a carrot isn't just the same as another carrot  
**[0:51:32-0:51:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:51:32):**  this is part of the real promise of regenerative agriculture is the nutrient density over time  
**[0:51:38-0:51:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:51:38):**  the produce.  
**[0:51:39-0:51:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:51:39):**  And of course, then there's repeat customers and there's the time in nature.  
**[0:51:43-0:51:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:51:43):**  And that's where the invite we will have to people is don't just visit to buy, visit to  
**[0:51:48-0:51:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:51:48):**  spend time across the farm, depending on how much time you have, but being able to come  
**[0:51:53-0:51:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:51:53):**  into contact with part of the production or part of the landscape that we'll be cultivating.  
**[0:51:59-0:52:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:51:59):**  There is social health and so there's a really interesting emergence, particularly in the  
**[0:52:04-0:52:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:52:04):**  UK of nature prescribing.  
**[0:52:06-0:52:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:52:06):**  So how can we play a part in supporting that and being able to further create connections  
**[0:52:11-0:52:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:52:11):**  for people with nature for their mental well-being.  
**[0:52:14-0:52:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:52:14):**  From an economic health perspective, it's not just the economic health of new foundation  
**[0:52:19-0:52:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:52:19):**  farms as an enterprise, it's also the employment we can offer.  
**[0:52:22-0:52:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:52:22):**  So rising well above the five or six employees that's typical for an 850 acre farm up to  
**[0:52:29-0:52:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:52:29):**  above a hundred because we've got these stacked economic activities.  
**[0:52:33-0:52:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:52:33):**  But within that, looking to make sure that there is a real diversity of the people that  
**[0:52:37-0:52:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:52:37):**  we can employ that can be working with us and also apprenticeships.  
**[0:52:41-0:52:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:52:41):**  There is a real challenge in the UK industry of agriculture that it's the least diverse  
**[0:52:45-0:52:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:52:45):**  industry nationally.  
**[0:52:48-0:52:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:52:48):**  So we want to make sure we're playing a part in changing that.  
**[0:52:51-0:52:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:52:51):**  But all of this and our model ladders up to the system change.  
**[0:52:54-0:53:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:52:54):**  So how are we directly and indirectly increasing the acreage of land that's farmed regeneratively?  
**[0:53:02-0:53:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:53:02):**  And a lot of this then brings in the fact that we will be educating farmers in partnership  
**[0:53:06-0:53:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:53:06):**  with 3LM.  
**[0:53:07-0:53:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:53:07):**  And also just inspiring, I think, with case studies and the learnings that we will look  
**[0:53:12-0:53:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:53:12):**  to share as transparently as we can, as we really are doing in this series with you.  
**[0:53:17-0:53:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:53:17):**  And from a really macro level, I'm just very aware and clear on the fact that a massive  
**[0:53:23-0:53:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:53:23):**  shift in the agri-food industry can actually contribute to all of the sustainable development  
**[0:53:28-0:53:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:53:28):**  goals.  
**[0:53:29-0:53:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:53:29):**  So we can actually contribute to 10 of them directly and seven of them indirectly.  
**[0:53:34-0:53:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:53:34):**  So for us, it's kind of all, it is literally from the ground up, but really considering  
**[0:53:39-0:53:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:53:39):**  as consciously as we can what's happening at each layer of the enterprise, both for  
**[0:53:44-0:53:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:53:44):**  the way it will operate, but also how it can increase the impact over time.  
**[0:53:48-0:53:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:53:48):**  And when you presented this yesterday on the call with the foundations, what was the response  
**[0:53:54-0:53:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:53:54):**  and what were the questions about, if there were any questions?  
**[0:53:57-0:54:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:53:57):**  At some level, we're a social enterprise because we're purpose driven.  
**[0:54:00-0:54:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:54:00):**  Okay.  
**[0:54:01-0:54:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:54:01):**  But also we have this profit motive.  
**[0:54:03-0:54:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:54:03):**  And overall, there's always the question of making sure that foundation money is being  
**[0:54:08-0:54:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:54:08):**  used genuinely to drive change and not to make the cost of capital lower for a business.  
**[0:54:15-0:54:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:54:15):**  Sponsoring some investment.  
**[0:54:16-0:54:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:54:16):**  Yeah.  
**[0:54:17-0:54:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:54:17):**  So, you know, if we give you grant money, does that mean then that you're making somebody  
**[0:54:22-0:54:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:54:22):**  else's returns higher?  
**[0:54:25-0:54:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:54:25):**  So that's the kind of, there's a sort of underlying narrative question that always exists with  
**[0:54:29-0:54:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:54:29):**  foundations that's important to get to the nub of.  
**[0:54:32-0:54:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:54:32):**  So a big part of the conversation really stems around motive and values.  
**[0:54:39-0:54:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:54:39):**  And we've noticed this a lot in the regenerative space is it's, we find it very easy to notice  
**[0:54:45-0:54:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:54:45):**  the difference between those who are driven in what they're doing by a deep conviction  
**[0:54:52-0:54:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:54:52):**  that we should do something differently.  
**[0:54:54-0:54:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:54:54):**  And those who are driven by the opportunity that this is the next best thing, you know,  
**[0:54:58-0:54:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:54:58):**  the next new gravy train.  
**[0:54:59-0:55:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:54:59):**  The consequence of that is really the difference between, do I tweak the system in order to  
**[0:55:04-0:55:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:55:04):**  persuade people to give me a bucket of money to make myself rich?  
**[0:55:09-0:55:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:55:09):**  Or am I doing something that is with humility at the beginning of a journey of fundamental  
**[0:55:15-0:55:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:55:15):**  transition?  
**[0:55:16-0:55:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:55:16):**  Which could take decades and more.  
**[0:55:17-0:55:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:55:17):**  Yeah, it could take decades to come.  
**[0:55:18-0:55:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:55:18):**  And it's a real challenge because the good news is that foundations are really focused  
**[0:55:22-0:55:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:55:22):**  on that latter logic.  
**[0:55:24-0:55:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:55:24):**  Their discernment is all about trying to figure out.  
**[0:55:26-0:55:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:55:26):**  Trying to filter out the other ones.  
**[0:55:28-0:55:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:55:28):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:55:29-0:55:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:55:29):**  So that's the kind of, I guess the meta thing that underlies when you talk about impact.  
**[0:55:34-0:55:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:55:34):**  It's very much around understanding the motive in a world where we're all innovating in just  
**[0:55:39-0:55:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:55:39):**  scratching the surface of what's possible.  
**[0:55:41-0:55:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:55:41):**  Thank you both so much for coming on at the back of this interview and shining light on  
**[0:55:47-0:55:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:55:47):**  an impact discussion that for sure could be a full other interview and probably a few  
**[0:55:51-0:55:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:55:51):**  of them.  
**[0:55:52-0:55:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:55:52):**  As impact management and measurement is a whole within itself.  
**[0:55:55-0:56:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:55:55):**  But thank you so much for giving us a teaser and definitely we'll be digging deeper into

**[0:57:23-0:57:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:57:23):**  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[0:57:27-0:57:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:57:27):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  
**[0:57:31-0:57:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:57:31):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[0:57:32-0:57:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:57:32):**  After a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of audio asking the question  
**[0:57:36-0:57:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:57:36):**  how to put money to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011  
**[0:57:41-0:57:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:57:41):**  and recording this podcast since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  
**[0:57:46-0:57:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:57:46):**  What have we seen in the space over the last years?

**[0:58:24-0:58:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:58:24):**  People that are building soil at scale.  
**[0:58:26-0:58:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:58:26):**  And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office  
**[0:58:30-0:58:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:58:30):**  or as private individuals or people who are putting other people's money to work through

**[0:58:40-0:58:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:58:40):**  No.  
**[0:58:41-0:58:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:58:41):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:58:43-0:58:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:58:43):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you and I'm very aware  
**[0:58:48-0:58:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:58:48):**  that among the listeners of this podcast we have people with very different means.  
**[0:58:53-0:58:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:58:53):**  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[0:58:58-0:59:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:58:58):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[0:59:01-0:59:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:59:01):**  Thank you.  
**[0:59:02-0:59:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:59:02):**  So what is this course?  
**[0:59:03-0:59:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:59:03):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  
**[0:59:09-0:59:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:59:09):**  so you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:59:11-0:59:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:59:11):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:59:16-0:59:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:59:16):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:59:22-0:59:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:59:22):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[0:59:26-0:59:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:59:26):**  if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:59:28-0:59:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:59:28):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:59:33-0:59:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:59:33):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:59:37-0:59:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:59:37):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:59:42-0:59:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:59:42):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:59:43-0:59:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:59:43):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:59:45-0:59:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:59:45):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:59:47-0:59:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:59:47):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:59:51-0:59:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:59:51):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:59:53-0:59:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:59:53):**  Before making any investment please find professional investment advice.  
**[0:59:58-1:00:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kirsty-saddler#t=0:59:58):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking.

**[0:00:13-0:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:00:13):**  Tell us everything you thought you knew about US agriculture, the family farm myth and successful  
**[0:00:19-0:00:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:00:19):**  regenerative farmers.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:00:21):**  And take a deep dive into the good, the bad and the ugly.  
**[0:00:24-0:00:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:00:24):**  Why should we treat farming as a business and why indigenous people should run them?  
**[0:00:30-0:00:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:00:30):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture â€“ Investing as  
**[0:00:34-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:00:34):**  if the Planet Mattered, a podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative  
**[0:00:38-0:00:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:00:38):**  food and agriculture space to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate  
**[0:00:43-0:00:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:00:43):**  soil, people, local communities and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:00:50):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:52-0:00:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:00:52):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:00:56-0:00:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:00:56):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:00:59):**  And it's time that we, as investors, big and small, and consumers, start paying much  
**[0:01:03-0:01:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:01:03):**  more attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.

**[0:01:34-0:01:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:01:34):**  Welcome to another interview today with Sarah Mock, Head of Marketing and Communication  
**[0:01:38-0:01:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:01:38):**  at Sylvan Aqua Farms and a freelance farmer world researcher and the writer of Farming  
**[0:01:42-0:01:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:01:42):**  and Other Efforts.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:01:43):**  Welcome Sarah.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:01:44):**  Hey, thanks for having me.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:01:45):**  I'm so excited to be here.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:01:47):**  I'm very much looking forward to this interview, but I want to start with a personal question.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:01:51):**  Actually, I'm also interested in the personal side of this.  
**[0:01:54-0:01:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:01:54):**  Why are you going so deep in ag and soil?  
**[0:01:57-0:02:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:01:57):**  So I actually grew up on a small family farm in Wyoming.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:02:01):**  So my roots go all the way back to the beginning.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:02:04):**  And you know, before I went off to college, I kind of felt like I was that the world of  
**[0:02:08-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:02:08):**  farming and agriculture was kind of pastoral and quaint and cute and like a great place  
**[0:02:12-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:02:12):**  to grow up as a kid, but not necessarily the kind of important work that I felt as whatever  
**[0:02:18-0:02:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:02:18):**  an arrogant rural kid that I felt like I was going to do in my life.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:02:22):**  So what was important work you wanted to do at that?  
**[0:02:25-0:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:02:25):**  Like work for the state department, I guess.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:02:27):**  I went off to Georgetown to study international affairs and thought like, I'm going to be  
**[0:02:31-0:02:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:02:31):**  a spy or yeah, I don't know.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:02:34):**  Being a spy is a bizarrely common thread among other kids who grew up in Wyoming.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:02:39):**  I don't know if it's like some combination of like patriotism, but also worldliness and  
**[0:02:44-0:02:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:02:44):**  then just physical fitness, I guess.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:02:46):**  I don't genuinely don't understand where it came from, but.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:02:50):**  But there's like a big group of agents that are coming from that region or it's just an  
**[0:02:54-0:02:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:02:54):**  idea that that doesn't happen.  
**[0:02:56-0:02:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:02:56):**  Yeah, not agents, just kids, high school kids who want that.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:02:59):**  That's interesting, but they also end up doing it like a significant percentage or just trying?  
**[0:03:05-0:03:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:03:05):**  No, I would just say they end up like either joining the military, which is a great first  
**[0:03:10-0:03:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:03:10):**  step in terms of headed, being headed in that direction or like going to off to study like  
**[0:03:15-0:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:03:15):**  international affairs, global affairs.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:03:17):**  I live in Washington, D.C. now and there's a surprising amount of former Wyomingites  
**[0:03:21-0:03:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:03:21):**  here who left the state to go abroad and spread democracy.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:03:27):**  I don't know, whatever the things that Americans say are and have ended up, many of them that  
**[0:03:31-0:03:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:03:31):**  I know have ended up doing environmental work at the end of the day.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:03:34):**  But yeah, so I went off to college, started learning about international affairs and basically  
**[0:03:41-0:03:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:03:41):**  got to a point where I was like, wow, agricultural development is such a big part of the international  
**[0:03:44-0:03:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:03:44):**  affairs conversation.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:03:45):**  It was so interesting to me and it was one of the unique things that I could actually  
**[0:03:49-0:03:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:03:49):**  speak to that a lot of my classmates who are interested in it couldn't.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:03:53):**  That, you know, having a background in American agriculture, which is very much driving the  
**[0:03:57-0:03:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:03:57):**  international picture in terms of development.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:03:59):**  And I actually got the chance to go abroad for a year.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:04:01):**  I spent six months in South Africa learning about sustainable ag and then six months in  
**[0:04:06-0:04:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:04:06):**  India actually doing research with an organization that was doing like organic agricultural extension  
**[0:04:13-0:04:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:04:13):**  and learned a lot of really important lessons about development and about being an American  
**[0:04:16-0:04:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:04:16):**  abroad and about like the appropriate role for a white lady in all of these spaces.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:04:22):**  And basically the biggest kind of takeaway I got from that experience was the most impactful  
**[0:04:27-0:04:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:04:27):**  thing I could do for global agriculture, especially in the global South, is to go home and fix  
**[0:04:33-0:04:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:04:33):**  some problems with American agriculture because there are a lot and we export them all the  
**[0:04:38-0:04:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:04:38):**  time and we pretend like exporting our problems is like a gift to other people.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:04:42):**  And they should be happy.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:04:43):**  And yeah, yeah.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:04:44):**  Yes, they should be happy with like our giant John Deere tractors and our like heavily subsidized  
**[0:04:49-0:04:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:04:49):**  kind of industrial style agriculture.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:04:51):**  And so coming back to the place where I could have a big impact here in the US, especially  
**[0:04:55-0:05:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:04:55):**  in agricultural communities where I actually, you know, in agriculture in the United States,  
**[0:05:00-0:05:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:05:00):**  there is a tremendous like gatekeeping going on around like pedigree.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:05:05):**  Like if you didn't grow up on a farm or if you don't have all this experience in agriculture,  
**[0:05:08-0:05:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:05:08):**  then there's the sense that like you can't speak.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:05:10):**  You don't have a say because you don't have the background.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:05:13):**  And one that's like very stupid and a great way to homogenize a group and keep it very  
**[0:05:19-0:05:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:05:19):**  homogenous.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:05:20):**  So being able to like kind of wade back into that and start asking some of the questions  
**[0:05:23-0:05:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:05:23):**  around like, you know, why do we gatekeep this so bad?  
**[0:05:26-0:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:05:26):**  You could because you grew up on a farm.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:05:28):**  So you basically passed the gate without even trying.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:05:30):**  Yeah.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:05:31):**  Bit of a Trojan horse over here.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:05:35):**  But yeah, and just, you know, coming back, starting to ask those questions.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:05:38):**  I actually came back to the US and went straight to Silicon Valley.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:05:42):**  Was super interested in ag tech, saw technology and entrepreneurship is like this really impactful  
**[0:05:46-0:05:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:05:46):**  way to push on agriculture, which is traditionally in the United States, very relationship oriented,  
**[0:05:52-0:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:05:52):**  very conservative, very conventional.  
**[0:05:54-0:05:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:05:54):**  And tech seems like this place where you're speaking in the past.  
**[0:05:57-0:05:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:05:57):**  I'm hearing there's a bad coming, but yeah.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:05:59):**  Oh yeah.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:06:00):**  So, you know, where money and economic opportunity, we're meeting these like environmental goals  
**[0:06:05-0:06:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:06:05):**  and this appetite for change.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:06:08):**  Spent about two years working in ag tech, so much that I loved about it.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:06:12):**  A lot of things that basically were just like, at the end of the day, I saw a lot of ag tech  
**[0:06:16-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:06:16):**  companies bowing under the pressure of just, you know what, like they try and have an environmental  
**[0:06:23-0:06:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:06:23):**  focus.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:06:24):**  They try to do a double or triple bottom line, have double or triple bottom line priorities.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:06:28):**  They try to center communities or address some kind of like justice issue.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:06:32):**  And at the end of the day, there's just not really a market appetite for that.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:06:36):**  And when you accept adventure funding and you need to have some big deliverables, like  
**[0:06:41-0:06:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:06:41):**  you abandon all that stuff and you get farmers to pay you to do stuff.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:06:46):**  And the farmers who have money to pay are the farmers who want you to help them make  
**[0:06:50-0:06:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:06:50):**  more money doing often conventional industrial agriculture.  
**[0:06:54-0:06:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:06:54):**  Or if you can't help them make more money, at least make their job a lot easier or make  
**[0:06:57-0:07:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:06:57):**  it possible for them to farm in even bigger ways.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:07:00):**  So my experience was that in, on the tech side, a lot of companies were diving in with  
**[0:07:05-0:07:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:07:05):**  all these high ideals and then over the course of their relatively short lifespans gave them  
**[0:07:09-0:07:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:07:09):**  all up and just, we're trying to eat the lunch of the big players that were already in agriculture,  
**[0:07:14-0:07:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:07:14):**  which I found kind of frustrating and didn't see it as the motivator of change that I was  
**[0:07:18-0:07:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:07:18):**  looking for.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:07:19):**  So at the end of my time in tech, I was like, well, how do you get paid to just ask the  
**[0:07:24-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:07:24):**  hard questions in agriculture?  
**[0:07:26-0:07:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:07:26):**  Journalism was the answer to that.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:07:28):**  I wish I had looked a little harder about how nobody makes any money in journalism.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:07:33):**  It's kind of your question, like how do you get paid?  
**[0:07:35-0:07:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:07:35):**  Like the payment part wasn't the question, but yeah.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:07:38):**  Yeah.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:07:39):**  So I ended up at RFD TV, which is a national rural like ag rural and ag focused TV network  
**[0:07:46-0:07:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:07:46):**  based in Washington, DC during like right at the beginning of the Trump administration  
**[0:07:50-0:07:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:07:50):**  followed for three years, you know, ag policy from a journalistic perspective, did a daily  
**[0:07:55-0:08:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:07:55):**  story, you know, hundreds and hundreds of daily stories on what was happening in Washington,  
**[0:08:00-0:08:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:08:00):**  which was a phenomenal experience and just being totally disabused of the idea that American  
**[0:08:05-0:08:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:08:05):**  policy could have any impact on agriculture.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:08:08):**  So you went from tech, which isn't of any impact from policy and then where did you  
**[0:08:12-0:08:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:08:12):**  land?  
**[0:08:13-0:08:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:08:13):**  Yeah.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:08:14):**  So I very depressed maybe.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:08:16):**  Yeah.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:08:17):**  Well, I took a hard look, you know, after having some of these realizations and realizing  
**[0:08:21-0:08:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:08:21):**  that these places where we've put kind of our eggs in the basket of like, you know,  
**[0:08:27-0:08:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:08:27):**  if we could just get policy to change, then agriculture will change.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:08:30):**  Or if we could just get tech to change, then agriculture will change.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:08:33):**  Realizing that those were the wrong eggs to put our basket in.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:08:35):**  I went back to the stories that I'd done and thought, you know, who is actually able to  
**[0:08:40-0:08:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:08:40):**  keep the ideas that they came into this with?  
**[0:08:43-0:08:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:08:43):**  And weirdly, right when I started reporting, I met Chris Newman at Sylvan Aqua Farms, did  
**[0:08:48-0:08:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:08:48):**  a story on him.  
**[0:08:50-0:08:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:08:50):**  And three years later, I went back to him.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:08:52):**  And the rule, basically, in like regenerative ag among farmers I knew, especially on the  
**[0:08:57-0:09:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:08:57):**  east coast of the United States, was that like farmers that I met at the beginning of  
**[0:09:01-0:09:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:09:01):**  my time reporting, 90% of them were out of business by the time I was freelancing.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:09:05):**  Three years was a pretty good time for most of them to either have like dramatically changed  
**[0:09:09-0:09:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:09:09):**  the way they do their business, like went from being a business to being a hobby or  
**[0:09:13-0:09:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:09:13):**  just like left farming altogether or had made some other big change that basically like  
**[0:09:18-0:09:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:09:18):**  they couldn't make it work, so they're gone now.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:09:20):**  And Chris Newman somehow was still around and he was thinking about things very differently.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:09:23):**  And he was trying to make some big transitions and had realized some of the same problems  
**[0:09:28-0:09:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:09:28):**  that I had seen.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:09:29):**  And so when I had the freedom to, you know, I was freelancing, I was doing stories in  
**[0:09:34-0:09:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:09:34):**  a very different way than I had when I was full time as a staff journalist.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:09:38):**  I was like, well, I might as well like if I think Chris Newman and Sylvan Aqua Farms  
**[0:09:42-0:09:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:09:42):**  is doing some revolutionary things, and I think that this of all this possible solutions  
**[0:09:47-0:09:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:09:47):**  I've seen, this seems like the most likely to succeed, might as well help.  
**[0:09:51-0:09:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:09:51):**  So came on board there and have been, I work with them almost full time at this point doing  
**[0:09:57-0:10:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:09:57):**  marketing and communications, helping them grow their team, troubleshoot through many  
**[0:10:02-0:10:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:10:02):**  different levels of scale that they're going through kind of all at once, which is nuts,  
**[0:10:06-0:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:10:06):**  but super fun.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:10:07):**  And yeah, I mean, we're really tackling, I think, some of the big questions in agriculture  
**[0:10:12-0:10:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:10:12):**  in fundamentally different ways than a lot of people have ever thought about it.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:10:17):**  And do you think, I mean, compared to all the other farmers you've seen start in those  
**[0:10:21-0:10:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:10:21):**  three years and didn't continue, like are there, of course, the lessons learned, but  
**[0:10:26-0:10:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:10:26):**  what are the key ones that are different with Chris and the team or the ones you've seen  
**[0:10:30-0:10:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:10:30):**  there that really didn't work?  
**[0:10:32-0:10:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:10:32):**  Like what are the big pain points basically you saw there and why many either went to  
**[0:10:36-0:10:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:10:36):**  hobby or just stopped completely or changed completely whatever they were doing?  
**[0:10:39-0:10:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:10:39):**  Yeah.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:10:40):**  So there's two big, especially among young regenerative, like people who come into the  
**[0:10:47-0:10:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:10:47):**  work for the passion of farming or for like environmental justice reasons or for like  
**[0:10:52-0:10:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:10:52):**  racial justice reasons.  
**[0:10:54-0:10:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:10:54):**  If you don't own land, it's not going to work.  
**[0:10:56-0:10:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:10:56):**  The fundamental part of this conversation that like no one ever really wants to talk  
**[0:10:59-0:11:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:10:59):**  about is that fewer than 2 million Americans own $3 trillion worth of farmland in the United  
**[0:11:04-0:11:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:11:04):**  States.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:11:05):**  And that's just like, you know, we talk a lot about the price of food and how the price  
**[0:11:09-0:11:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:11:09):**  of food should be higher, especially when it's high quality food, like that which was  
**[0:11:12-0:11:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:11:12):**  grown with sustainable or regenerative practices.  
**[0:11:14-0:11:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:11:14):**  But the reality is like the price only goes so high when there's a really low price alternative  
**[0:11:19-0:11:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:11:19):**  around.  
**[0:11:20-0:11:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:11:20):**  So people, you know, no matter how good we see this in other spaces, too, right?  
**[0:11:24-0:11:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:11:24):**  Like no matter how good your super fancy like distilled alcohol is or your super fancy restaurant  
**[0:11:31-0:11:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:11:31):**  is like, you can have a French laundry and people will pay $250 to eat your tasting menu,  
**[0:11:36-0:11:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:11:36):**  but they can't do that every day.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:11:37):**  There's like a limit to how much people can possibly spend on really high priced stuff.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:11:42):**  So how farmers make money when they can't charge enough to make a living is their farmland  
**[0:11:49-0:11:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:11:49):**  value appreciates over time.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:11:51):**  It's a store of wealth and that like growth and wealth makes it possible to like keep  
**[0:11:55-0:11:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:11:55):**  to stay in business to cover the cost of property taxes, which are also insanely low for agricultural  
**[0:11:59-0:12:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:11:59):**  land in the United States.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:12:01):**  And just like, yeah, even if you are breaking even every year, as long as your property  
**[0:12:05-0:12:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:12:05):**  value grows, which it always does, like land values almost never drop in the United States.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:12:10):**  And they've beaten the S&P 500, as a matter of fact, as an investment class for most of  
**[0:12:14-0:12:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:12:14):**  the last 50 years.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:12:15):**  Yeah.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:12:16):**  So like, as long as you have that, that's fine and on the other hand, if you don't have  
**[0:12:20-0:12:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:12:20):**  that and you have to rent farmland and you're farming it regeneratively, that means your  
**[0:12:26-0:12:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:12:26):**  landlord is actually charging you twice because you are both paying a competitive land rent,  
**[0:12:33-0:12:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:12:33):**  which you're competing against conventional agriculture, which is extracting the resources.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:12:37):**  And we know that regenerative agriculture is more costly in terms of, right, we're internalizing  
**[0:12:42-0:12:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:12:42):**  the costs that conventional agriculture externalizes.  
**[0:12:45-0:12:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:12:45):**  So basically like, you know, when I'm a small farmer, if I was like 32 years old and I got  
**[0:12:50-0:12:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:12:50):**  into Virginia and I rent 10 acres and I sell at the local farmers market, I have to charge  
**[0:12:55-0:13:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:12:55):**  a price that pays for my land rent and for the cost of my regenerative practices, which  
**[0:13:00-0:13:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:13:00):**  means I have to raise my price and ask my customers to carry the weight of double rent.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:13:04):**  And for the subsidies you're not getting, which is a missed opportunity cost and for  
**[0:13:08-0:13:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:13:08):**  many other things.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:13:09):**  Yeah.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:13:10):**  Yep.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:13:11):**  And if I can't do that, if my customers won't pay that price, then I just have to stomach  
**[0:13:13-0:13:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:13:13):**  it, which means basically like nobody in regenerative ag is paying themselves a living wage.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:13:19):**  No one is paying workers a living wage.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:13:21):**  And eventually that just like crushes you.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:13:23):**  You can only lose money for so long before you realize like, Hey, I have a college degree.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:13:27):**  I'm just going to go get a job.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:13:28):**  This is called a hobby.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:13:29):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:13:30):**  Maybe I can keep farming on the weekends or maybe I can do something or maybe my partner  
**[0:13:34-0:13:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:13:34):**  can get a job that can support us both and the farm.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:13:38):**  But eventually I know, you know, probably less than 5% of small young regenerative farmers  
**[0:13:44-0:13:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:13:44):**  that have gotten started in the last like 10 years that I know are still farming.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:13:48):**  You just can't, it just, the economics don't work.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:13:50):**  Of the land.  
**[0:13:51-0:13:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:13:51):**  So the land ownership, the smallness probably is a big piece of that.  
**[0:13:55-0:13:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:13:55):**  So you said there are two things, so land ownership and what was the second?  
**[0:13:58-0:14:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:13:58):**  So the other thing is that is the labor challenge, which is tied directly into the cost of farmland,  
**[0:14:02-0:14:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:14:02):**  which is we just pretend like it's not there most of the time in regenerative ag is like,  
**[0:14:07-0:14:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:14:07):**  because we expect that farmers are getting like a lifestyle bonus.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:14:10):**  They just should be so chuffed to be out because they always have the view and they are outside.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:14:17):**  Yeah.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:14:18):**  It's beautiful and that's what people want and that should be enough.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:14:20):**  Well guess what?  
**[0:14:21-0:14:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:14:21):**  Verizon wireless does not accept a lifestyle check for your cell phone bill, but you need  
**[0:14:26-0:14:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:14:26):**  a cell phone bill even just to operate your business.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:14:29):**  The problem is that we have built in this idea and we do it in other ways in regenerative  
**[0:14:33-0:14:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:14:33):**  ag.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:14:34):**  It's a business.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:14:35):**  It's interesting.  
**[0:14:36-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:14:36):**  It's a business, which a lot of people won't, but it's absolutely crucial to call it a business.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:14:40):**  Like this is an agriculture business and we haven't been operating it as a business because  
**[0:14:45-0:14:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:14:45):**  it would be bankrupt a long time ago.  
**[0:14:47-0:14:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:14:47):**  Exactly.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:14:48):**  And that labor question, you know, there's lots of ways we get around paying for labor,  
**[0:14:51-0:14:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:14:51):**  especially in regenerative.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:14:52):**  We do like lean really heavily on volunteers, which is not things that businesses do.  
**[0:14:56-0:14:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:14:56):**  You should not have to donate to a for-profit business.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:14:59):**  That's just not how that works.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:15:01):**  We also do like, right, you do a lot of farm apprenticeship programs and things like that,  
**[0:15:05-0:15:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:15:05):**  where people get paid like a hundred dollars a month to work 12 hours a day in exchange  
**[0:15:10-0:15:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:15:10):**  for education.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:15:11):**  There's no one regulating what it means to be like educated in regenerative ag.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:15:15):**  But you know, those, the problem of not paying for labor in agriculture is the American agriculture  
**[0:15:21-0:15:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:15:21):**  history.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:15:22):**  Like the whole thing is just like farmers don't pay for labor.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:15:25):**  So it's certainly not regenerative ag's problem alone, but it's not a problem that I think  
**[0:15:30-0:15:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:15:30):**  most regenerative farmers have taken on and tried to solve in any serious way.  
**[0:15:35-0:15:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:15:35):**  And they have to, if you want to grow this movement and take on conventional extractive  
**[0:15:40-0:15:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:15:40):**  input-based ag.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:15:41):**  Because they don't need to make money in the normal way, in a sense of selling food because  
**[0:15:45-0:15:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:15:45):**  they're not.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:15:46):**  And they just need to keep, as long as they don't go bankrupt and they keep the land,  
**[0:15:51-0:15:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:15:51):**  they are fine because it keeps going up in price.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:15:53):**  And that's the only thing they do.  
**[0:15:55-0:15:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:15:55):**  And as long as they keep their head above the water, they're okay.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:15:58):**  But not high enough to actually pay themselves.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:16:00):**  And that's the difficult standard.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:16:01):**  Yeah.  
**[0:16:02-0:16:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:16:02):**  Well, and it's, and there's this really odd thing, this really odd mindset in American  
**[0:16:06-0:16:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:16:06):**  ag that coming from tech was hard to put my finger on at first, but once you see it, it's  
**[0:16:12-0:16:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:16:12):**  hard to not see it.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:16:13):**  And I summed it up.  
**[0:16:14-0:16:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:16:14):**  A farmer I talked to recently who farms outside of LA and farms, you know, does value added  
**[0:16:19-0:16:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:16:19):**  food products that he sells at farmers markets.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:16:21):**  His whole vision of like his life and like why things have gone well for him are basically  
**[0:16:27-0:16:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:16:27):**  like motto is I can't afford $15 an hour salespeople.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:16:31):**  And I can't not afford $25 an hour salespeople.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:16:34):**  And it's like, yes, this is a thing we've forgotten in agriculture that when you pay  
**[0:16:38-0:16:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:16:38):**  people, you get better people.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:16:41):**  Like there's this idea that like all farm labor is the same and that it's all like  
**[0:16:47-0:16:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:16:47):**  valueless basically that you just like have to get bodies to do the work for you.  
**[0:16:52-0:16:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:16:52):**  Hands.  
**[0:16:53-0:16:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:16:53):**  Yeah.  
**[0:16:54-0:16:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:16:54):**  Basically hands.  
**[0:16:55-0:16:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:16:55):**  Yeah.  
**[0:16:56-0:16:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:16:56):**  Yeah.  
**[0:16:57-0:16:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:16:57):**  That's the.  
**[0:16:58-0:16:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:16:58):**  Exactly.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:16:59):**  A robot's fine.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:17:00):**  Free labor's fine.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:17:01):**  Right.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:17:02):**  The whole idea that like you can run your business with volunteers is insane if you  
**[0:17:04-0:17:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:17:04):**  think that your business is about value at all, because value, like everyone should not  
**[0:17:09-0:17:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:17:09):**  be able to add the same amount of value in your business.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:17:12):**  You should be adding specific value.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:17:14):**  And so definitely we'll link the interview with Chris below, obviously in the show notes.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:17:20):**  You and I'm taking you plural here, taking a very different approach that we've touched  
**[0:17:24-0:17:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:17:24):**  upon it with Chris, but I would love to, for anybody that didn't listen, like what's because  
**[0:17:28-0:17:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:17:28):**  this is a massive.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:17:30):**  Undertaken and also basically challenging all the things we thought about.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:17:34):**  Okay.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:17:35):**  What is a farm?  
**[0:17:36-0:17:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:17:36):**  What is a farming family?  
**[0:17:37-0:17:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:17:37):**  What is a farming operation or company actually looks like and basically deconstructing it  
**[0:17:41-0:17:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:17:41):**  and designing it from the ground up again.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:17:44):**  So can you walk us through what it actually looks like ideally?  
**[0:17:46-0:17:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:17:46):**  And then let's talk about what it looks like now, but ideally how would we get around a  
**[0:17:50-0:17:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:17:50):**  lot of these or these two main issues like labor or work in general and land ownership?  
**[0:17:55-0:17:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:17:55):**  Sure.  
**[0:17:56-0:18:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:17:56):**  So in the most ideal sense, it basically, those two problems are solutions to each other.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:18:02):**  If you don't have money, if you don't have revenue to pay workers, which is common in  
**[0:18:06-0:18:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:18:06):**  agriculture and makes sense, then how would an entrepreneur use what they do have, which  
**[0:18:11-0:18:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:18:11):**  is an appreciating asset to compensate people that they need to do their business with ownership?  
**[0:18:18-0:18:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:18:18):**  Like that's how you do it.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:18:20):**  Startups do this.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:18:21):**  Like this is nothing that agriculture will be like blazing a brand new trail and figuring  
**[0:18:25-0:18:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:18:25):**  it out all on their own.  
**[0:18:26-0:18:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:18:26):**  Right?  
**[0:18:27-0:18:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:18:27):**  We have like decades and decades of in America, you only have to be 10% employee owned to  
**[0:18:30-0:18:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:18:30):**  be technically employee owned, which means all startups are employee owned, which I think  
**[0:18:35-0:18:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:18:35):**  for a lot of people you hear employee owned farms or communal farms and people are immediately  
**[0:18:38-0:18:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:18:38):**  like, Oh, it won't work.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:18:39):**  It's socialism.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:18:40):**  It's there's all these examples in history where it's broken and it's failing.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:18:44):**  And it's like, no employee owned businesses are quite successful the world over.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:18:47):**  There's lots of good examples of employee owned businesses.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:18:50):**  Employment owns could mean very different things like different levels, et cetera.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:18:53):**  But it comes down to the essence of, I don't have a lot of cash on hand because I'm building  
**[0:18:58-0:19:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:18:58):**  soil or building businesses, et cetera.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:19:00):**  But I can pay you if you believe what we're doing here.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:19:03):**  Apart from that, I pay something obviously because you have to eat and pay your Verizon  
**[0:19:06-0:19:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:19:06):**  bills.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:19:07):**  But I also, you grow in wealth because of ownership.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:19:10):**  Exactly.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:19:11):**  And that's how, you know, when I talk to farmers about you need to hire better people, you  
**[0:19:15-0:19:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:19:15):**  know, one of the big things that I hear when I talk to new farmers who are starting out  
**[0:19:19-0:19:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:19:19):**  or farmers who are at a place where they're trying to get to that they're in basically  
**[0:19:22-0:19:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:19:22):**  like, right.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:19:23):**  This is common in other kinds of entrepreneurship.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:19:24):**  There's like a valley of doom where you're, you go from being small to being midsize and  
**[0:19:29-0:19:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:19:29):**  in between those is a really hard scaling period that a lot of companies don't make  
**[0:19:32-0:19:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:19:32):**  it through.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:19:33):**  And they get to that upper level of small and they say, you know, I have all this stuff.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:19:37):**  My business is running me ragged, but I don't feel like I can afford employees.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:19:41):**  And the answer to that is always like, if you need employees, figure it out, like dig  
**[0:19:45-0:19:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:19:45):**  deep and find.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:19:46):**  And again, this equity question is right there and I think people don't want to access it.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:19:51):**  And the number one reason why, when I tell farmers, like, have you considered offering  
**[0:19:54-0:19:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:19:54):**  like an ownership path for your employees?  
**[0:19:57-0:20:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:19:57):**  Farmers say, well, how am I going to pass it on to my kids if I let my employees be  
**[0:20:01-0:20:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:20:01):**  owners?  
**[0:20:02-0:20:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:20:02):**  If they want to be employees, they can, otherwise they can't.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:20:04):**  Yes.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:20:05):**  But nobody ever says that if they are a tech entrepreneur, like, how am I going to pass  
**[0:20:08-0:20:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:20:08):**  this on to my kids?  
**[0:20:09-0:20:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:20:09):**  Like, what are you talking about?  
**[0:20:10-0:20:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:20:10):**  Yeah.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:20:11):**  Could you imagine Larry Page being like, well, I'd love to have good engineers, but I really  
**[0:20:14-0:20:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:20:14):**  want Google to be passed on to my children.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:20:16):**  So like, how could I possibly?  
**[0:20:18-0:20:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:20:18):**  I hope they're good at coding.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:20:20):**  They really do.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:20:21):**  Yeah.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:20:22):**  I'm sure they are because they've just been hanging around me for a while.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:20:25):**  So I'm sure they'll be great.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:20:26):**  They'll be great.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:20:27):**  But do you know when, I have no idea if this is a relevant question, but when that sort  
**[0:20:31-0:20:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:20:31):**  of concept started in tech, like that wasn't something natural, was there a period where  
**[0:20:35-0:20:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:20:35):**  they didn't do it and they got to the limit of that smallness and then said, okay, we  
**[0:20:39-0:20:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:20:39):**  just don't have the cash to pay, but we have ownership of something that might be extremely  
**[0:20:43-0:20:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:20:43):**  successful in the future.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:20:44):**  So let's offer that.  
**[0:20:45-0:20:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:20:45):**  Was there a moment somebody that came up with this idea or was it a gradual thing?  
**[0:20:50-0:20:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:20:50):**  Do you know at all?  
**[0:20:51-0:20:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:20:51):**  I am not the tech historian that would know the answer to that question.  
**[0:20:54-0:20:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:20:54):**  But I actually think, I mean, from my experience with tech companies, it starts long before  
**[0:20:59-0:21:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:20:59):**  like a small business running out of money, right?  
**[0:21:01-0:21:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:21:01):**  Because most tech startups don't start out as small businesses.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:21:04):**  They're never like family owned.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:21:05):**  They're just, you are like a founder with a founding team maybe, and you're just going  
**[0:21:09-0:21:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:21:09):**  to investors and trying to raise money.  
**[0:21:11-0:21:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:21:11):**  And what you're selling to these investors is like a stake in your business, which means  
**[0:21:14-0:21:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:21:14):**  you have to have the business ownership divided up already.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:21:17):**  So it's easy to do it.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:21:19):**  Yeah.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:21:20):**  Yeah.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:21:21):**  There's not a perfect comparison there for sure.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:21:22):**  But yeah, this, the whole idea of employee ownership in agriculture and using farmland  
**[0:21:27-0:21:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:21:27):**  assets and other capital assets as a way to pay, to compensate employees necessitates  
**[0:21:32-0:21:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:21:32):**  a deep interrogation of, are you farming as an investment so that your kids can inherit  
**[0:21:39-0:21:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:21:39):**  it?  
**[0:21:40-0:21:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:21:40):**  You're not worried about inheritance.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:21:41):**  You're worried about your investment.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:21:43):**  You're not worried about your business in that moment.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:21:46):**  So is this a business or is this an investment?  
**[0:21:48-0:21:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:21:48):**  I think that's an important question.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:21:49):**  And I think honestly, American agriculture would be operating entirely differently if  
**[0:21:54-0:21:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:21:54):**  it was treated primarily as a business and not primarily as an investment class.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:21:59):**  But you know, I think if we're, especially when we're talking about regenerative ag,  
**[0:22:02-0:22:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:22:02):**  when we're talking about changing diets, when we're talking about being more environmentally  
**[0:22:06-0:22:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:22:06):**  resilient, we have to be talking about farming the business, not farming the investment class.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:22:11):**  Because farming the investment class, there's just nothing.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:22:13):**  There's nothing you can do because it's just like maximum extraction, right?  
**[0:22:16-0:22:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:22:16):**  That's what an investment is, is how do I get the most cash?  
**[0:22:19-0:22:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:22:19):**  How do I optimize between long-term, long run gain and cash today?  
**[0:22:25-0:22:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:22:25):**  Soil doesn't factor into that conversation.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:22:27):**  It like can't really.  
**[0:22:28-0:22:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:22:28):**  So if we're talking about farming as a business, then yeah, if your kid wants to become an  
**[0:22:35-0:22:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:22:35):**  employee and work their way into ownership, like other employees have a chance to, then  
**[0:22:38-0:22:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:22:38):**  great.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:22:39):**  And then you can pass that down.  
**[0:22:40-0:22:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:22:40):**  I mean, other that's not uncommon in other parts of the economy too.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:22:43):**  Law is a good example.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:22:44):**  Like, you know, if your dad was a partner at a law firm, you'll probably get a job there.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:22:48):**  You'll probably get a chance to be a partner, but are you the only person who will ever  
**[0:22:52-0:22:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:22:52):**  get a chance to be a partner?  
**[0:22:53-0:22:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:22:53):**  No.  
**[0:22:54-0:22:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:22:54):**  Architects are saying, yeah, it's very, I mean, you get a huge leg up obviously, but  
**[0:22:59-0:23:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:22:59):**  you still have to work.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:23:00):**  That's the, the, and you have to prove.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:23:02):**  Well, and the law firm will probably die if like no other one is considered except for  
**[0:23:06-0:23:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:23:06):**  you.  
**[0:23:07-0:23:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:23:07):**  And so how would that work in, because we not took hypothetical, how would it work in,  
**[0:23:11-0:23:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:23:11):**  I would say practice or how would it work in this example?  
**[0:23:14-0:23:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:23:14):**  Like what's needed to get that done?  
**[0:23:15-0:23:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:23:15):**  Obviously you get when you share that with farming friends that the first, I mean, the  
**[0:23:21-0:23:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:23:21):**  student as they respond saying, what do I give to my kids?  
**[0:23:24-0:23:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:23:24):**  That means they look at it as an investment or there's a business, but let's say to say,  
**[0:23:27-0:23:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:23:27):**  oh, that's very interesting.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:23:28):**  What should I do?  
**[0:23:29-0:23:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:23:29):**  What would be your answer?  
**[0:23:30-0:23:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:23:30):**  Yeah.  
**[0:23:31-0:23:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:23:31):**  That's a tough question because I think it looks kind of different for every person because  
**[0:23:36-0:23:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:23:36):**  I'll talk about Sylvan Aqua first.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:23:38):**  Sylvan Aqua doesn't own any farmland, so there's not big capital assets that you can say, you  
**[0:23:43-0:23:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:23:43):**  know, here's, you know, our net worth.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:23:45):**  Is it in the plan to own it at some point or not?  
**[0:23:48-0:23:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:23:48):**  Sylvan Aqua is like kind of a complex and unique situation where there's like going  
**[0:23:52-0:23:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:23:52):**  to be an Atlanta trust and wealth created that way.  
**[0:23:55-0:24:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:23:55):**  I would say also there's like a mission focus that doesn't necessarily for me, I am more  
**[0:24:02-0:24:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:24:02):**  interested in making a model that's kind of flexible and that different people can accommodate  
**[0:24:08-0:24:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:24:08):**  to their different situations.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:24:09):**  Cause like I hear it and we actually were just talking about this yesterday.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:24:12):**  The idea that like if I, I own 500 acres and I don't want to farm it by myself and I don't  
**[0:24:19-0:24:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:24:19):**  want to run because this is the fundamental problem for a lot of small holding farmers,  
**[0:24:23-0:24:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:24:23):**  right?  
**[0:24:24-0:24:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:24:24):**  If you want to be the agronomist and the hydrologist and the accountant and the like investor relations  
**[0:24:29-0:24:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:24:29):**  person and the marketer and the, then you, all of that falls to you.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:24:33):**  You're a small business owner and you have to do all that stuff or you have to hire someone  
**[0:24:36-0:24:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:24:36):**  to do it for you.  
**[0:24:37-0:24:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:24:37):**  And if you don't have money to hire people, then you need to have partners that help you  
**[0:24:40-0:24:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:24:40):**  do it.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:24:42):**  And that does not mean like you have to find someone and then like give them half of your  
**[0:24:47-0:24:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:24:47):**  business.  
**[0:24:48-0:24:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:24:48):**  That's not the only way to do it.  
**[0:24:49-0:24:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:24:49):**  And like you can write how startups do it is you offer shares and then people still  
**[0:24:53-0:24:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:24:53):**  buy in.  
**[0:24:54-0:24:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:24:54):**  It's at usually, you know, a relatively low rate and they, when it's startups, it's also  
**[0:24:59-0:25:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:24:59):**  a relatively small amount of the company that is available to them.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:25:02):**  But you know, I think it takes a level of sophistication, financial sophistication,  
**[0:25:07-0:25:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:25:07):**  basically that.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:25:08):**  And business sophistication.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:25:09):**  For sure.  
**[0:25:10-0:25:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:25:10):**  Which all of farming should require a certain level of business sophistication that it largely  
**[0:25:14-0:25:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:25:14):**  does not in the United States a lot of the time.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:25:17):**  But yeah, you know, I think in a lot of ways that's still being figured out in other people's  
**[0:25:21-0:25:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:25:21):**  operations.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:25:22):**  You know, we've been in communication with a lot of folks who are interested in this.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:25:25):**  I think it's hard.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:25:27):**  One of the other really challenging things in this space compared to say tech is it's  
**[0:25:32-0:25:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:25:32):**  really easy to split up someone else's money between you and your partners.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:25:36):**  It's much harder to say like, this is all my capital that I brought into this relationship  
**[0:25:40-0:25:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:25:40):**  and I'm going to meet it out to other people.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:25:43):**  And I think because in the US there's basically no differentiation between farm wealth and  
**[0:25:50-0:25:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:25:50):**  family wealth.  
**[0:25:51-0:25:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:25:51):**  Those are interchangeable, which is problematic, right?  
**[0:25:54-0:25:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:25:54):**  Other businesses that is not true.  
**[0:25:56-0:25:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:25:56):**  There's like a clear distinction between.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:25:58):**  It becomes problematic in family companies as soon as it's pretty much the same thing.  
**[0:26:03-0:26:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:26:03):**  And then, you know, it's a recipe for disaster.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:26:05):**  Yes, for sure.  
**[0:26:06-0:26:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:26:06):**  I think this is a point that I am like always trying to make, which is just like we exceptionalize  
**[0:26:10-0:26:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:26:10):**  agriculture in a lot of ways and basically every way possible.  
**[0:26:15-0:26:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:26:15):**  But the reality is it's not significantly different from most other family businesses  
**[0:26:19-0:26:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:26:19):**  and its problems and its challenges and its benefits in the ways that it is regulated  
**[0:26:25-0:26:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:26:25):**  and unregulated.  
**[0:26:26-0:26:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:26:26):**  And so I think in a lot of conversations I've had with people about, you know, like, why  
**[0:26:31-0:26:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:26:31):**  don't you consider equity?  
**[0:26:32-0:26:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:26:32):**  Why don't you consider like buying your employees into your business?  
**[0:26:34-0:26:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:26:34):**  There's a lot of like, oh, well, that maybe that works in other businesses, but not in  
**[0:26:37-0:26:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:26:37):**  agriculture.  
**[0:26:38-0:26:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:26:38):**  The answer to that is just always like, yes, it does work in agriculture.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:26:41):**  Like there's no reason it wouldn't work in agriculture.  
**[0:26:44-0:26:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:26:44):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:26:45):**  It's a bit of the same discussion of many farmers like, oh, but yeah, he or she is doing,  
**[0:26:48-0:26:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:26:48):**  I don't know, holistic grazing or completely different ways of farming that would never  
**[0:26:53-0:26:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:26:53):**  work here because it's a different climate.  
**[0:26:55-0:26:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:26:55):**  No, it's not like it's a neighbor.  
**[0:26:57-0:27:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:26:57):**  Like if it works on the other side of the fence, it also works for you.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:27:00):**  If you want to, if you want to explore, you could do differently, et cetera.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:27:02):**  But it doesn't mean like it's not unique.  
**[0:27:04-0:27:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:27:04):**  It's very difficult to find a unique situation.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:27:06):**  Exactly.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:27:07):**  And there's so much pushback around like, well, you know, this has been in my family  
**[0:27:11-0:27:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:27:11):**  all this time.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:27:12):**  This is my heritage.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:27:13):**  This is my legacy.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:27:14):**  Everyone's family business is their legacy.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:27:16):**  Everyone's family business is their heritage.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:27:17):**  And I know many people that sold it.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:27:19):**  Yeah.  
**[0:27:20-0:27:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:27:20):**  Yeah.  
**[0:27:21-0:27:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:27:21):**  And like, guess what?  
**[0:27:22-0:27:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:27:22):**  If we were still paying all the cobblers in America, all the descendants of cobblers just  
**[0:27:25-0:27:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:27:25):**  to cobble because like their parents and grandparents did it.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:27:28):**  And like, that's the thing that we like believe they should do.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:27:30):**  We would be in a very weird situation.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:27:32):**  So let's like walk away from all the arguments about like legacy and heritage.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:27:36):**  And remember that like, yes, absolutely.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:27:39):**  You inherited it and it's yours and that's fine.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:27:42):**  And it's a business and you should operate it like one.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:27:44):**  And if you are incapable of doing that, then we should be talking about like what comes  
**[0:27:49-0:27:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:27:49):**  next because we don't just support people doing what they want to do because, because.  
**[0:27:56-0:28:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:27:56):**  And it is a different sector for at least the environmental destruction and the environmental  
**[0:28:02-0:28:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:28:02):**  opportunity.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:28:03):**  Like it's so big in terms of simple acreage, et cetera.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:28:07):**  Like it does affect all of us.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:28:08):**  Like if you run your bicycle shop or a bicycle company in an amazing way, it does affect  
**[0:28:13-0:28:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:28:13):**  all of us as well.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:28:14):**  But if you run your large, large farm estate in a very destructive way, it affects everyone  
**[0:28:19-0:28:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:28:19):**  around you.  
**[0:28:20-0:28:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:28:20):**  Plus everybody far away because of climate change, et cetera.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:28:22):**  So it is all of our problem quite dramatically.  
**[0:28:24-0:28:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:28:24):**  And you kind of say it is my land, so I do whatever I want, which currently is because  
**[0:28:29-0:28:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:28:29):**  it does affect.  
**[0:28:30-0:28:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:28:30):**  And at some point we'll come like at some point there will be enough regulation to push  
**[0:28:32-0:28:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:28:32):**  you and it's not going to stop at the gate.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:28:34):**  Like you kind of keep this out.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:28:36):**  It's sort of, sort of all of our problem.  
**[0:28:38-0:28:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:28:38):**  Yeah.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:28:39):**  And which is all such good points and why it's so frustrating to see the absolute lack  
**[0:28:44-0:28:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:28:44):**  of environmental regulation on American farms because it's OK, the environmental working  
**[0:28:48-0:28:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:28:48):**  group can basically show point source like nitrogen runoff, a phosphorus runoff from  
**[0:28:54-0:28:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:28:54):**  farms directly.  
**[0:28:55-0:28:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:28:55):**  So even the argument that like we can't tell which farm it came from, so how could we possibly  
**[0:28:59-0:29:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:28:59):**  regulate them is there's nothing left.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:29:01):**  We know we know that the like the hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico is directly due essentially  
**[0:29:05-0:29:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:29:05):**  to just farmers in Iowa.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:29:07):**  There's no questions left.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:29:09):**  And the idea that we taxpayers pay north have been paying more than five billion dollars  
**[0:29:15-0:29:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:29:15):**  directly to private farms for the last twenty five years.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:29:19):**  Well this problem has gotten worse and worse.  
**[0:29:22-0:29:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:29:22):**  And somehow the conversation at the end of that reality is how can we pay farmers to  
**[0:29:27-0:29:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:29:27):**  do better?  
**[0:29:28-0:29:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:29:28):**  We already paid.  
**[0:29:30-0:29:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:29:30):**  We've been paying all this time and we didn't get the result we wanted.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:29:35):**  As a matter of fact, the Gulf hypoxia task force met in 2007 and made the goal to reduce  
**[0:29:39-0:29:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:29:39):**  runoff to the Gulf by 50 percent by 2015.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:29:42):**  In 2015, they reevaluated and found that they had actually increased runoff by 20 percent.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:29:48):**  So they're actively moving in the wrong direction.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:29:51):**  Payments directly to farmers have gone up over that time period, resulting in forty  
**[0:29:54-0:29:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:29:54):**  six billion dollars in direct payments last year that overwhelmingly went to the top like  
**[0:29:57-0:30:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:29:57):**  one percent of farmers, which for me is a very discouraging part of this whole conversation  
**[0:30:02-0:30:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:30:02):**  about like, you know, how can companies get in on paying farmers to do more regenerative  
**[0:30:07-0:30:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:30:07):**  practices?  
**[0:30:08-0:30:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:30:08):**  Sorry, we've already paid.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:30:10):**  We've already like sunk a lot of money into these farms.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:30:14):**  Like taxpayers at this point, it's hard to say how they are not the number one investors.  
**[0:30:20-0:30:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:30:20):**  Investors in businesses get a say.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:30:23):**  They get to tell you how to do your job by definition.  
**[0:30:26-0:30:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:30:26):**  Like when you're an entrepreneur and you've taken investment money, you have a boss now.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:30:30):**  You're investors.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:30:32):**  And that is just like never part of this conversation.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:30:36):**  It's always about how farmers are in a bad situation and how they don't have the resources  
**[0:30:40-0:30:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:30:40):**  they need to do better.  
**[0:30:41-0:30:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:30:41):**  And that is just not true.  
**[0:30:43-0:30:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:30:43):**  And that's, I think, a very frustrating part of this whole thing.  
**[0:30:46-0:30:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:30:46):**  And it comes from this idea of like, right, that these are farm families and they're just  
**[0:30:51-0:30:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:30:51):**  individuals like trying to do what's best for their land and trying to perpetuate their  
**[0:30:54-0:30:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:30:54):**  legacy.  
**[0:30:55-0:30:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:30:55):**  But the reality is farms are businesses, which is OK.  
**[0:30:58-0:31:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:30:58):**  It's fine for farms to be businesses.  
**[0:31:00-0:31:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:31:00):**  That's always what they've been.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:31:01):**  But let's treat them as businesses.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:31:03):**  Exactly.  
**[0:31:04-0:31:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:31:04):**  We have to treat them as businesses.  
**[0:31:06-0:31:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:31:06):**  Putting family in front of the word farm does not mean that it's not profit seeking.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:31:11):**  It has to be profit seeking.  
**[0:31:13-0:31:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:31:13):**  But they're so cute on the pictures of the products I buy.  
**[0:31:16-0:31:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:31:16):**  I mean, it's fascinating.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:31:18):**  You put a link the article below.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:31:21):**  You pick the fight with the carbon credit people.  
**[0:31:23-0:31:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:31:23):**  I think you got a lot of response to that recently.  
**[0:31:25-0:31:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:31:25):**  Let's see when this interview comes out.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:31:27):**  But it's for sure you pick the fight with somebody else before that.  
**[0:31:30-0:31:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:31:30):**  But the image of the struggling American and I think we can actually take that to many  
**[0:31:36-0:31:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:31:36):**  other continents, a family farm that is really we should really pity.  
**[0:31:40-0:31:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:31:40):**  And the truth is and if you look here in Europe on the direct payments go to the top one or  
**[0:31:45-0:31:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:31:45):**  two percent of the farmers that absolutely don't need it and are by far the most destructive  
**[0:31:49-0:31:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:31:49):**  farmers we can possibly find and are really not the people you want to pay.  
**[0:31:54-0:31:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:31:54):**  And we're not getting results, by the way, for paying.  
**[0:31:57-0:31:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:31:57):**  And yeah, it's a mind boggling.  
**[0:31:58-0:32:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:31:58):**  And it grew out of sort of I wouldn't say necessity, but it didn't nobody designed the  
**[0:32:02-0:32:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:32:02):**  system to do that.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:32:03):**  But it's somehow over the last 30, 40, 50 years, depending where you start, it grew  
**[0:32:07-0:32:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:32:07):**  that way.  
**[0:32:08-0:32:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:32:08):**  And we completely distorted anything.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:32:09):**  And you get paid for plowing and you get paid for many other things that let's say are not  
**[0:32:14-0:32:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:32:14):**  growing food, definitely not nutrient dense, but not even food in general.  
**[0:32:18-0:32:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:32:18):**  And that's it's pretty disordered.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:32:20):**  But it's interesting.  
**[0:32:21-0:32:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:32:21):**  Like, this is a depressing picture.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:32:23):**  But do you see is something changing?  
**[0:32:25-0:32:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:32:25):**  Is something are we getting to a breaking point of all of this or are we going to see  
**[0:32:29-0:32:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:32:29):**  that in our lifetime?  
**[0:32:30-0:32:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:32:30):**  What do you think?  
**[0:32:31-0:32:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:32:31):**  I can only speak to the US.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:32:32):**  I'm very hyper focused, for better or worse.  
**[0:32:35-0:32:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:32:35):**  But I think between the massive amount of payments that farmers got during the Trump  
**[0:32:38-0:32:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:32:38):**  administration north of 100 billion dollars in direct payments and the fact that we just  
**[0:32:43-0:32:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:32:43):**  spent 13 months and will likely spend six or eight or 10 more months being in this pandemic,  
**[0:32:49-0:32:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:32:49):**  which has impoverished people, left tens of millions of Americans hungry.  
**[0:32:53-0:32:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:32:53):**  And we completely botched any food aid.  
**[0:32:56-0:33:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:32:56):**  We continue the most recent coronavirus aid bill that's going through Congress has more  
**[0:33:00-0:33:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:33:00):**  payments for farmers, more flexibility for them.  
**[0:33:03-0:33:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:33:03):**  We know that paying farmers does not contribute to food security.  
**[0:33:07-0:33:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:33:07):**  We know that farm prices are way up.  
**[0:33:10-0:33:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:33:10):**  International commodity prices are at 10 year highs right now and they're still going to  
**[0:33:14-0:33:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:33:14):**  get more payments.  
**[0:33:15-0:33:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:33:15):**  I think what happened in America's meat packing plants, unfortunately, since literally the  
**[0:33:21-0:33:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:33:21):**  jungle was written 100 years ago, we've never cared about meatpacking workers.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:33:27):**  We only care about food safety.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:33:28):**  But that's a whole nother question.  
**[0:33:30-0:33:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:33:30):**  And it's absolutely in the United States about racism and where we think that that like the  
**[0:33:34-0:33:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:33:34):**  right place for immigrants is.  
**[0:33:36-0:33:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:33:36):**  But I think that there is a opportunity in this moment to say, you know, yeah, for people  
**[0:33:43-0:33:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:33:43):**  to say like, hey, I'm done paying farmers.  
**[0:33:45-0:33:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:33:45):**  They're not doing the right thing.  
**[0:33:46-0:33:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:33:46):**  You know, I think the farmer I talked about in that article, what is getting paid for  
**[0:33:50-0:33:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:33:50):**  planting cover crops?  
**[0:33:53-0:33:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:33:53):**  Cover crops is not enough.  
**[0:33:54-0:33:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:33:54):**  First of all, you can already get paid for it in the state of Maryland where he farms.  
**[0:33:57-0:34:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:33:57):**  You can already get paid for it by the USDA.  
**[0:34:00-0:34:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:34:00):**  And he literally said in another article, not the main article where he talked about  
**[0:34:04-0:34:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:34:04):**  getting the money, but in another article that it has been a net benefit for his business  
**[0:34:07-0:34:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:34:07):**  just by existing because it's limited the amount of passes he has to make in the field.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:34:11):**  So he's saving on diesel, he's saving on, right?  
**[0:34:13-0:34:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:34:13):**  He would have done this anyway.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:34:15):**  That's not what we're supposed to be paying for.  
**[0:34:19-0:34:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:34:19):**  And basically what we're rewarding at this point is holdouts.  
**[0:34:22-0:34:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:34:22):**  We're telling farmers, the longer you hold out, the more we'll pay.  
**[0:34:25-0:34:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:34:25):**  The longer you hold.  
**[0:34:28-0:34:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:34:28):**  Someone made this analogy to me the other day.  
**[0:34:30-0:34:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:34:30):**  It's literally like farmers are standing in their yard with a chainsaw in their hands  
**[0:34:34-0:34:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:34:34):**  saying if you don't pay me, I'll cut this tree down.  
**[0:34:36-0:34:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:34:36):**  And we say, please keep the engine running, but don't touch the tree yet.  
**[0:34:40-0:34:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:34:40):**  Yeah.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:34:41):**  And we're putting diesel and petrol in the machine just to continue running.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:34:44):**  And we're just letting it happen instead of just saying like, you know, putting a fence  
**[0:34:47-0:34:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:34:47):**  around the tree or taking away the chainsaw.  
**[0:34:50-0:34:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:34:50):**  We're just saying like, okay, okay, don't worry.  
**[0:34:52-0:34:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:34:52):**  We'll pay.  
**[0:34:53-0:34:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:34:53):**  We'll pay.  
**[0:34:54-0:34:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:34:54):**  And it's like, no, no, we already paid.  
**[0:34:57-0:34:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:34:57):**  This is over.  
**[0:34:58-0:35:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:34:58):**  We're not doing this anymore.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:35:00):**  And I think I was actually just reading a fascinating part of The End of the Myth, Greg  
**[0:35:05-0:35:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:35:05):**  Grandin's book that he published last year and won a Pulitzer for.  
**[0:35:09-0:35:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:35:09):**  He talks about basically during the New Deal in the United States that New Deal Democrats  
**[0:35:15-0:35:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:35:15):**  in particular had gone to Mexico, spent a lot of time with the Mexican government at  
**[0:35:19-0:35:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:35:19):**  a time when the Mexican government was doing massive land reform and how many benefits  
**[0:35:24-0:35:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:35:24):**  that the Mexican government saw and the Mexican people saw and also how much FDR is basically  
**[0:35:30-0:35:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:35:30):**  like administration, including people at the USDA, were excited about like, oh, we see  
**[0:35:35-0:35:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:35:35):**  how many of our issues in the United States are tied directly to the fact that way too  
**[0:35:40-0:35:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:35:40):**  few people own way too much land.  
**[0:35:44-0:35:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:35:44):**  And that's the thing.  
**[0:35:45-0:35:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:35:45):**  Like I talk about this quite a bit in the book, but like that owning too much land is  
**[0:35:49-0:35:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:35:49):**  what causes labor exploitation.  
**[0:35:51-0:35:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:35:51):**  Like if you own too much land and you can't monetize it, then you have to get labor for  
**[0:35:55-0:35:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:35:55):**  free to work it.  
**[0:35:56-0:35:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:35:56):**  There's no other way.  
**[0:35:57-0:35:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:35:57):**  And that led to chattel slavery.  
**[0:35:58-0:36:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:35:58):**  It led to the Pricero program.  
**[0:36:00-0:36:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:36:00):**  It led to Japanese and Asian-American racism in California.  
**[0:36:05-0:36:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:36:05):**  It led to today's modern immigration system.  
**[0:36:08-0:36:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:36:08):**  The evidence is everywhere in American agriculture that we have too much land in too few hands  
**[0:36:13-0:36:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:36:13):**  that can't afford to work it.  
**[0:36:16-0:36:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:36:16):**  And so we like abuse labor to get it done.  
**[0:36:18-0:36:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:36:18):**  And all we do is further concentrate the land in fewer and fewer hands.  
**[0:36:22-0:36:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:36:22):**  And at the end of all of that, we get sad that farmers are so old and that young farmers  
**[0:36:26-0:36:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:36:26):**  can't find a way back to the land.  
**[0:36:28-0:36:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:36:28):**  But of course they can't.  
**[0:36:30-0:36:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:36:30):**  Saying why don't more farmers own farmland, young farmers own farmland is like saying,  
**[0:36:34-0:36:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:36:34):**  why don't more young people have trust funds?  
**[0:36:36-0:36:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:36:36):**  You need money to begin with.  
**[0:36:37-0:36:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:36:37):**  So how does that go into Sylvan Aqua?  
**[0:36:41-0:36:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:36:41):**  As you mentioned before, you don't own the land, you're farming and you don't own the  
**[0:36:44-0:36:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:36:44):**  land in the future.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:36:45):**  There will be a land trust, et cetera.  
**[0:36:46-0:36:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:36:46):**  How does that work on fixing that land ownership issue or partly fixing it, or at least make  
**[0:36:51-0:36:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:36:51):**  a step in the right direction?  
**[0:36:53-0:36:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:36:53):**  What's the thinking and more importantly actually doing there?  
**[0:36:55-0:36:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:36:55):**  Yeah.  
**[0:36:56-0:36:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:36:56):**  So two different things are happening.  
**[0:36:57-0:36:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:36:57):**  So on the one hand, we are very lucky.  
**[0:36:59-0:37:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:36:59):**  Chris Newman builds this amazing business, which I think in Sylvan Aqua's case, the brand  
**[0:37:04-0:37:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:37:04):**  alone has a lot of value.  
**[0:37:05-0:37:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:37:05):**  Again, another thing that a lot of farms don't think about very thoughtfully is that like,  
**[0:37:10-0:37:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:37:10):**  yes, when you build a successful business, things besides just your tractor and your  
**[0:37:15-0:37:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:37:15):**  acres have value.  
**[0:37:17-0:37:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:37:17):**  Like the Instagram account.  
**[0:37:18-0:37:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:37:18):**  Yeah.  
**[0:37:19-0:37:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:37:19):**  And the goodwill and the sales and actually having clients and that whole infrastructure.  
**[0:37:24-0:37:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:37:24):**  Exactly.  
**[0:37:25-0:37:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:37:25):**  The sales channels, all of that stuff has value.  
**[0:37:27-0:37:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:37:27):**  So we are at this moment, even though we don't have land and even though we can't do the  
**[0:37:32-0:37:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:37:32):**  thing of like, yeah, everyone gets some land so that we all, even when our paychecks aren't  
**[0:37:36-0:37:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:37:36):**  very big, at least we know we're growing long-term wealth.  
**[0:37:38-0:37:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:37:38):**  We don't have that opportunity, but we do.  
**[0:37:40-0:37:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:37:40):**  We are growing a business, a real business that has real value.  
**[0:37:43-0:37:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:37:43):**  And every person at Sylvan Aqua has a path to ownership.  
**[0:37:46-0:37:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:37:46):**  I am personally on a path to a path to partnership.  
**[0:37:48-0:37:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:37:48):**  So not like exclusive ownership, but I'm on a path to partnership, which is really exciting  
**[0:37:52-0:37:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:37:52):**  for me.  
**[0:37:53-0:37:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:37:53):**  Coming from journalism where that's not the case.  
**[0:37:56-0:37:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:37:56):**  Never the case.  
**[0:37:57-0:38:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:37:57):**  Or you're sort of a paid, I mean, book obviously, but it really has to go well to make any sense  
**[0:38:02-0:38:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:38:02):**  and or the substack world of this, the premium, et cetera.  
**[0:38:06-0:38:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:38:06):**  But yeah, I think ownership in a farming business and a food business is more interesting.  
**[0:38:10-0:38:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:38:10):**  Oh, for sure.  
**[0:38:11-0:38:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:38:11):**  Not to mention that it's just, it's a team and working with a good team is never something  
**[0:38:15-0:38:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:38:15):**  to be taken for granted because it's rare.  
**[0:38:18-0:38:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:38:18):**  So that's how we're dealing with ownership and partnership on our end.  
**[0:38:20-0:38:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:38:20):**  And then in addition to, so that's within Sylvan Aqua Farms, which is kind of the central  
**[0:38:24-0:38:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:38:24):**  umbrella of the organization.  
**[0:38:26-0:38:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:38:26):**  And then within the system, there's networked farms.  
**[0:38:29-0:38:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:38:29):**  So we have right now 40 acres community ranch and Choptico farm, which are both separate  
**[0:38:35-0:38:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:38:35):**  businesses with their own owners owned by 40 acre community ranch is black owned and  
**[0:38:42-0:38:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:38:42):**  run right now.  
**[0:38:43-0:38:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:38:43):**  And Choptico is a, like a vegetable produce operation that is currently owned and operated  
**[0:38:50-0:38:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:38:50):**  by this really cool group of people.  
**[0:38:52-0:38:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:38:52):**  So there's basically those two ways.  
**[0:38:53-0:38:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:38:53):**  You can either join Sylvan Aqua as like a part of one of the businesses and work your  
**[0:38:57-0:39:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:38:57):**  way into ownership of that business, or you could join as a business and just kind of  
**[0:39:01-0:39:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:39:01):**  get plugged into the network.  
**[0:39:02-0:39:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:39:02):**  And we have some standards around what that means, what that looks like in terms of both  
**[0:39:05-0:39:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:39:05):**  environmental stewardship and economic interrelation with the other businesses in the organization.  
**[0:39:11-0:39:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:39:11):**  The land trust element of this and how we get the land ownership piece is a little bit  
**[0:39:16-0:39:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:39:16):**  further down the line for us right now.  
**[0:39:17-0:39:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:39:17):**  We're actually in the market, the nonprofit part of what we do, which is called something  
**[0:39:22-0:39:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:39:22):**  else society is going to have a land trust, going to hold some land in common that we  
**[0:39:27-0:39:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:39:27):**  can then, you know, distribute leases for our farms, the farms in the system.  
**[0:39:30-0:39:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:39:30):**  Yeah, because you don't want to be the one, like a lot of people are leasing, you're building  
**[0:39:35-0:39:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:39:35):**  a lot of, first of all, you're building a business, you're building soil, you're rebuilding  
**[0:39:38-0:39:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:39:38):**  a lot of things that somebody else extracted, and then you're kicked off the land and you  
**[0:39:43-0:39:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:39:43):**  have to move somewhere else, which is painful, but also just very, very destructive.  
**[0:39:48-0:39:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:39:48):**  And you don't want that.  
**[0:39:49-0:39:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:39:49):**  Yeah.  
**[0:39:50-0:39:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:39:50):**  Yes, totally.  
**[0:39:51-0:39:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:39:51):**  So we are, that organization will buy farmland and rent out to, you know, do like 99 year  
**[0:39:56-0:40:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:39:56):**  leases with organizations in the network, which is great.  
**[0:40:00-0:40:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:40:00):**  One way to do, and you know, we're taking our cues in particular from people like the  
**[0:40:04-0:40:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:40:04):**  Hutterites in the Dakotas in Montana here in the United States, which have basically,  
**[0:40:09-0:40:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:40:09):**  you know, by doing many of the things that we are doing, which is like farming communally,  
**[0:40:14-0:40:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:40:14):**  paying people well, acting like businesses instead of small family independent farms  
**[0:40:19-0:40:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:40:19):**  that are really about transferring land wealth, they have just out competed all other land  
**[0:40:24-0:40:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:40:24):**  buyers in their area.  
**[0:40:25-0:40:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:40:25):**  Like they just, it doesn't matter if they want land, they show up to an auction and  
**[0:40:28-0:40:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:40:28):**  they just like, they just can beat every bid for land they want.  
**[0:40:31-0:40:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:40:31):**  And for us, you know, Sylvan Ok was based in the Chesapeake Bay.  
**[0:40:34-0:40:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:40:34):**  This is our food shed.  
**[0:40:35-0:40:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:40:35):**  This is our watershed.  
**[0:40:36-0:40:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:40:36):**  Like we care about this land a ton and we just want to owner control and be able to  
**[0:40:41-0:40:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:40:41):**  have an influence over as much of this land as possible, whether that means by buying  
**[0:40:44-0:40:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:40:44):**  it, whether that means by leasing it or by doing a third thing, which is called farming  
**[0:40:49-0:40:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:40:49):**  as a service, which is where we help people do landscape management.  
**[0:40:53-0:40:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:40:53):**  Basically we do like indigenous landscape management for private landowners, usually  
**[0:40:58-0:41:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:40:58):**  like, you know, people who own like estates or big pieces of property that they would  
**[0:41:02-0:41:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:41:02):**  like, like manage as natural systems for hunting or fishing or outdoor recreation, whatever  
**[0:41:07-0:41:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:41:07):**  that looks like.  
**[0:41:08-0:41:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:41:08):**  Basically to influence as much as possible whenever you can buy and bring it into the  
**[0:41:12-0:41:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:41:12):**  commons you do.  
**[0:41:13-0:41:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:41:13):**  And as you have a very, very long-term view anyway, like pieces will come on the market  
**[0:41:17-0:41:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:41:17):**  at some point or will be, I wouldn't say donated, but for lower prices as you've been working  
**[0:41:21-0:41:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:41:21):**  with some of these estates over the years.  
**[0:41:23-0:41:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:41:23):**  I mean, that will, will happen.  
**[0:41:24-0:41:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:41:24):**  I have to think of a story once, I think from a museum that was looking at a piece for a  
**[0:41:29-0:41:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:41:29):**  long, long time to buy it and basically said, yeah, we're in this business for centuries  
**[0:41:33-0:41:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:41:33):**  anyway.  
**[0:41:34-0:41:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:41:34):**  So at some point it will come, like we'll know.  
**[0:41:35-0:41:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:41:35):**  Exactly.  
**[0:41:36-0:41:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:41:36):**  It could take 40 years, could take 50, it doesn't really matter.  
**[0:41:38-0:41:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:41:38):**  We're in this watershed for a hundred years.  
**[0:41:40-0:41:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:41:40):**  At some point we'll control or at least influence most of it.  
**[0:41:43-0:41:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:41:43):**  And we're not tied to one piece.  
**[0:41:45-0:41:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:41:45):**  Yes or one piece.  
**[0:41:46-0:41:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:41:46):**  No, it doesn't really, it doesn't really matter.  
**[0:41:48-0:41:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:41:48):**  That's interesting.  
**[0:41:49-0:41:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:41:49):**  Exactly.  
**[0:41:50-0:41:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:41:50):**  And so to like the indigenous ethic that informs, you know, this comes from Chris Newman and  
**[0:41:53-0:41:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:41:53):**  also other indigenous people on our team.  
**[0:41:56-0:41:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:41:56):**  Yeah.  
**[0:41:57-0:42:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:41:57):**  I mean, agriculture in its added, its essence like operates at the landscape level.  
**[0:42:01-0:42:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:42:01):**  Nature doesn't care where your property line is.  
**[0:42:03-0:42:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:42:03):**  So it, when we're talking about, you know, our ethic, it doesn't make sense to say, you  
**[0:42:08-0:42:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:42:08):**  know, we're just going to buy this 70 acres and we're going to take really good care of  
**[0:42:11-0:42:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:42:11):**  it and like, by golly, I hope everyone else does too.  
**[0:42:13-0:42:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:42:13):**  I've knew it's not going to happen.  
**[0:42:15-0:42:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:42:15):**  Yeah.  
**[0:42:16-0:42:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:42:16):**  The right way to think about it.  
**[0:42:17-0:42:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:42:17):**  Yeah.  
**[0:42:18-0:42:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:42:18):**  That's it doesn't.  
**[0:42:19-0:42:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:42:19):**  Yeah.  
**[0:42:20-0:42:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:42:20):**  So, you know, the air that's been polluted, air that's been polluted, soil, invasive species,  
**[0:42:24-0:42:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:42:24):**  like those things do not stop at your property line.  
**[0:42:26-0:42:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:42:26):**  So we know that if we want to rejuvenate the ecosystem around here, if we want to feed  
**[0:42:32-0:42:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:42:32):**  our communities in a, you know, culturally relevant way that it cannot be small, we have  
**[0:42:37-0:42:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:42:37):**  to operate at scale.  
**[0:42:38-0:42:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:42:38):**  And so, yeah, we're not afraid to one realize that like we need hundreds of employees and  
**[0:42:42-0:42:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:42:42):**  we need to compensate them in basically whatever way that they need to be compensated in.  
**[0:42:46-0:42:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:42:46):**  We need to support lots of different kinds of businesses run in lots of different ways.  
**[0:42:50-0:42:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:42:50):**  It's truly a system.  
**[0:42:51-0:42:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:42:51):**  It's truly decentralized and it's still very much being built.  
**[0:42:56-0:42:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:42:56):**  That's what makes it exciting.  
**[0:42:57-0:43:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:42:57):**  I mean, it's interesting to go to Mondragon in Basque country, et cetera, where it's still  
**[0:43:01-0:43:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:43:01):**  being built as well, but it feels much more established with, I don't know how many banks  
**[0:43:04-0:43:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:43:04):**  they have in universities and one of the biggest cooperatives in the world.  
**[0:43:08-0:43:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:43:08):**  But this is like those guys 40, 50, 60 years ago, which is potentially, I mean, we still  
**[0:43:13-0:43:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:43:13):**  don't know, but it's very interesting to see that birth of a lot of these things.  
**[0:43:18-0:43:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:43:18):**  Yeah, hopefully.  
**[0:43:19-0:43:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:43:19):**  I mean, yeah, and we're, you know, one of our priorities is very much just like transparency  
**[0:43:23-0:43:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:43:23):**  and communication.  
**[0:43:24-0:43:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:43:24):**  We spend a lot of time talking on social media and elsewhere about what we're doing and just  
**[0:43:28-0:43:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:43:28):**  trying to get people excited, get people involved and yeah, trying to push back on some of these  
**[0:43:35-0:43:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:43:35):**  ideas around, you know, I'm sure that's something that Chris talked with you about was just  
**[0:43:40-0:43:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:43:40):**  so many good intentioned people out in the world who are just like, oh, like let me come  
**[0:43:43-0:43:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:43:43):**  by the farm, let me volunteer, let me do whatever I can.  
**[0:43:45-0:43:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:43:45):**  And just like trying to change the conversation around that of like, we're a business and  
**[0:43:50-0:43:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:43:50):**  we don't actually want or need volunteers because that's not how our business runs.  
**[0:43:54-0:43:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:43:54):**  But like we appreciate it and we like love fans and we'd like love for you to buy our  
**[0:43:58-0:44:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:43:58):**  product and like figure out what it means, what products we could carry for you to buy  
**[0:44:02-0:44:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:44:02):**  them.  
**[0:44:03-0:44:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:44:03):**  It's just, we've really trained people, especially people who are really mindful about the environment  
**[0:44:07-0:44:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:44:07):**  or really care about regenerative food.  
**[0:44:10-0:44:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:44:10):**  I like to think of us, I'm definitely part of this, the like omnivores dilemma generation  
**[0:44:14-0:44:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:44:14):**  of people who were awakened by those kinds of writings.  
**[0:44:17-0:44:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:44:17):**  Third plate.  
**[0:44:18-0:44:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:44:18):**  Yeah.  
**[0:44:19-0:44:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:44:19):**  The training you got out of that is like volunteer at farms, shop at the farmer's market, pay  
**[0:44:23-0:44:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:44:23):**  attention to farms, like basically like cater to their needs.  
**[0:44:28-0:44:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:44:28):**  And so we're trying to do a little bit of retraining around like, Hey, it's okay for  
**[0:44:32-0:44:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:44:32):**  you to tell us what you want.  
**[0:44:34-0:44:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:44:34):**  We're a business.  
**[0:44:35-0:44:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:44:35):**  We're going to respond to your needs as a customer.  
**[0:44:37-0:44:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:44:37):**  Either be a customer, invest or come work with us.  
**[0:44:40-0:44:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:44:40):**  But yeah.  
**[0:44:41-0:44:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:44:41):**  Exactly.  
**[0:44:42-0:44:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:44:42):**  But you don't need to like volunteer.  
**[0:44:43-0:44:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:44:43):**  You don't need to be sorry to ask a question.  
**[0:44:47-0:44:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:44:47):**  Yeah.  
**[0:44:48-0:44:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:44:48):**  And so let's shift gears a bit because I'm going to be cautious of your time.  
**[0:44:50-0:44:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:44:50):**  I think we can talk for hours, but you wrote a book.  
**[0:44:53-0:44:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:44:53):**  You just sent it in last week.  
**[0:44:55-0:44:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:44:55):**  We're talking beginning of March.  
**[0:44:57-0:45:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:44:57):**  It's going to come out at 21st of April, the first one, the second one in December.  
**[0:45:00-0:45:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:45:00):**  What's the book about farming and other F words, which by the way is an amazing title,  
**[0:45:04-0:45:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:45:04):**  but what's the essence of why should people preorder in a couple of weeks when it, the  
**[0:45:09-0:45:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:45:09):**  preorders go up?  
**[0:45:10-0:45:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:45:10):**  Sure.  
**[0:45:11-0:45:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:45:11):**  So the title is the rise and fall of small family farms.  
**[0:45:13-0:45:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:45:13):**  So I will say it is about my journey of, you know, the book spans several years.  
**[0:45:21-0:45:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:45:21):**  I started writing it in about 2015, 16 you'll meet Chris Newman on his very first farm intro  
**[0:45:28-0:45:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:45:28):**  outside of Charlottesville VA and then, you know, journey across.  
**[0:45:31-0:45:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:45:31):**  You'll meet old farms, new farms, big farms, small farms.  
**[0:45:34-0:45:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:45:34):**  I promise it's not a Dr. Seuss book.  
**[0:45:35-0:45:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:45:35):**  I'm realizing just now that that's what it sounds like.  
**[0:45:38-0:45:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:45:38):**  Don't worry.  
**[0:45:39-0:45:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:45:39):**  Yeah.  
**[0:45:40-0:45:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:45:40):**  And so I look at all of these questions, so many of the questions that we've talked about  
**[0:45:44-0:45:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:45:44):**  here really closely.  
**[0:45:45-0:45:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:45:45):**  I think I at different points in this journey really came to a lot of the questions I had  
**[0:45:51-0:45:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:45:51):**  and kept coming back around to centered around exploitation.  
**[0:45:54-0:45:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:45:54):**  And I think there's so much exploitation in agriculture, exploitation of natural systems,  
**[0:45:58-0:46:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:45:58):**  of farmers themselves and their families of workers, obviously for obvious reasons of  
**[0:46:03-0:46:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:46:03):**  the animals and plants involved in agriculture.  
**[0:46:06-0:46:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:46:06):**  And just looking, you know, we have this idea of what a good farm is.  
**[0:46:13-0:46:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:46:13):**  This idea of like the good farm is very central to the book of just like, you know, if I told  
**[0:46:17-0:46:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:46:17):**  you we're fighting for small family farms and you said, yeah, you're thinking of a very  
**[0:46:21-0:46:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:46:21):**  specific farm.  
**[0:46:23-0:46:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:46:23):**  You're thinking of like a, you know, maybe a few dozen to a few hundred acres owned and  
**[0:46:27-0:46:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:46:27):**  operated by a family where the family contributes all their labor and like, you know, earns  
**[0:46:31-0:46:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:46:31):**  not an excessive income, but you know, a stable income.  
**[0:46:35-0:46:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:46:35):**  They have a very centered focus on the community and feeding people local to them.  
**[0:46:39-0:46:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:46:39):**  They're the original environmentalists.  
**[0:46:40-0:46:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:46:40):**  They're very mindful about the way that what they do might impact future generations.  
**[0:46:44-0:46:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:46:44):**  They're super hardworking.  
**[0:46:47-0:46:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:46:47):**  They have this incredible land ethic.  
**[0:46:48-0:46:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:46:48):**  They wake up really early, you know, down to like their kids play in the hayloft and  
**[0:46:53-0:46:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:46:53):**  they drive the tractor.  
**[0:46:54-0:46:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:46:54):**  I feel there's a but coming.  
**[0:46:55-0:46:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:46:55):**  Well, so basically like the point of this book, like what I was doing is just like,  
**[0:46:59-0:47:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:46:59):**  can I find that farm?  
**[0:47:01-0:47:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:47:01):**  Like how close do we get?  
**[0:47:02-0:47:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:47:02):**  And in what ways do the farms that actually exist in the world fall short?  
**[0:47:06-0:47:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:47:06):**  And it there's a lot of data in there.  
**[0:47:08-0:47:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:47:08):**  There's a lot of interesting kind of examination of what's available from USDA where the USDA  
**[0:47:13-0:47:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:47:13):**  falls short in counting farms, which is like a whole other thing.  
**[0:47:16-0:47:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:47:16):**  You know, who gets money?  
**[0:47:18-0:47:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:47:18):**  Who are we helping when we like go to farm aid or when we donate to nonprofits or when  
**[0:47:23-0:47:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:47:23):**  we go to the farmers market even?  
**[0:47:25-0:47:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:47:25):**  I tell I'll spoiler alert for the first chapter.  
**[0:47:28-0:47:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:47:28):**  So it's not that big of a spoiler.  
**[0:47:29-0:47:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:47:29):**  But I talked to a farmer I know in the Pacific Northwest who has been doing like a market  
**[0:47:34-0:47:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:47:34):**  garden, 15 acres of market garden for 25 years, you know, came on at the very birth outside  
**[0:47:41-0:47:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:47:41):**  of Seattle at the very birth of kind of the food movement was producing over 200 vegetables  
**[0:47:45-0:47:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:47:45):**  regeneratively and sustainably by the time that she, you know, spoiler alert, quit farming.  
**[0:47:50-0:47:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:47:50):**  And it was basically like, you know, the most interesting tidbit that she told me was that  
**[0:47:55-0:47:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:47:55):**  when she first announced that she was going to quit farming, the number of people who  
**[0:47:58-0:48:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:47:58):**  came to her and or sent her an email or something to say like, oh, I'm going to be so sad to  
**[0:48:02-0:48:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:48:02):**  not see you at the farmers market.  
**[0:48:03-0:48:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:48:03):**  She hadn't been to the farmers market in six years.  
**[0:48:06-0:48:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:48:06):**  So just like this whole idea of like, you know, all of these things that we learned  
**[0:48:10-0:48:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:48:10):**  being children of the omnivore dilemma of like, you know, go to the farmers market,  
**[0:48:14-0:48:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:48:14):**  get to know your farmer, ask a farmer when you have a question, like there's those ideas  
**[0:48:19-0:48:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:48:19):**  that we strive for.  
**[0:48:20-0:48:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:48:20):**  And then there's what's actually happening.  
**[0:48:22-0:48:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:48:22):**  And I think that kind of the point of this book is to just try and understand, you know,  
**[0:48:26-0:48:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:48:26):**  we have our ideals and we have in a lot of spaces in agriculture, we let the nebulousness  
**[0:48:33-0:48:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:48:33):**  of the ideal stand as just like, you know, this is how when you hear someone from the  
**[0:48:38-0:48:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:48:38):**  Farm Bureau say like, we need to do whatever it takes to defend small family farms.  
**[0:48:42-0:48:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:48:42):**  And then somehow you hear someone from like the environmental community agree with them  
**[0:48:46-0:48:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:48:46):**  and you're like, oh, they must be on the same page.  
**[0:48:49-0:48:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:48:49):**  And just like how much ambiguity there is in the middle of, you know, what exactly do  
**[0:48:53-0:48:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:48:53):**  different people mean by a good farm and what does that mean for people who think that there's  
**[0:48:59-0:49:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:48:59):**  problems with the food system, people who think there's a problem with the farming system  
**[0:49:02-0:49:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:49:02):**  and like basically where we go from here.  
**[0:49:05-0:49:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:49:05):**  And that's what Farm and Other Efforts is about is basically, you know, is the small  
**[0:49:09-0:49:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:49:09):**  family farm really the unit of agriculture that makes the most sense if we're talking  
**[0:49:14-0:49:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:49:14):**  about a hotter, drier future where we need to feed more people better?  
**[0:49:18-0:49:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:49:18):**  I have a feeling it's not.  
**[0:49:22-0:49:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:49:22):**  Deeper book spoiler, I will say, is just like, you know what?  
**[0:49:25-0:49:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:49:25):**  Only in America, really, or in America and Europe, do we think that small family farms  
**[0:49:30-0:49:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:49:30):**  were ever like the peak of human existence.  
**[0:49:33-0:49:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:49:33):**  It's not common in the rest of the world that we like all strive to retire to a farm one  
**[0:49:38-0:49:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:49:38):**  day.  
**[0:49:39-0:49:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:49:39):**  Most people in the world don't do that.  
**[0:49:41-0:49:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:49:41):**  And then the second book is like the second part of that.  
**[0:49:43-0:49:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:49:43):**  It doesn't have a title yet.  
**[0:49:44-0:49:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:49:44):**  I'm working title is like big team farms.  
**[0:49:47-0:49:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:49:47):**  It's basically a playbook of I've called it like the lean startup of farming.  
**[0:49:52-0:49:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:49:52):**  Where it's just like how to what are big team farms?  
**[0:49:55-0:49:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:49:55):**  Where do they exist right now?  
**[0:49:56-0:49:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:49:56):**  How are they working?  
**[0:49:57-0:49:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:49:57):**  What are their challenges?  
**[0:49:58-0:50:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:49:58):**  What are their solutions, etc.  
**[0:50:00-0:50:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:50:00):**  It'll be super interesting.  
**[0:50:01-0:50:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:50:01):**  And now I would love to end with a few questions I always like to ask.  
**[0:50:06-0:50:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:50:06):**  And to start with one, I mean, you mentioned let's not see farming as an investment.  
**[0:50:11-0:50:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:50:11):**  But let's say you somehow magically tomorrow morning are in charge of a one billion dollar  
**[0:50:16-0:50:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:50:16):**  or any large amount because it doesn't have to be one billion investment portfolio and  
**[0:50:21-0:50:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:50:21):**  obviously charge them.  
**[0:50:22-0:50:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:50:22):**  OK, how do we make farming regenerative Lee but actually regenerative to the core meaning  
**[0:50:27-0:50:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:50:27):**  including everything, not just soil.  
**[0:50:29-0:50:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:50:29):**  What would you focus on?  
**[0:50:30-0:50:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:50:30):**  What would you invest or how would you put this money to work?  
**[0:50:34-0:50:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:50:34):**  How would you prioritize?  
**[0:50:35-0:50:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:50:35):**  That's mostly why I asked this question.  
**[0:50:37-0:50:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:50:37):**  Yeah, that is tough.  
**[0:50:39-0:50:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:50:39):**  And if it wasn't just I mean, if the main priority is regenerative agriculture is like  
**[0:50:44-0:50:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:50:44):**  environmental outcomes.  
**[0:50:45-0:50:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:50:45):**  Now, I've said regeneration in general, like this is much I see usually ag is a nice Trojan  
**[0:50:51-0:50:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:50:51):**  horse to get into a lot of other conversations on inequality, access, health, very wide health,  
**[0:50:57-0:50:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:50:57):**  not just physical health, etc, etc.  
**[0:50:59-0:51:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:50:59):**  So if you literally you have the freedom to invest it, whatever you want, could all be  
**[0:51:04-0:51:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:51:04):**  an ag tech if you really want to.  
**[0:51:05-0:51:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:51:05):**  But oh, yeah, no, no, no, definitely not.  
**[0:51:07-0:51:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:51:07):**  Well, I guess the other question is, like, what is my time scale for having a return  
**[0:51:11-0:51:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:51:11):**  on this money?  
**[0:51:13-0:51:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:51:13):**  So it has to come back at some point, return could be zero or very low, and it could be  
**[0:51:17-0:51:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:51:17):**  very, very long.  
**[0:51:18-0:51:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:51:18):**  So you actually have the freedom and space to do 99 year things if you want to.  
**[0:51:23-0:51:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:51:23):**  Okay, it's not a 10 year fund, let's say.  
**[0:51:25-0:51:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:51:25):**  Okay, great, because that would make a difference.  
**[0:51:28-0:51:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:51:28):**  You know, I think you could do something really interesting with like partnering with I would  
**[0:51:32-0:51:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:51:32):**  love to get I mean, we talked about indigenous leadership and regenerative ag a lot.  
**[0:51:36-0:51:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:51:36):**  I think you could partner with with a billion dollars, you could partner with a tribe and  
**[0:51:40-0:51:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:51:40):**  buy a significant amount of land back.  
**[0:51:42-0:51:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:51:42):**  And just like, you know, I think the impact that that kind of experiment would have just  
**[0:51:47-0:51:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:51:47):**  on people seeing what's possible.  
**[0:51:50-0:51:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:51:50):**  We talk a lot about, you know, indigenous communities protect the vast majority of remaining  
**[0:51:55-0:52:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:51:55):**  wildlands in the world and biodiversity while only owning a very small percentage.  
**[0:52:01-0:52:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:52:01):**  Yeah, seed keeping and like advanced seed breeding.  
**[0:52:04-0:52:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:52:04):**  So much of that that like is being discovered right now is, yeah, is actually, you know,  
**[0:52:09-0:52:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:52:09):**  indigenous knowledge that has been captured or recaptured or repurposed or their role  
**[0:52:15-0:52:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:52:15):**  is often erased.  
**[0:52:16-0:52:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:52:16):**  So that would be probably my first instinct is just like one buy a lot of land because  
**[0:52:20-0:52:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:52:20):**  land is always the biggest barrier and put indigenous agricultural leaders in charge  
**[0:52:26-0:52:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:52:26):**  and see what they do.  
**[0:52:27-0:52:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:52:27):**  Like what that I would love to say that I like know how to unlock all the most value  
**[0:52:31-0:52:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:52:31):**  and figure out how to do the best stuff.  
**[0:52:34-0:52:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:52:34):**  But I think Chris Newman talks about this in a really powerful way.  
**[0:52:37-0:52:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:52:37):**  So I won't try to paraphrase him.  
**[0:52:38-0:52:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:52:38):**  But people who have traditionally been without resources or in marginalized positions have  
**[0:52:46-0:52:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:52:46):**  built this really amazing skill of operating in the world despite that operating with fewer  
**[0:52:52-0:52:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:52:52):**  resources, operating, you know, on the margins of communities and fixing stuff and getting  
**[0:52:57-0:52:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:52:57):**  stuff.  
**[0:52:58-0:52:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:52:58):**  Yeah.  
**[0:52:59-0:53:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:52:59):**  And that's the thing is like I think a billion dollars given to a tech company would be a  
**[0:53:01-0:53:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:53:01):**  lot more wastefully spent than a billion dollars given to an indigenous community and get out  
**[0:53:06-0:53:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:53:06):**  of the way.  
**[0:53:07-0:53:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:53:07):**  Probably that's the best.  
**[0:53:08-0:53:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:53:08):**  Oh, yeah.  
**[0:53:09-0:53:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:53:09):**  And then make sure that you use I mean, maybe you spend some amount of that money making  
**[0:53:12-0:53:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:53:12):**  sure people get out of the way.  
**[0:53:14-0:53:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:53:14):**  But yeah, I think, you know, if you could buy back the other half of Oklahoma and just  
**[0:53:19-0:53:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:53:19):**  giving it to local tribes there, if you could buy a lot of North Carolina for a billion  
**[0:53:24-0:53:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:53:24):**  dollars.  
**[0:53:26-0:53:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:53:26):**  It sounds insane to say that, but I think it's true.  
**[0:53:28-0:53:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:53:28):**  And you know, offering more empowerment to like the Lumbee tribe or something like that,  
**[0:53:31-0:53:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:53:31):**  the Gullah Geechee in the coastal Carolinas.  
**[0:53:34-0:53:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:53:34):**  You could buy not a lot of beachfront for a billion dollars, but you could buy a lot  
**[0:53:37-0:53:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:53:37):**  of like coastal upland that you could do some awesome regenerative ag stuff with.  
**[0:53:42-0:53:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:53:42):**  And then I think, yeah, so much of what what we've accepted is possible.  
**[0:53:47-0:53:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:53:47):**  And I think carbon markets are in the same place of, you know, we farmers, especially  
**[0:53:52-0:53:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:53:52):**  big conventional farmers, sat out of climate discussions and were active climate deniers  
**[0:53:55-0:53:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:53:55):**  for decades, decades and decades.  
**[0:53:57-0:54:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:53:57):**  And the minute they walk into the conversation and decide to participate, we let them be  
**[0:54:01-0:54:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:54:01):**  in charge.  
**[0:54:02-0:54:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:54:02):**  What?  
**[0:54:03-0:54:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:54:03):**  What is that instinct?  
**[0:54:04-0:54:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:54:04):**  Like, what?  
**[0:54:05-0:54:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:54:05):**  And we know where the instinct comes from, right?  
**[0:54:09-0:54:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:54:09):**  From like all of us being trained to like ask a farmer and who can make rules for farmers  
**[0:54:13-0:54:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:54:13):**  except farmers.  
**[0:54:14-0:54:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:54:14):**  We have to let farmers do it.  
**[0:54:15-0:54:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:54:15):**  Would we say the same for an oil executive?  
**[0:54:17-0:54:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:54:17):**  Like would we let the oil industry run their own regulation or?  
**[0:54:20-0:54:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:54:20):**  We do a bit, but yeah, but we at least we know.  
**[0:54:24-0:54:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:54:24):**  We don't feel good about it.  
**[0:54:25-0:54:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:54:25):**  We aren't saying like, yes, we're doing this right because like we're letting.  
**[0:54:29-0:54:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:54:29):**  Look at this round table.  
**[0:54:30-0:54:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:54:30):**  Yeah.  
**[0:54:31-0:54:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:54:31):**  Yeah.  
**[0:54:32-0:54:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:54:32):**  I think we serve up, right?  
**[0:54:33-0:54:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:54:33):**  So many of the possible solutions that we've taken off the table in agriculture, whether  
**[0:54:36-0:54:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:54:36):**  it's like communal farming, whether it's changes in the way that we, that land is available  
**[0:54:41-0:54:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:54:41):**  and like tax credits work for land ownership and doing, you know, like letting indigenous  
**[0:54:45-0:54:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:54:45):**  leadership.  
**[0:54:46-0:54:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:54:46):**  I get that pushback all the time, which again is blatant racism of like when I plug indigenous  
**[0:54:51-0:54:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:54:51):**  agriculture, people are like, we can't go back to being hunters and gatherers.  
**[0:54:54-0:54:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:54:54):**  Well one, you're an idiot.  
**[0:54:56-0:54:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:54:56):**  Native Americans were not hunters and gatherers.  
**[0:54:58-0:54:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:54:58):**  They were advanced agriculturalists.  
**[0:54:59-0:55:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:54:59):**  They created corn, which is literally so advanced.  
**[0:55:02-0:55:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:55:02):**  We don't understand how it works.  
**[0:55:03-0:55:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:55:03):**  Like we don't understand how it evolved.  
**[0:55:05-0:55:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:55:05):**  They managed incredible landscapes.  
**[0:55:07-0:55:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:55:07):**  That is a size that we can only dream about.  
**[0:55:10-0:55:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:55:10):**  Yeah.  
**[0:55:11-0:55:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:55:11):**  There are places in Mesoamerica where they have grown corn and other highly extractive  
**[0:55:16-0:55:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:55:16):**  crops for 4,000 years continuously.  
**[0:55:19-0:55:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:55:19):**  There's no place else on earth that can like make that claim.  
**[0:55:23-0:55:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:55:23):**  That can say we were such advanced agriculturalists that we were able to continuously crop this  
**[0:55:28-0:55:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:55:28):**  area over and over again for not a generation, not three generations or five generations,  
**[0:55:34-0:55:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:55:34):**  for 4,000 years.  
**[0:55:35-0:55:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:55:35):**  So the idea that people are like indigenous people, you know, don't have the capacity  
**[0:55:39-0:55:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:55:39):**  or don't have the skills or don't have the abilities to be leaders in this is one just  
**[0:55:44-0:55:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:55:44):**  like revisionist history.  
**[0:55:46-0:55:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:55:46):**  It's also insane.  
**[0:55:47-0:55:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:55:47):**  It also is just like something that we've accepted as, you know, oh well white people  
**[0:55:50-0:55:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:55:50):**  own all the land.  
**[0:55:51-0:55:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:55:51):**  So I guess white people have to be the solution and have to be the people who choose what's  
**[0:55:55-0:55:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:55:55):**  next.  
**[0:55:56-0:56:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:55:56):**  And that is just, if anyone has a claim to being a successful long-term agriculturalist  
**[0:56:01-0:56:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:56:01):**  in the Americas, it goes indigenous people and then black people and then Asian people  
**[0:56:07-0:56:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:56:07):**  and then literally white people have never been good at it.  
**[0:56:11-0:56:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:56:11):**  We've never done it successfully for a long period of time.  
**[0:56:14-0:56:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:56:14):**  We've spent the last like two to 400 years.  
**[0:56:17-0:56:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:56:17):**  Extractive.  
**[0:56:18-0:56:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:56:18):**  Yeah.  
**[0:56:19-0:56:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:56:19):**  Advancing technology to lengthen the time period that extraction can continue.  
**[0:56:22-0:56:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:56:22):**  To slow down.  
**[0:56:23-0:56:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:56:23):**  Yeah.  
**[0:56:24-0:56:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:56:24):**  And so would you spend some of it on lobbying, like on the policy side of things?  
**[0:56:28-0:56:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:56:28):**  You could quote you call it an investment, that's a separate discussion, but would you  
**[0:56:32-0:56:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:56:32):**  like bring some of it, let's say home to where you're now in Washington and try to take on  
**[0:56:36-0:56:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:56:36):**  the tax part, take on all of the other things?  
**[0:56:40-0:56:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:56:40):**  Yeah.  
**[0:56:41-0:56:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:56:41):**  So I don't think I could argue that there would be an investment or a return on investment  
**[0:56:45-0:56:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:56:45):**  for that.  
**[0:56:46-0:56:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:56:46):**  But if your return is just like more regenerative act, yes, totally.  
**[0:56:50-0:56:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:56:50):**  So on the land tax exemption side, which is some of the worst stuff we've seen, like,  
**[0:56:57-0:57:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:56:57):**  you know, for example, Donald Trump got $80,000 off of his tax for a golf course in New Jersey  
**[0:57:02-0:57:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:57:02):**  because he like basically mowed the lawn there and called it hanging and then got out of  
**[0:57:07-0:57:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:57:07):**  paying his land taxes because in New Jersey, you only have to have $500 in sales or like  
**[0:57:12-0:57:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:57:12):**  five acres to count as a farm and then get like 90% tax credit.  
**[0:57:17-0:57:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:57:17):**  So that unfortunately would have to be state by state to deal with.  
**[0:57:21-0:57:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:57:21):**  And there is a lot of strong advocates against it, basically because the argument is like  
**[0:57:24-0:57:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:57:24):**  if you don't have a tax, ag land tax exemption, then it'll all just get developed immediately,  
**[0:57:28-0:57:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:57:28):**  which is just blatantly not true.  
**[0:57:31-0:57:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:57:31):**  But also there is like some weird development pressure there.  
**[0:57:35-0:57:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:57:35):**  So you'd have to have a thoughtful strategy around doing that that I don't know if anyone  
**[0:57:38-0:57:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:57:38):**  has tried to put together basically because nobody likes to make rich people mad in America.  
**[0:57:44-0:57:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:57:44):**  And then on the other hand, I think there is some very easy like I am shocked that there  
**[0:57:50-0:57:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:57:50):**  hasn't been more coordination around.  
**[0:57:54-0:57:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:57:54):**  There are so many common parties who could push against the way that our ag subsidy system  
**[0:57:59-0:58:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:57:59):**  currently works from like, you know, like food, hunger people, hunger advocates.  
**[0:58:03-0:58:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:58:03):**  They should be getting the money that's going to farmers.  
**[0:58:06-0:58:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:58:06):**  If like the point of the farm bill is to make sure Americans don't starve to death, then  
**[0:58:09-0:58:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:58:09):**  farmers should not be getting that money.  
**[0:58:11-0:58:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:58:11):**  Food banks should be getting them probably, or we should just regulate companies to pay  
**[0:58:14-0:58:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:58:14):**  a living wage would be another option.  
**[0:58:16-0:58:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:58:16):**  But we don't want to do that either.  
**[0:58:17-0:58:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:58:17):**  You know, like the far super capitalist purists hate the farm bill because it's all subsidization  
**[0:58:24-0:58:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:58:24):**  and market distorting, which like, great, I'll take an ally where you can get one.  
**[0:58:29-0:58:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:58:29):**  Environmentalists, obviously, we've very unfortunately seen a lot of environmental groups in the  
**[0:58:33-0:58:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:58:33):**  US like just get on board with conventional ag and just say like, we'd rather work with  
**[0:58:38-0:58:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:58:38):**  them than not work with them.  
**[0:58:40-0:58:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:58:40):**  Just sort of the impact investing argument of let's not divest from some of the impact  
**[0:58:44-0:58:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:58:44):**  investment, I'm not saying, but let's not divest from fossil fuel companies because  
**[0:58:48-0:58:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:58:48):**  we can have a dialogue.  
**[0:58:49-0:58:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:58:49):**  And I think there are very strong arguments that that doesn't work, even though your proxy  
**[0:58:52-0:58:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:58:52):**  vote and all of that, I mean, they don't really care.  
**[0:58:55-0:58:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:58:55):**  And divest is starting to scare them and or the new businesses around renewable energies  
**[0:58:59-0:59:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:58:59):**  are starting to scare them more.  
**[0:59:01-0:59:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:59:01):**  So I think let's focus our energy on the new businesses instead of trying to transform  
**[0:59:05-0:59:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:59:05):**  an old one anyway.  
**[0:59:06-0:59:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:59:06):**  Yeah.  
**[0:59:07-0:59:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:59:07):**  And I think the easiest place, the easiest in road to address what's going on in agriculture  
**[0:59:12-0:59:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:59:12):**  and to change the policy is just around the basic farm bill risk management payments.  
**[0:59:17-0:59:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:59:17):**  Yeah.  
**[0:59:18-0:59:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:59:18):**  Right.  
**[0:59:19-0:59:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:59:19):**  Because I think people don't understand that between subsidized crop insurance and revenue  
**[0:59:23-0:59:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:59:23):**  protection risk management programs, you're insured against both bad weather and bad prices.  
**[0:59:29-0:59:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:59:29):**  Those two things are inverses.  
**[0:59:31-0:59:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:59:31):**  When there's bad weather, there's good prices because there's not a lot of stuff.  
**[0:59:34-0:59:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:59:34):**  And when there's bad weather, there's good prices because there is a lot of stuff.  
**[0:59:37-0:59:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:59:37):**  So when you're insured against every eventuality, that's not insurance anymore.  
**[0:59:42-0:59:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:59:42):**  It's guaranteed basic income.  
**[0:59:44-0:59:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:59:44):**  If we're going to have a guaranteed basic income for anyone in America, is it going  
**[0:59:47-0:59:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:59:47):**  to be for the two million people who own three trillion dollars worth of land?  
**[0:59:51-0:59:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:59:51):**  I think there's like a real conversation that could be had there that like is not very controversial.  
**[0:59:56-1:00:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=0:59:56):**  That's just like, hey, do we want to give rich people these direct payments or would  
**[1:00:01-1:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:00:01):**  we like that money to go literally anywhere else?  
**[1:00:05-1:00:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:00:05):**  Or at the very least, could we attach, should there be some strings attached to getting  
**[1:00:08-1:00:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:00:08):**  this money?  
**[1:00:09-1:00:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:00:09):**  Because rather than paying farmers for conservation practices, you have to do conservation practices  
**[1:00:13-1:00:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:00:13):**  to get this money to get anything.  
**[1:00:15-1:00:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:00:15):**  Yeah.  
**[1:00:16-1:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:00:16):**  And one other quick thing, which I think is super hopeful to me and really interesting  
**[1:00:19-1:00:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:00:19):**  is that there actually are some really interesting ag law folks in the United States who are  
**[1:00:23-1:00:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:00:23):**  looking really hard at basically doing something that looks like tenant laws in farmland in  
**[1:00:30-1:00:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:00:30):**  the United States.  
**[1:00:31-1:00:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:00:31):**  So like I live in an apartment building.  
**[1:00:34-1:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:00:34):**  The apartment owner is not allowed to rent me an apartment that's not fit to live in.  
**[1:00:38-1:00:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:00:38):**  It has to have running water.  
**[1:00:39-1:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:00:39):**  It has to have like a toilet and a shower and it has to like not give me cancer or like  
**[1:00:44-1:00:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:00:44):**  the roof is not allowed to fall in on me.  
**[1:00:46-1:00:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:00:46):**  There's lots of arguments in agriculture that you can't possibly regulate the quality of  
**[1:00:50-1:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:00:50):**  farmland, but because then no one would buy it, I guess is the argument.  
**[1:00:54-1:00:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:00:54):**  Because like if it's not a perfect money making investment, then like people won't be interested.  
**[1:00:59-1:01:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:00:59):**  The thing is, in real estate, it works like that.  
**[1:01:02-1:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:01:02):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[1:01:03-1:01:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:01:03):**  Like I live in Washington, D.C. and it's not hard to see that people are clearly making  
**[1:01:07-1:01:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:01:07):**  money off of renting apartments.  
**[1:01:10-1:01:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:01:10):**  And so I don't actually think that's a good argument.  
**[1:01:12-1:01:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:01:12):**  And there's people who are working on the idea of having a required minimum quality  
**[1:01:17-1:01:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:01:17):**  for farmland to be able to rent it.  
**[1:01:20-1:01:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:01:20):**  And actually, we also do that for ownership, right?  
**[1:01:22-1:01:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:01:22):**  A private building can be condemned if you don't keep it up, which basically is like  
**[1:01:25-1:01:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:01:25):**  a type of repossession by like the government or something.  
**[1:01:29-1:01:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:01:29):**  So the idea that there is legal things happening to say you can't just degrade your land into  
**[1:01:37-1:01:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:01:37):**  oblivion.  
**[1:01:38-1:01:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:01:38):**  Like, there is actually requirements.  
**[1:01:39-1:01:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:01:39):**  Your land is part of a system that is part of a public system that we pay for as a country  
**[1:01:44-1:01:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:01:44):**  and hold collectively at some level.  
**[1:01:46-1:01:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:01:46):**  So yeah, no, you can't just like burn it all down.  
**[1:01:49-1:01:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:01:49):**  You're not free to do that.  
**[1:01:50-1:01:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:01:50):**  We don't live in a society where that's OK.  
**[1:01:53-1:01:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:01:53):**  So holding people to, you know, that would fundamentally transform what it means to be  
**[1:01:57-1:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:01:57):**  a tenant farmer, because then, yeah, you wouldn't be paying for improving your landlord's property.  
**[1:02:03-1:02:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:02:03):**  Your landlord would pay you for that.  
**[1:02:05-1:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:02:05):**  Like my building employs a guy who does maintenance in the building.  
**[1:02:09-1:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:02:09):**  That doesn't make this apartment building not work financially.  
**[1:02:13-1:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:02:13):**  It actually helps it work much better.  
**[1:02:15-1:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:02:15):**  So, you know, the idea that we would have actual maintenance happening on farmland,  
**[1:02:20-1:02:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:02:20):**  improve the quality, actually invest in like the professional skill of farming and farmland,  
**[1:02:24-1:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:02:24):**  you know, maintenance.  
**[1:02:25-1:02:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:02:25):**  I think there's other ways besides just changing farm bill policy to do that.  
**[1:02:29-1:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:02:29):**  I think there's potentially legal routes.  
**[1:02:30-1:02:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:02:30):**  I think however much I'm a deeply impatient person and passionate about that future, I  
**[1:02:35-1:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:02:35):**  think it's probably pretty far off.  
**[1:02:37-1:02:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:02:37):**  So we took away your fund, unfortunately, but you have a magic wand.  
**[1:02:41-1:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:02:41):**  You can change one thing in the ag and food system.  
**[1:02:44-1:02:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:02:44):**  What would that be or industry or whatever you want to call it?  
**[1:02:47-1:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:02:47):**  No question.  
**[1:02:49-1:02:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:02:49):**  Enforce all the existing laws because we basically don't.  
**[1:02:52-1:02:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:02:52):**  We basically don't enforce any environmental laws on farms.  
**[1:02:55-1:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:02:55):**  We basically enforce like almost no labor laws on farms.  
**[1:02:58-1:03:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:02:58):**  If there was just a serious enforcement mechanism for, I mean, right.  
**[1:03:03-1:03:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:03:03):**  I don't know a farmer who hasn't sprayed a pesticide off label.  
**[1:03:06-1:03:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:03:06):**  That's illegal to do, but they just don't care.  
**[1:03:09-1:03:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:03:09):**  No one enforces it.  
**[1:03:10-1:03:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:03:10):**  No one ever checks.  
**[1:03:11-1:03:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:03:11):**  You know, at this point, I don't know a farmer who thinks that the organic certification  
**[1:03:15-1:03:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:03:15):**  is enforced.  
**[1:03:16-1:03:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:03:16):**  I just talked to a farmer who just got his organic certification renewed not too long  
**[1:03:20-1:03:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:03:20):**  ago.  
**[1:03:21-1:03:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:03:21):**  It was literally just like a guy drove onto his farm, handed him his certificate through  
**[1:03:24-1:03:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:03:24):**  the truck window and drove away.  
**[1:03:25-1:03:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:03:25):**  Like that's organic certification.  
**[1:03:28-1:03:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:03:28):**  So just like any oversight, you know, give enforcement to EPA to regulate pollution,  
**[1:03:35-1:03:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:03:35):**  give enforcement to the Department of Labor to regulate how workers are treated, how workers  
**[1:03:38-1:03:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:03:38):**  are housed, how workers are paid, remove all the exemptions from small family farms and  
**[1:03:43-1:03:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:03:43):**  just say like you're a business and we have expectations for how businesses treat public  
**[1:03:48-1:03:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:03:48):**  resources, customers and employees.  
**[1:03:52-1:03:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:03:52):**  And now you're going to start acting like it.  
**[1:03:54-1:03:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:03:54):**  I think that would be transformative.  
**[1:03:56-1:03:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:03:56):**  Act like a business.  
**[1:03:57-1:04:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:03:57):**  I want to thank you so much for your time.

**[1:05:44-1:05:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:05:44):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[1:05:46-1:05:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:05:46):**  After a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of audio asking the question  
**[1:05:50-1:05:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:05:50):**  how to put money to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011  
**[1:05:55-1:06:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:05:55):**  and recording these podcasts since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  
**[1:06:00-1:06:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:06:00):**  What have we seen in the space over the last years?

**[1:06:23-1:06:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:06:23):**  The soil builders, people working in this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers,  
**[1:06:28-1:06:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:06:28):**  vehicle builders, crowd investing, platform builders, ag tech companies, farm to gut food  
**[1:06:32-1:06:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:06:32):**  companies, permaculture, key line designers, holistic management consultants, etc.  
**[1:06:37-1:06:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:06:37):**  People that are building soil at scale.  
**[1:06:40-1:06:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:06:40):**  And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office  
**[1:06:43-1:06:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:06:43):**  or as private individuals or people who are putting other people's money to work through

**[1:06:54-1:06:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:06:54):**  No.  
**[1:06:55-1:06:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:06:55):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[1:06:57-1:07:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:06:57):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you and I'm very aware  
**[1:07:02-1:07:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:07:02):**  that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very different means.  
**[1:07:07-1:07:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:07:07):**  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[1:07:12-1:07:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:07:12):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[1:07:14-1:07:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:07:14):**  Thank you.  
**[1:07:15-1:07:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:07:15):**  So what is this course?  
**[1:07:17-1:07:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:07:17):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  
**[1:07:23-1:07:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:07:23):**  so you don't have to ride along.  
**[1:07:25-1:07:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:07:25):**  We're gonna look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[1:07:30-1:07:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:07:30):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[1:07:35-1:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:07:35):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[1:07:40-1:07:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:07:40):**  if you're a soil builder.  
**[1:07:42-1:07:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:07:42):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[1:07:47-1:07:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:07:47):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[1:07:51-1:07:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:07:51):**  We're gonna look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[1:07:55-1:07:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:07:55):**  So what is it not?  
**[1:07:56-1:07:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:07:56):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[1:07:58-1:08:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:07:58):**  Unfortunately, that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[1:08:01-1:08:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:08:01):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[1:08:04-1:08:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:08:04):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[1:08:06-1:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:08:06):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.  
**[1:08:12-1:08:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-mock#t=1:08:12):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking.

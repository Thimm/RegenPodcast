**[0:00:09-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:00:09):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture investing as if the planet mattered  
**[0:00:14-0:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:00:14):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:19-0:00:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:00:19):**  To learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil people local communities and ecosystems  
**[0:00:26-0:00:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:00:26):**  while making an appropriate and fair return  
**[0:00:28-0:00:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:00:28):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration because so many of the pressing issues we face today  
**[0:00:33-0:00:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:00:33):**  have their roots in how we treat our land grow our food and what we eat and it's time that we as investors  
**[0:00:39-0:00:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:00:39):**  big and small and consumers start paying much more attention to the dirt soil underneath our feet  
**[0:00:46-0:00:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:00:46):**  Before we get started I've been recording these interviews next to my day job and I will definitely  
**[0:00:51-0:00:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:00:51):**  continue to do so and release about an episode a month but at the same time I would love to take  
**[0:00:56-0:01:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:00:56):**  this further share more interviews there are many more stories to share on investing in regenerative  
**[0:01:01-0:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:01:01):**  food and agriculture more depth improve the quality maybe even doing some video series  
**[0:01:07-0:01:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:01:07):**  So I started a patreon community which makes it easy to support creators like myself if these

**[0:01:22-0:01:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:01:22):**  And now without further ado the interview. Enjoy!  
**[0:01:52-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:01:52):**  There was one particular moment or one particular event that somehow pushed me to think even more  
**[0:02:12-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:02:12):**  about it that was actually an employee of mine so I found it also one company in the organic food  
**[0:02:19-0:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:02:19):**  sector and organic food for children and my co-founder and I we always told everybody  
**[0:02:26-0:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:02:26):**  ourselves our families but also our employees well we're all getting up every morning to get  
**[0:02:31-0:02:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:02:31):**  children excited for good and healthy food that's the reason you know that's why we're working here  
**[0:02:36-0:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:02:36):**  and one day one of the employees of of us came to us and said wait a minute is that actually true  
**[0:02:44-0:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:02:44):**  are we actually working for that purpose or aren't we actually working for you both because you can  
**[0:02:50-0:02:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:02:50):**  monetize it you can sell it you can pass it on to your children they can monetize it etc are we  
**[0:02:56-0:03:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:02:56):**  actually working for your wealth and that was kind of a provocative question but we realized legally  
**[0:03:08-0:03:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:03:08):**  and she was right and so and I realized you know without intending it without wanting it  
**[0:03:16-0:03:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:03:16):**  I had set up a legal entity that would somehow serve my wealth so that that somehow felt strange  
**[0:03:23-0:03:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:03:23):**  that's when I realized oh there's something wrong I have to look for different ownership structures  
**[0:03:28-0:03:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:03:28):**  to somehow make sure that we can all work really for a purpose here and um I was very  
**[0:03:35-0:03:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:03:35):**  very happy with the fact that I was able to make a profit this year and um and that I can remain  
**[0:03:45-0:03:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:03:45):**  a steward and don't become just a normal you know shareholder and in the future an absentee owner  
**[0:03:52-0:04:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:03:52):**  who just collects profits two main principles that I became to believe that they are actually  
**[0:04:03-0:04:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:04:03):**  a self-owned and um so one thing that all of them make sure is the is self-governance so they all  
**[0:04:14-0:04:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:04:14):**  somehow make sure the majority of the voting rights the majority of the steering wheel basically  
**[0:04:20-0:04:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:04:20):**  of the company isn't a tradable commodity anymore so the steering wheel cannot be sold it cannot be  
**[0:04:26-0:04:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:04:26):**  passed on to children and the second principle besides the self-governance principle is the  
**[0:04:31-0:04:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:04:31):**  principle of purpose that all of these companies even big companies like Bosch really adhere to  
**[0:04:36-0:04:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:04:36):**  and that's yeah principle of purpose that basically says our entire endeavor our our  
**[0:04:43-0:04:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:04:43):**  company is there for a purpose and yes we need to make profits but profits are seen as a means  
**[0:04:49-0:04:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:04:49):**  to an end and not an end in itself and what does it mean concretely it means you are really  
**[0:04:55-0:04:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:04:55):**  if you make profits of course you pay back investors or you're paying even a good return  
**[0:04:59-0:05:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:04:59):**  to investors but then the rest you are reinvesting you're donating and you are capping um the upside  
**[0:05:07-0:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:05:07):**  for all stakeholders to make sure that the that there's enough money being reinvested and used  
**[0:05:12-0:05:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:05:12):**  for the purpose we often talk about impact but maybe leave it at that and things change companies  
**[0:05:21-0:05:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:05:21):**  change interest change personal situations change and and maybe at some point we find ourselves in a  
**[0:05:27-0:05:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:05:27):**  in a position where there's an offer or a lot of money on the table like in many cases or like the  
**[0:05:32-0:05:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:05:32):**  organic food movement now is being threatened by that and it's very difficult to say no to that  
**[0:05:37-0:05:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:05:37):**  when there's a huge huge offer on the table but when there's we maybe forgot to make the  
**[0:05:42-0:05:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:05:42):**  logical next step to actually make it a legal legally binding agreement to not change the  
**[0:05:48-0:05:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:05:48):**  mission and and unless you have that there are only very few people that say no to  
**[0:05:53-0:05:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:05:53):**  i don't know how many pensions and their children's pensions and who's to blame if somebody offers 200  
**[0:05:58-0:06:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:05:58):**  million or 50 million or whatever the number is for your company that you and or your colleagues  
**[0:06:04-0:06:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:06:04):**  work for so long the problem is it goes to one family  
**[0:06:10-0:06:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:06:10):**  i would say our human psyche is not built to resist to that kind of 100 200 million  
**[0:06:19-0:06:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:06:19):**  200 million and offers especially one industry is currently under attack and that's of course the  
**[0:06:31-0:06:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:06:31):**  industry you're also working in the organic food industry in the agriculture industry  
**[0:06:36-0:06:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:06:36):**  with all the pioneers who really wanted to change the world and now for years nobody was interested  
**[0:06:43-0:06:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:06:43):**  in their companies and now suddenly everybody becomes interested and wants to buy them  
**[0:06:48-0:06:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:06:48):**  and one good example there is organically grown company ogc in the u.s portland oregon that's the  
**[0:06:56-0:07:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:06:56):**  second largest organic produce wholesaler in the u.s i think and with well only 200 million in  
**[0:07:06-0:07:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:07:06):**  revenue and 200 employees they were founded as a co-op by farmers already 30 years ago and and  
**[0:07:14-0:07:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:07:14):**  and that's when they realized oh damn you know we're in a very dangerous situation around us  
**[0:07:19-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:07:19):**  all of the you know organic pioneers are bought up by you know seven generations was bought up  
**[0:07:27-0:07:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:07:27):**  you know that whole foods was bought by amazon etc we have to change something and and they looked  
**[0:07:32-0:07:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:07:32):**  around said okay we want to actually set up something like student ownership and what they  
**[0:07:36-0:07:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:07:36):**  found is a very very unknown structure it's a perpetual purpose trust that means it's a trust  
**[0:07:45-0:07:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:07:45):**  that um unlike all other trusts doesn't have any beneficiaries any natural persons as beneficiaries  
**[0:07:53-0:08:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:07:53):**  but it has a purpose in that case it's organic agriculture as the purpose and it's perpetual so  
**[0:08:00-0:08:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:08:00):**  it doesn't end and um they set this up and now the question was how can we get the company in there  
**[0:08:06-0:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:08:06):**  and that's when they needed uh they needed financing and also a new kind of financing they  
**[0:08:11-0:08:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:08:11):**  needed basically alternative buyout capital alternative private equity and capital in order  
**[0:08:20-0:08:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:08:20):**  to buy out some of the old investors and that's when we went in there and we negotiated with them  
**[0:08:26-0:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:08:26):**  probably the most impactful would be to have a law that basically makes farmland  
**[0:08:37-0:08:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:08:37):**  steward owned in that sense so everything that i was talking about companies now that for land  
**[0:08:45-0:08:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:08:45):**  they are not asking what i would call the power question because steward ownership is asking the  
**[0:08:51-0:08:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:08:51):**  power question who has the power in our companies who has the power in organizations we're all  
**[0:08:56-0:09:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:08:56):**  spending most of our times in are these people who can buy the power so is this money it's the  
**[0:09:01-0:09:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:09:01):**  principle of money or are these people who just um by chance inherit the power is this the principle  
**[0:09:09-0:09:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:09:09):**  of blood or do we have another principle a principle of purpose or stewardship that someone  
**[0:09:14-0:09:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:09:14):**  makes sure they're always people and that are able and values aligned able ability and value  
**[0:09:21-0:09:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:09:21):**  relatives so a different kind of family so to say so to speak um that are getting the power there  
**[0:09:28-0:09:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:09:28):**  and that's that's deep power question just listen to the summary of the interview for the full-length

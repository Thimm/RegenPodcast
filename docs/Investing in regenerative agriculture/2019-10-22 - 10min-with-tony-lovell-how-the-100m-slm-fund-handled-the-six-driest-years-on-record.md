### Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food  (Tue, 22 Oct 2019 16:30:52)
## 10min with Tony Lovell, how the $ 100M SLM fund handled the six driest years on record  
**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:00:00):**  You're listening to the summary of the interview. For a link to the full length episode, please check the description below.  
**[0:00:09-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:00:09):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture investing as if the planet mattered  
**[0:00:14-0:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:00:14):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:19-0:00:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:00:19):**  To learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil people local communities and ecosystems  
**[0:00:26-0:00:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:00:26):**  while making an appropriate and fair return  
**[0:00:28-0:00:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:00:28):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration because so many of the pressing issues we face today  
**[0:00:33-0:00:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:00:33):**  have their roots in how we treat our land grow our food and what we eat and it's time that we as investors  
**[0:00:39-0:00:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:00:39):**  big and small and consumers start paying much more attention to the dirt soil underneath our feet  
**[0:00:46-0:00:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:00:46):**  Before we get started I've been recording these interviews next to my day job and I will definitely  
**[0:00:51-0:00:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:00:51):**  continue to do so and release about an episode a month but at the same time I would love to take  
**[0:00:56-0:01:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:00:56):**  this further share more interviews there are many more stories to share on investing in regenerative  
**[0:01:01-0:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:01:01):**  food and agriculture more depth improve the quality maybe even doing some video series  
**[0:01:07-0:01:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:01:07):**  So I started a patreon community which makes it easy to support creators like myself if these  
**[0:01:12-0:01:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:01:12):**  podcasts have been of value to you and if you have the means I invite you to support me and make this  
**[0:01:18-0:01:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:01:18):**  happen for more information please find the link to my patreon account in the description below  
**[0:01:22-0:01:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:01:22):**  And now without further ado the interview. Enjoy!  
**[0:01:28-0:01:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:01:28):**  SLM partners was SLM stands for Sustainable Land Management  
**[0:01:33-0:01:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:01:33):**  So we started in 2012 raised 75 million dollars from a Danish pension fund  
**[0:01:40-0:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:01:40):**  another 30 million dollars worth of finance from an international bank Rabobank  
**[0:01:46-0:01:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:01:46):**  incredibly supportive agricultural bank both of those groups are very  
**[0:01:49-0:01:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:01:49):**  very supportive of the agriculture what we did was we acquired large areas of what we described  
**[0:01:58-0:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:01:58):**  as inherently good quality country that have been degraded by inappropriate management unintentional  
**[0:02:03-0:02:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:02:03):**  but inappropriate management and as a result of 150 years of set stocking in a seasonally dry  
**[0:02:10-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:02:10):**  erratic rainfall and ecosystem productivity production performance biodiversity every  
**[0:02:17-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:02:17):**  thing had gone south had reduced so the intention was to acquire that property spend money on  
**[0:02:25-0:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:02:25):**  infrastructure water fencing upgrades and then change the grazing management with the intention  
**[0:02:31-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:02:31):**  to over the life of the fund a 10 to 15 year fund double carrying capacity halve cost of production  
**[0:02:37-0:02:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:02:37):**  and be a large scale low cost producer of high quality grass fed protein that was the project  
**[0:02:43-0:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:02:43):**  fund the project thesis and it remains a project thesis we also said that we would as the  
**[0:02:50-0:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:02:50):**  opportunities arose monetize I don't like the term but ecosystem services so carbon offsets  
**[0:02:58-0:03:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:02:58):**  water and air quality offsets whatever came available biodiversity credits and we've been  
**[0:03:03-0:03:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:03:03):**  able to do that as well so that's the basic thesis of the fund a very simple process buy the land  
**[0:03:08-0:03:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:03:08):**  do the infrastructure change the management and allow nature to recover and bring back the  
**[0:03:14-0:03:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:03:14):**  productivity that land inherently is is capable of okay well the total amount of land that we have  
**[0:03:23-0:03:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:03:23):**  in in the fund itself is 480 000 hectares actively developed with water and fencing and the  
**[0:03:31-0:03:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:03:31):**  infrastructures is about half of that 220 240 000 hectares and the other 200 000 hectares is large  
**[0:03:40-0:03:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:03:40):**  scale in Australia Mulga is a leguminous native tree and it's a carbon project  
**[0:03:49-0:03:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:03:49):**  the land that we've got is in terms of holistic management talk is um brittle tending so it's  
**[0:03:56-0:04:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:03:56):**  erratic and unreliable rainfall patterns long-term averages long-term average rainfall for the  
**[0:04:02-0:04:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:04:02):**  country we've got is around that 375 mill millimeters a year but that can vary widely  
**[0:04:09-0:04:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:04:09):**  we bought in 2012 off the back of two very good seasons our country also gets beneficial flooding  
**[0:04:16-0:04:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:04:16):**  so we'd had two very good seasons unfortunately with conventional management that's a very  
**[0:04:22-0:04:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:04:22):**  good season unfortunately with conventional management that the benefit that we should  
**[0:04:29-0:04:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:04:29):**  have received from that was pretty much ephemeral and didn't really run through  
**[0:04:36-0:04:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:04:36):**  so we then ran into six of the driest years on record what that means is the first year is tough  
**[0:04:45-0:04:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:04:45):**  the second year compounds off that keep going forward five or six and it gets pretty challenging  
**[0:04:50-0:04:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:04:50):**  and the decision we made was and I don't describe it as de-stocking and one of the things that we do  
**[0:04:57-0:05:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:04:57):**  I think is critically important is we match our stocking rates to our carrying capacity  
**[0:05:06-0:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:05:06):**  we have probably in the last three to six months actually had some reasonable rain we had between  
**[0:05:12-0:05:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:05:12):**  90 and 130 mils we are still a long way short of where we we would like to be on a long-term  
**[0:05:19-0:05:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:05:19):**  average basis but that was combined with some beneficial flooding as we speak on the land that  
**[0:05:27-0:05:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:05:27):**  we've got that received the beneficial flooding we are back up to just shy of 5 000 cattle  
**[0:05:36-0:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:05:36):**  so on the ground the interesting thing has been the staff our team have been very positive the  
**[0:05:43-0:05:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:05:43):**  whole way through because they can see the benefits of the decisions we're making they  
**[0:05:48-0:05:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:05:48):**  can see that playing out on the land and especially after we did get the rain event  
**[0:05:53-0:05:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:05:53):**  and the flooding that came through it is noticeable the difference in response of our  
**[0:05:59-0:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:05:59):**  country managed appropriately or managed the way that we consider to be the correct way to manage  
**[0:06:03-0:06:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:06:03):**  it compared to conventionally managed country over the fence on our neighbour's properties  
**[0:06:10-0:06:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:06:10):**  the interesting thing is on on the land itself and I probably somewhat facetiously described it to  
**[0:06:17-0:06:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:06:17):**  some of the people who were asking about how we were going some of the neighbours I said  
**[0:06:21-0:06:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:06:21):**  the way I describe it is we're going broke slower than anybody else we weren't making money because  
**[0:06:26-0:06:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:06:26):**  we had no stock obviously but because we weren't feeding and we weren't degrading our ecosystem  
**[0:06:36-0:06:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:06:36):**  we were holding our own and we were actually in a position that when the rain did come  
**[0:06:41-0:06:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:06:41):**  the very interesting observation from several of our managers and you could see it on the land was  
**[0:06:47-0:06:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:06:47):**  that our land had far less runoff so this is land that has been passed and desperately looking for  
**[0:06:53-0:07:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:06:53):**  rain for five or six years and when the rain event did turn up the amount of land that rejected that  
**[0:07:00-0:07:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:07:00):**  rain was terrifyingly disheartening it was just shocking that you know nice steady gentle rain  
**[0:07:07-0:07:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:07:07):**  but it ran off because the land had been so degraded that it was unable to accept that rain  
**[0:07:12-0:07:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:07:12):**  when it did arrive we had very little runoff in our country which means that what we did was we  
**[0:07:17-0:07:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:07:17):**  got the benefit of the moisture when it did turn up that will take time to build on that again and  
**[0:07:23-0:07:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:07:23):**  again but you start to build an ecosystem that actually accepts the moisture when it's available  
**[0:07:30-0:07:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:07:30):**  whereas in a lot of cases a lot of these seasonally dry ecosystems have been so degraded  
**[0:07:36-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:07:36):**  they actually reject the thing that they most desperately need when nature does provide it  
**[0:07:40-0:07:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:07:40):**  which is fairly perverse but unfortunate reality  
**[0:07:48-0:07:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:07:48):**  I think that the gap you've got is between a project size that makes sense from a third-party  
**[0:07:58-0:08:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:07:58):**  manager like an SLM to run where you have to have a certain amount of capital involved to be able to  
**[0:08:03-0:08:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:08:03):**  generate enough fees to be able to pay for the people that need to be there to run the project  
**[0:08:08-0:08:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:08:08):**  so there's a certain minimum size and how you balance that minimum size up with a project that  
**[0:08:14-0:08:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:08:14):**  makes sense with the requirement for the larger institutions to have to be able to deploy their  
**[0:08:20-0:08:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:08:20):**  capital in big chunks so some of these multi-billion dollar institutions pension funds and  
**[0:08:30-0:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:08:30):**  sovereign wealth funds etc want to be able to write a single ticket of 100 million dollars  
**[0:08:36-0:08:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:08:36):**  or 500 million dollars but they don't want to be the only investors which means they're looking for  
**[0:08:44-0:08:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:08:44):**  investable products that's 250 to 500 to a billion dollars  
**[0:08:50-0:08:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:08:50):**  which is pretty hard to make sense of in the regenerative space  
**[0:08:56-0:09:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:08:56):**  the biggest constraint is probably the gap that you've got is somebody coming into investing in  
**[0:09:03-0:09:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:09:03):**  regenerative ag there is a transition period so for an investor to come into the program what  
**[0:09:12-0:09:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:09:12):**  they've got to do is really have a reporting time frame they've got to have an overall picture  
**[0:09:18-0:09:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:09:18):**  that's at least a 15-year investment horizon so when they start they're in for 15 years  
**[0:09:24-0:09:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:09:24):**  and they probably need to look at it in year five and year 10 and not worry about in the middle  
**[0:09:28-0:09:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/08/27/tony-lovell-2/#t=0:09:28):**  so

**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:00:14):**  How can we deploy billions in restoring ecosystems, increasing biodiversity and storing a lot  
**[0:00:19-0:00:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:00:19):**  of carbon permanently?  
**[0:00:20-0:00:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:00:20):**  Reforestation, agroforestry, biochar and enhanced weathering might do the trick.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:00:25):**  And it all starts in Scotland.  
**[0:00:29-0:00:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:00:29):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:00:33):**  Investing as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:35-0:00:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:00:35):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:39-0:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:00:39):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:00:44-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:00:44):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:49-0:00:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:00:49):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:51-0:00:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:00:51):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:00:55-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:00:55):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:00:58-0:01:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:00:58):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much  
**[0:01:02-0:01:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:01:02):**  more attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:01:07):**  In March last year, we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support  
**[0:01:11-0:01:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:01:11):**  our work.  
**[0:01:12-0:01:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:01:12):**  And so many of you have joined as a member.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:01:14):**  We've launched different types of benefits, exclusive content, Q&A webinars with former

**[0:01:31-0:01:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:01:31):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:32-0:01:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:01:32):**  So welcome to another episode today with the founder of the future forest company, Jim  
**[0:01:38-0:01:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:01:38):**  Mann.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:01:39):**  Welcome, Jim.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:01:40):**  Hi, how are you doing?  
**[0:01:41-0:01:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:01:41):**  I'm very well.  
**[0:01:42-0:01:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:01:42):**  And I am very excited for this interview.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:01:43):**  I think we've been in touch for many, many months.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:01:46):**  I mean, a lot of things happened in our personal lives that led to a slower than usual probably  
**[0:01:51-0:01:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:01:51):**  recording of this.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:01:52):**  I'm very excited for this.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:01:53):**  We're at the end of June 2021 and I'm very excited for this recording, but I want to  
**[0:01:57-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:01:57):**  start a bit with your background story.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:02:00):**  Why did you end up building the future forest company or why did you end up building a forest  
**[0:02:05-0:02:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:02:05):**  company focusing on soil focus on regeneration?  
**[0:02:08-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:02:08):**  Because it's not where, let's say, you spend most of your working life.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:02:12):**  No, but it does take me back to my roots.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:02:14):**  So originally, well, I grew up on a dairy farm in the north of England.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:02:19):**  Then I went to study ecology at university and that's kind of where I went off track,  
**[0:02:23-0:02:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:02:23):**  I guess.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:02:24):**  I set up my first business to pay.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:02:26):**  How does that always happen?  
**[0:02:27-0:02:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:02:27):**  Like I've heard that story many times.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:02:29):**  I grew up on a farm where I was a lot in nature.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:02:31):**  I went studying something very connected to that.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:02:34):**  And then it didn't, like I didn't, didn't happen.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:02:36):**  There are not enough jobs.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:02:37):**  So what's the point there?  
**[0:02:38-0:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:02:38):**  Well, there weren't then.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:02:39):**  I mean, I guess it's probably fortunate because the jobs then were testing water for waterboards.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:02:44):**  You know, the ecologists didn't really, you know, a very small cohort.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:02:47):**  There were, I think, 19 people who specialized in ecology at my university or in my year.  
**[0:02:53-0:02:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:02:53):**  And there weren't great job prospects for it.  
**[0:02:55-0:03:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:02:55):**  I doubt if more than two of them have actually ended up as ecologists back then.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:03:01):**  Probably in this case better, I would say.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:03:02):**  In your case, definitely better.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:03:04):**  It's given me a different background that I can then apply, I think.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:03:07):**  So yeah, I think it was probably fortuitous.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:03:10):**  But I then set up my first business to pay my way through university.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:03:14):**  And that led me down a business track rather than using the ecology.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:03:18):**  So I have an ecology degree that I hadn't used for many years, 15, 20 years.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:03:24):**  I knew about climate change quite early on.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:03:26):**  So I was well educated in what was happening.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:03:29):**  But I was also confident that governments would sort that because that's really government's  
**[0:03:35-0:03:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:03:35):**  job.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:03:36):**  And as you watch that over 15 years and see that nothing's happening, then you start to  
**[0:03:41-0:03:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:03:41):**  think that maybe actually there's other ways to do it, and that's where I ended up five  
**[0:03:45-0:03:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:03:45):**  years ago with a good income, not needing to actually go to work for that income so  
**[0:03:50-0:03:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:03:50):**  that I could sort of spend time unpaid really figuring out what I wanted to be doing and  
**[0:03:56-0:04:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:03:56):**  combining at the time the ecology back with scaling to tackle climate change.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:04:02):**  So planting deciduous forest profitably was what I decided that I thought the world needed.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:04:08):**  And just to unpack that a bit, you said I've looked at basically governments not taking  
**[0:04:12-0:04:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:04:12):**  action over 15 and over 20 years.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:04:16):**  That's a slow process.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:04:17):**  Do you remember, like you can get very annoyed by that and then not take action because it's  
**[0:04:21-0:04:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:04:21):**  so slow.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:04:22):**  It's like basically seeing erosion happen.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:04:24):**  Like you see it happening over time, but it's not something that's in your face every day  
**[0:04:28-0:04:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:04:28):**  except when there's COP21 or COP20 or whatever.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:04:32):**  Was there a specific moment that you said, OK, now I have to do something?  
**[0:04:34-0:04:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:04:34):**  Or was it that moment where you arrived, OK, now I have the space because I have the resources  
**[0:04:38-0:04:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:04:38):**  to unpaid look at that?  
**[0:04:40-0:04:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:04:40):**  Or was it a combination of the two or just a gradual process?  
**[0:04:43-0:04:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:04:43):**  I'm always interested in these moments.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:04:44):**  Like did you see at some point the speech of a politician and you thought, OK, he or  
**[0:04:48-0:04:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:04:48):**  she is really not taking it seriously.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:04:52):**  Let's go and do something.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:04:53):**  Or was it a gradual process that led you into this?  
**[0:04:57-0:04:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:04:57):**  Very much gradual.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:04:58):**  And there's no lightbulb moment, I'm afraid.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:05:01):**  And more just you recognize it's happening.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:05:05):**  I think park that and decide that it's OK because it'll get worse and then someone will  
**[0:05:11-0:05:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:05:11):**  take action and things get worse and no one takes action and things progressively then  
**[0:05:15-0:05:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:05:15):**  get worse again and no one takes action.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:05:17):**  And eventually you start to look at or in my case, I start to look at the root cause  
**[0:05:21-0:05:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:05:21):**  of that.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:05:22):**  So why aren't these people who clearly know they've got the science?  
**[0:05:26-0:05:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:05:26):**  They've had the science for 40 years.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:05:29):**  And more, actually, if you look like the original.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:05:31):**  I saw somebody on LinkedIn posting, I think somebody in New Zealand, that it was in 1912,  
**[0:05:38-0:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:05:38):**  so more than a hundred and nine years ago, probably burning this amount of coal is going  
**[0:05:43-0:05:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:05:43):**  to heat up the planet by this amount, etc, etc.  
**[0:05:45-0:05:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:05:45):**  So there was a very clear greenhouse effect analysis already more than a hundred years  
**[0:05:49-0:05:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:05:49):**  ago.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:05:50):**  So it's not that we didn't know.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:05:51):**  But yeah, we don't and still didn't do anything.  
**[0:05:54-0:05:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:05:54):**  And we're still not acting.  
**[0:05:55-0:06:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:05:55):**  You know, you can't take a view of what's happening today as real action.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:06:00):**  It's not at the scale that the problem demands.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:06:02):**  So we're still in that cycle of whether it's denial or inaction.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:06:07):**  But if you look at political cycles, you start to realize why they're so ill-equipped to  
**[0:06:12-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:06:12):**  deal with a problem of this scale.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:06:15):**  And over these time horizons, it's going to be on someone else's watch that the real problems  
**[0:06:20-0:06:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:06:20):**  happen.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:06:21):**  And that means that they tend to focus on the economy or trivial things by comparison.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:06:28):**  And they're not well set up to actually take on something of this scale.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:06:32):**  And as some would argue, companies aren't either focused on, in many cases, short term  
**[0:06:37-0:06:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:06:37):**  results.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:06:38):**  In many cases, the market is demanding quotes.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:06:40):**  I mean, we're sending out CEOs that are making bold claims about food and agriculture, sustainability,  
**[0:06:46-0:06:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:06:46):**  etc.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:06:47):**  I'm just looking at Unilever and Danone that have been pressured on certain things.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:06:50):**  And I'm sure there are others.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:06:52):**  So you with a business background and an ecology background, obviously, decided to start a  
**[0:06:57-0:06:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:06:57):**  future forest company.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:06:59):**  In essence, a thing that is slow.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:07:01):**  How did that come about?  
**[0:07:02-0:07:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:07:02):**  Apart from the fact that it's obviously necessary, why did you choose that piece of the whole  
**[0:07:07-0:07:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:07:07):**  ecology spectrum that you could have chosen back then?  
**[0:07:10-0:07:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:07:10):**  Because we've actually got two big problems, which are firstly, climate change.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:07:15):**  And the way we view the world as an organization is that our number one goal is to tackle climate  
**[0:07:20-0:07:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:07:20):**  change to remove CO2 from the atmosphere at scale.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:07:24):**  And secondly, we look at the biodiversity crisis and restoring ecological systems, particularly  
**[0:07:31-0:07:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:07:31):**  native forests is a very good tool for that.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:07:34):**  And it could be other, you know, we talk about forests as sort of the emotional attachment  
**[0:07:38-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:07:38):**  people have is often with trees.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:07:40):**  But it could be any ecosystem that you're restoring to bring that biodiversity back.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:07:44):**  And thirdly, is profit.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:07:46):**  And I explored all different models from educating, sort of training people, would it be a training  
**[0:07:52-0:07:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:07:52):**  centre, would it be an NGO and putting pressure on to governments to actually get them to  
**[0:07:56-0:07:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:07:56):**  act.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:07:57):**  But what I felt was that there was nobody actually doing or not enough people actually  
**[0:08:02-0:08:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:08:02):**  doing.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:08:03):**  And I'm discovering that there are quite a lot of people actually doing now.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:08:05):**  Luckily.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:08:06):**  Yeah, and we need more of them, vastly more of them.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:08:09):**  But action was the point that seemed to be missing.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:08:12):**  The building something that could genuinely scale was a big gap in things.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:08:16):**  There were lots of people educating, lots of people training.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:08:20):**  And it seemed like the default in regenerative ag was people would have a farm and then teach  
**[0:08:26-0:08:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:08:26):**  to the people.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:08:27):**  And that can have impact and it takes time for a movement like that to spread.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:08:32):**  But actually having something that could be scaled and therefore could be repeatedly done  
**[0:08:39-0:08:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:08:39):**  and felt like a bigger and more important way to tackle things.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:08:44):**  So let's talk about what you are doing and what is being repeatedly done at the moment.  
**[0:08:50-0:08:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:08:50):**  What is the future forest company?  
**[0:08:52-0:08:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:08:52):**  Let's unpack that a bit.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:08:53):**  What you mentioned scale a number of times, biodiversity, native forests, I think people  
**[0:08:57-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:08:57):**  are very curious and regenerative ag, people are very curious about what you're currently  
**[0:09:02-0:09:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:09:02):**  building.  
**[0:09:03-0:09:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:09:03):**  Yes, we ended up a bit off track.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:09:04):**  And that was with the realisation having worked out how to profitably reforest.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:09:09):**  And we realised or I realised that actually there isn't enough land on the planet and  
**[0:09:14-0:09:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:09:14):**  the competition for land on this planet is too intense and causes social problems if  
**[0:09:19-0:09:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:09:19):**  you start taking land away from people.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:09:21):**  So actually realising that and that reforestation alone wasn't a solution was a key moment.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:09:28):**  So what we're now doing is we continue to reforest, we continue to restore ecosystems  
**[0:09:33-0:09:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:09:33):**  and try and minimise leakage.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:09:35):**  And I'm sure we can come on to that in more detail.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:09:38):**  But we also co-deploy biochar production and enhanced weathering.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:09:43):**  That means we can 10x the carbon removal on any piece of land without having negative  
**[0:09:48-0:09:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:09:48):**  impacts elsewhere.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:09:50):**  So you went for, let's say, the biochar and enhanced weathering.  
**[0:09:54-0:09:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:09:54):**  And let's explore that in the second.  
**[0:09:56-0:10:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:09:56):**  So what exactly means to basically 10x the potential carbon removal, which means you  
**[0:10:03-0:10:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:10:03):**  need less land to reforest.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:10:05):**  That's right.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:10:06):**  Or you store a lot more carbon.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:10:07):**  It works on both sides, obviously.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:10:09):**  So what are you doing with biochar and enhanced weathering?  
**[0:10:11-0:10:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:10:11):**  And what is enhanced weathering, first of all?  
**[0:10:13-0:10:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:10:13):**  So biochar, we're taking forestry waste.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:10:16):**  We're just getting started on that on our first site for it.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:10:20):**  So this is the brush that's left behind when trees are felled for commercial timber.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:10:24):**  And we're harvesting that to turn into biochar, which stores the carbon for a lot longer than  
**[0:10:29-0:10:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:10:29):**  if that brush is left on the forest floor, which is typically what happens.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:10:33):**  So as that brush rots over 15, 20 years, it will release most of the carbon back into  
**[0:10:39-0:10:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:10:39):**  the atmosphere, either with CO2 or methane.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:10:42):**  By fixing it through biochar process, that carbon will stay as effectively a powdered  
**[0:10:47-0:10:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:10:47):**  charcoal which we can put back into the soil where it helps improve the soil, but also  
**[0:10:53-0:10:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:10:53):**  stores the carbon for hundreds, if not thousands of years.  
**[0:10:57-0:11:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:10:57):**  Preventing the rotting and storing the carbon.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:11:00):**  The rotting is part of a natural cycle, but of course, if you start cutting the trees,  
**[0:11:05-0:11:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:11:05):**  you're increasing the amount of rotting quite exponentially.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:11:07):**  If you start also pruning them and making sure that the forest is healthy, there's a  
**[0:11:12-0:11:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:11:12):**  lot of waste I can measure.  
**[0:11:14-0:11:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:11:14):**  And when they're clear felling, which is the model with Sitka Spruce in Scotland, about  
**[0:11:19-0:11:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:11:19):**  a quarter of the biomass that's been accumulated in that area will be left on the forest floor,  
**[0:11:25-0:11:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:11:25):**  won't be extracted as timber.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:11:26):**  So it's significant volumes of timber.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:11:28):**  It's not usable timber in most cases, but it's significant amounts of biomass that you  
**[0:11:33-0:11:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:11:33):**  can then fix to prevent that release of CO2.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:11:36):**  And you get paid for it because the biochar, you can turn it into a carbon credit basically  
**[0:11:42-0:11:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:11:42):**  as the biochar is stored and hasn't been, won't rot as the timber would have.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:11:46):**  So that's a huge amount of CO2 greenhouse gases prevented to grow up in here.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:11:50):**  That's right.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:11:51):**  And that's largely our core business model is carbon credits and carbon removal.  
**[0:11:56-0:12:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:11:56):**  How's that market been because there's I think an enormous interest at the moment.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:12:01):**  I can sense an amount of cowboys entering the space as well, which is crazy.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:12:05):**  At the same time, we need it.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:12:06):**  We absolutely need a healthy carbon market.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:12:09):**  What have you seen in the space?  
**[0:12:10-0:12:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:12:10):**  And then we get to enhance weathering.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:12:12):**  Don't worry, listeners, we're getting there.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:12:13):**  But I'm very curious of, I think people already be curious that you can actually sell carbon  
**[0:12:17-0:12:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:12:17):**  credits coming from biochar.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:12:19):**  I mean, something that sounds super interesting.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:12:22):**  Well biochar is a pretty good one because you can measure it well and the permanence  
**[0:12:27-0:12:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:12:27):**  is well understood.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:12:28):**  You can measure it at tonnage.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:12:29):**  You have to, yeah, it has to go through your hands anyway, left or right.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:12:33):**  Yeah.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:12:34):**  And where I'm more skeptical is things like soil carbon, which I'm sure is a big thing  
**[0:12:39-0:12:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:12:39):**  for a lot of the audience.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:12:40):**  But the problem I have with both soil carbon and tree carbon, and we do sell tree carbon  
**[0:12:45-0:12:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:12:45):**  and soil carbon as well.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:12:46):**  But the problem I have with both of those is if you change the management practice,  
**[0:12:50-0:12:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:12:50):**  that can be reversed very quickly.  
**[0:12:53-0:12:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:12:53):**  Management practice could be as simple with the tree as the chainsaw and a match.  
**[0:12:56-0:12:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:12:56):**  And a plough.  
**[0:12:57-0:12:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:12:57):**  Yeah.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:12:58):**  And a plough for the soil, you can reverse that carbon capture very quickly.  
**[0:13:01-0:13:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:13:01):**  How do you tackle that in your sites and your operation?  
**[0:13:04-0:13:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:13:04):**  That fear, rightfully so, is there for many clients that would say, I would love to, I've  
**[0:13:08-0:13:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:13:08):**  been working on my carbon budget of my company and this is just this last, the ideal case,  
**[0:13:13-0:13:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:13:13):**  this last piece that I cannot, I need to offset it.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:13:15):**  I cannot reduce it, I need to offset it.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:13:17):**  And I'm working or I need to almost inset it.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:13:19):**  I need to work with this forest or this ecosystem.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:13:21):**  But yeah, I want to make sure that it's going to stay up also after 20 years and more, because  
**[0:13:26-0:13:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:13:26):**  we all know these examples of, yeah, of course, we paid for the trees to stay there.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:13:30):**  And then somebody changed their management practices, aka a chainsaw or a plough.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:13:34):**  Yeah.  
**[0:13:35-0:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:13:35):**  So what is the solution there that you found to make sure that that can never happen?  
**[0:13:39-0:13:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:13:39):**  So from our side, there's a couple of things.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:13:42):**  And we're very careful about where we operate.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:13:44):**  We want to operate where there is a strong rule of law and where ownership of land means  
**[0:13:49-0:13:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:13:49):**  that we've got good control over it into perpetuity so that if we plant a forest, that forest  
**[0:13:55-0:13:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:13:55):**  will be left there.  
**[0:13:56-0:14:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:13:56):**  We're not having to put armed guards around our forest to stop illegal logging or anything  
**[0:14:01-0:14:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:14:01):**  like that.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:14:02):**  And you own the land in all cases?  
**[0:14:04-0:14:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:14:04):**  We do.  
**[0:14:05-0:14:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:14:05):**  We buy the land in all cases to make sure that we have that level of ownership.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:14:08):**  It might not be that we'll always buy it going forward, but we will want to know that we  
**[0:14:12-0:14:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:14:12):**  have control over that land into a distant future.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:14:18):**  And the other things we do to try and ensure permanence are we pick the location for the  
**[0:14:25-0:14:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:14:25):**  tree planting in particular where we've got a very low risk of forest fire.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:14:30):**  If you've ever been to Scotland, you'll know that a drought here is two or three days on  
**[0:14:34-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:14:34):**  the west coast of Scotland between rainfall and the chance of a forest fire.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:14:40):**  Unfortunately, many places aren't like that.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:14:42):**  Exactly.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:14:43):**  We can all see the droughts in the huge heat waves in the US at the moment.  
**[0:14:47-0:14:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:14:47):**  And I'm sure we'll have an interesting summer in many places in Europe as well.  
**[0:14:51-0:14:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:14:51):**  So yeah, that's tricky.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:14:52):**  So we try and avoid areas where there's a high risk to our forests.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:14:58):**  The permanence on soil, again, if you've got a good rule of law and you're putting a forest  
**[0:15:03-0:15:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:15:03):**  over the top of it, that soil is pretty secure and soil carbon therefore has a higher value.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:15:10):**  So you're able to sell the soil carbon as well as the tree carbon on the same project.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:15:15):**  And then the biochar and the enhanced weathering will get to that.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:15:18):**  So it's almost four layer and you're not even talking about biodiversity yet, but that would  
**[0:15:23-0:15:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:15:23):**  be interesting as well.  
**[0:15:24-0:15:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:15:24):**  Exactly.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:15:25):**  And biodiversity is another potential area to monetize as we do this.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:15:29):**  So yeah, that's basically how we try and protect it.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:15:32):**  We're very careful about our location selection.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:15:34):**  And the enhanced weathering, what is that?  
**[0:15:36-0:15:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:15:36):**  The biochar we covered briefly.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:15:37):**  I know there's a whole world of biochar fence out there and biochar gurus, but this is a  
**[0:15:42-0:15:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:15:42):**  very interesting angle.  
**[0:15:44-0:15:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:15:44):**  It also helps the soil as I know, but what is enhanced weathering?  
**[0:15:48-0:15:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:15:48):**  So enhanced weathering is based on natural rock weathering process.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:15:53):**  Just diverting to a quick chemistry lesson, but I'll keep it lightweight for you.  
**[0:15:57-0:16:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:15:57):**  So as rainwater falls through the atmosphere, it dissolves CO2 and that leads to a weak  
**[0:16:04-0:16:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:16:04):**  carbonic acid, that carbonic acid, so all rainfall is slightly acidic as a carbonic  
**[0:16:09-0:16:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:16:09):**  acid and that will create a chemical reaction with basic rocks.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:16:13):**  So alkali rocks, which precipitates certain types of rock will then precipitate carbonates,  
**[0:16:20-0:16:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:16:20):**  which is a permanent store of the CO2.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:16:22):**  So this actually removes CO2 from the atmosphere.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:16:25):**  So certain places, rain can store CO2.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:16:28):**  That's right.  
**[0:16:29-0:16:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:16:29):**  If it hits the right rock at the right time, etc.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:16:31):**  That's it.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:16:32):**  So Scotland is like a massive carbon sink.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:16:35):**  Well it should be, but you've got to intervene if you want it to work at really big scale.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:16:38):**  Hence the enhanced piece.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:16:41):**  So as things stand, this cycle globally removes between 10 and 100 million metric tons of  
**[0:16:46-0:16:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:16:46):**  CO2 from our atmosphere every year.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:16:48):**  It's one of the key geological sinks for carbon dioxide from our atmosphere, which is why  
**[0:16:54-0:16:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:16:54):**  we haven't yet fully cooked.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:16:57):**  To increase that cycle and the speed of that cycle, we take certain types of rock, we grind  
**[0:17:03-0:17:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:17:03):**  them up into a fine dust and we put them onto the ground and then we wait for it to rain.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:17:10):**  And that increases the rate of the reaction and allows us to remove a lot more CO2 from  
**[0:17:15-0:17:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:17:15):**  the atmosphere through that process.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:17:17):**  So together with the biochar, you're saying a 10X.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:17:20):**  Just to put it in perspective, like let's talk about an acre or a hectare.  
**[0:17:26-0:17:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:17:26):**  In Scotland, what's your average carbon potential there if things are good or things are average?  
**[0:17:31-0:17:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:17:31):**  What do you see?  
**[0:17:32-0:17:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:17:32):**  So you're looking at about 400, you'll get about 400 tons of carbon per hectare in a  
**[0:17:40-0:17:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:17:40):**  standing forest somewhere around there.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:17:42):**  Per year?  
**[0:17:43-0:17:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:17:43):**  No, total 400 tons once it's fully grown.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:17:46):**  Which is 10 years or 15, 20, whatsoever?  
**[0:17:50-0:17:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:17:50):**  If you're planting deciduous forests like we are, you'll be talking 60 years to get  
**[0:17:54-0:17:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:17:54):**  to that sort of carbon balance.  
**[0:17:56-0:17:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:17:56):**  It can go higher with deciduous forests as well.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:17:58):**  But if you've got something like Sitka spruce, again, that'll grow quicker and store that  
**[0:18:04-0:18:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:18:04):**  carbon.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:18:05):**  With enhanced weathering, depending on how you view that, maybe six tons per year or  
**[0:18:10-0:18:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:18:10):**  something around that level, we can get 13 tons a year of carbon removal from enhanced  
**[0:18:17-0:18:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:18:17):**  weathering.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:18:18):**  And biochar is more reliant on feedstock.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:18:20):**  We could put down quite a lot of biochar on the ground if we can get access to enough  
**[0:18:24-0:18:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:18:24):**  feedstock.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:18:25):**  The big difference is that enhanced weathering is permanent.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:18:29):**  Once that process has occurred, that carbon dioxide is locked up in geological formations.  
**[0:18:34-0:18:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:18:34):**  So you're talking 100,000 years to a million years, depending on which pathway it goes.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:18:40):**  But all of that carbon is permanently removed.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:18:43):**  So in human terms, we don't have to worry about it again.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:18:45):**  Which probably means like why you're able to sell that enhanced weathering credits,  
**[0:18:49-0:18:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:18:49):**  even though it's quite experimental, at least at a scale, there are companies or there are  
**[0:18:53-0:18:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:18:53):**  buyers of these credits interested in that side of experimentation.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:18:57):**  To a degree, they're funding our research and development at this stage with a high  
**[0:19:02-0:19:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:19:02):**  degree of confidence that we'll be able to remove that CO2 for them.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:19:05):**  Are you willing, I mean, obviously say no, if not to share like what kind of tonnage  
**[0:19:10-0:19:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:19:10):**  prices you're getting?  
**[0:19:12-0:19:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:19:12):**  Or is that something that you're rather not sure?  
**[0:19:14-0:19:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:19:14):**  Yeah, it's out in the public domain.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:19:16):**  So Stripe, who are one of our backers, and who some people will know from credit card  
**[0:19:22-0:19:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:19:22):**  processing, they have bought credits from us, they've published everything around that,  
**[0:19:27-0:19:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:19:27):**  they're very transparent.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:19:28):**  They're paying us $200 per ton of CO2 for that carbon dioxide removal through enhanced  
**[0:19:34-0:19:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:19:34):**  weathering.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:19:35):**  Which is a very significant price per ton, which they hope, and you hope probably also  
**[0:19:39-0:19:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:19:39):**  comes down at some point.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:19:40):**  But now, do you feel that that's the carbon market role at the moment?  
**[0:19:45-0:19:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:19:45):**  Like there are very good prices for very specific niches at the moment and basically funding  
**[0:19:51-0:19:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:19:51):**  a lot of your development and maybe others to really see, okay, how do we do ecosystem  
**[0:19:55-0:19:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:19:55):**  restoration and regeneration at scale?  
**[0:19:57-0:20:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:19:57):**  And we all know that that market is not going to last forever.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:20:00):**  It might go up and down, it will be a rough ride, or maybe the biochar market goes up  
**[0:20:04-0:20:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:20:04):**  and you know, it's weathering comes down, etc.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:20:05):**  Do you see that as a short term to kickstart a lot of things?  
**[0:20:09-0:20:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:20:09):**  Or do you see the CO2 or the carbon markets differently?  
**[0:20:12-0:20:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:20:12):**  No, I see them somewhat differently.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:20:14):**  I think that permanent carbon removal will continue to be a high priced product.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:20:21):**  I think it's in a different asset class to soil and tree carbon.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:20:26):**  And it rightfully should have a higher price.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:20:28):**  We have a very, very big problem.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:20:31):**  Demand outstripped supply, we could sell 10 times easily the amount of carbon we're producing  
**[0:20:38-0:20:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:20:38):**  without any outbound marketing.  
**[0:20:39-0:20:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:20:39):**  As things stand, and if you look at all the pledges coming from companies, this is going  
**[0:20:45-0:20:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:20:45):**  to grow and grow.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:20:46):**  But quality, I think, is going to become more and more important in the marketplace because  
**[0:20:51-0:20:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:20:51):**  there are too many dodgy schemes.  
**[0:20:54-0:21:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:20:54):**  So Kyoto era credits that are really not worth the junk bonds.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:21:01):**  They've not really removed any carbon.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:21:03):**  They're pretty sketchy schemes.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:21:06):**  I worry, as I alluded to about soil carbon, particularly in arable soils where you can  
**[0:21:12-0:21:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:21:12):**  just drag a plough over it and release it again.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:21:15):**  I'm not saying that farmers intend to do that, but a change in management regime will release  
**[0:21:20-0:21:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:21:20):**  that carbon almost virtually immediately.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:21:23):**  So walk us through an average project.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:21:25):**  What do we as this is audio, so make it as visual as possible.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:21:29):**  What does the land look like when you buy it?  
**[0:21:32-0:21:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:21:32):**  And then what happens over the years very quickly and slowly at the same time?  
**[0:21:37-0:21:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:21:37):**  How does this change?  
**[0:21:38-0:21:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:21:38):**  And how is it different from a relatively standard, let's say, between brackets, reforestation  
**[0:21:43-0:21:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:21:43):**  project that some people might know it might even helped with to plant some trees here  
**[0:21:47-0:21:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:21:47):**  and there?  
**[0:21:48-0:21:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:21:48):**  Yeah, you wouldn't see a huge difference between what we're doing on the ground and another  
**[0:21:53-0:21:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:21:53):**  reforestation project.  
**[0:21:54-0:21:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:21:54):**  We hope that the trees will grow quicker.  
**[0:21:57-0:21:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:21:57):**  We're not far enough into it to know that yet.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:21:59):**  But the biochar acts as a fertilizer as well.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:22:02):**  So the biochar, the biochar acts as a soil amendment.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:22:05):**  So it will help against drought and will store nutrients.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:22:08):**  The enhanced weathering material actually acts as a fertilizer.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:22:11):**  It releases cations, which depending on what state soil is in, will cause the forest to  
**[0:22:16-0:22:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:22:16):**  actually grow quicker as well.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:22:18):**  So you might see our forests developing quicker, but we're doing the science behind our planting  
**[0:22:23-0:22:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:22:23):**  at the moment to demonstrate that we're not far enough on with this in any location to  
**[0:22:28-0:22:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:22:28):**  have that data yet.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:22:30):**  You would see typically degraded land would be our focus.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:22:34):**  Like an old dairy farm or like a sheep farm?  
**[0:22:37-0:22:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:22:37):**  What would you imagine in Scotland that you're buying?  
**[0:22:40-0:22:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:22:40):**  Yeah, so it's often extensive grazing operations that aren't particularly well managed.  
**[0:22:46-0:22:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:22:46):**  So for instance, we have a site where we have about 2000 acres, so about 800 hectares.  
**[0:22:54-0:23:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:22:54):**  And we think that we're moving on to a rotational grazing model with the livestock to make it  
**[0:23:00-0:23:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:23:00):**  far more intensive.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:23:02):**  We're moving them onto the better land.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:23:04):**  We'll probably only use a crazy amount of the land, less than 10% of the land to actually  
**[0:23:09-0:23:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:23:09):**  graze all the livestock on.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:23:11):**  Once we move them onto a rotational grazing, things like lambing rates are terrible.  
**[0:23:17-0:23:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:23:17):**  So just by better luck.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:23:19):**  So you're improving, intensifying the farming side of things and then taking the rest into  
**[0:23:24-0:23:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:23:24):**  the forestry or reforestation?  
**[0:23:26-0:23:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:23:26):**  Yeah, to prevent leakage.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:23:28):**  So what we don't want is the unintended consequences of taking that land out of action.  
**[0:23:33-0:23:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:23:33):**  But we also try and introduce and again, we're too early to know how well this will work.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:23:37):**  But we're introducing nut crops and fruit crops so that we are displacing some of the  
**[0:23:42-0:23:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:23:42):**  meat production, which we don't think is a long term model that we really want to be  
**[0:23:47-0:23:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:23:47):**  doing, but we also don't want to create unintended consequences in clearing of Brazilian rainforest.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:23:52):**  The classic example and the danger is that we act as do-gooders in Scotland and we plant  
**[0:23:57-0:23:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:23:57):**  up 1000 acres in Scotland.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:23:59):**  And that requires somewhere around 3000 acres of Amazonian rainforest to get the same production.  
**[0:24:05-0:24:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:24:05):**  That needs clearing.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:24:06):**  So we've just planted 1000 acres and cleared 3000 acres of rainforest by accident, which  
**[0:24:12-0:24:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:24:12):**  we want to completely avoid.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:24:13):**  So leakage becomes a really key thing for us to think about.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:24:17):**  But the more of that we can move to permanent nut crops, for example, the better.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:24:22):**  And so that basically turns it into an agroforestry system and not necessarily just between brackets  
**[0:24:28-0:24:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:24:28):**  of forest.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:24:29):**  Where do you see that going?  
**[0:24:30-0:24:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:24:30):**  Yeah, and even the grazing system will be agroforestry.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:24:33):**  So the way we're not quite sure on those bits yet, but we're hoping to actually find regenerative  
**[0:24:39-0:24:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:24:39):**  farmers who want to operate those.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:24:41):**  It's not what we actually do to scale and to have the impact that we want to have.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:24:46):**  It doesn't fit into our core model.  
**[0:24:49-0:24:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:24:49):**  So we're doing that, but we want to find farmers who want those opportunities.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:24:53):**  And just in terms of scale, how many hectares or acres are you currently owning?  
**[0:24:57-0:25:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:24:57):**  Just to give a sense of this isn't a few here and there.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:25:01):**  No, it's growing quite rapidly.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:25:02):**  So last count, I think we've got about 5000 hectares under management.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:25:09):**  And that's over a two year period.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:25:13):**  And we're currently seeking debt funding to expand that further with an intention of getting  
**[0:25:17-0:25:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:25:17):**  to 50,000 hectares as fast as we possibly can.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:25:21):**  Because you said there's such a demand for the credits you're producing.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:25:24):**  Can you walk us through, because it was going to be my next question, but how do you finance  
**[0:25:28-0:25:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:25:28):**  it?  
**[0:25:29-0:25:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:25:29):**  You mentioned debt funding.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:25:30):**  What does a typical structure look like and where do you see that going?  
**[0:25:33-0:25:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:25:33):**  Because we've mentioned scale quite a bit at the beginning of this interview to see  
**[0:25:37-0:25:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:25:37):**  where you can see this model or these models, because they're all context specific, go.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:25:42):**  And what's the role of because you mentioned profit also at the beginning, what's the role  
**[0:25:45-0:25:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:25:45):**  of money there?  
**[0:25:46-0:25:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:25:46):**  So at the moment, we typically are financing this through high net worths who are lending  
**[0:25:53-0:25:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:25:53):**  us money and getting a commercial return on it.  
**[0:25:56-0:26:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:25:56):**  And we secure their money on the asset so that they've got an asset backed security  
**[0:26:01-0:26:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:26:01):**  effectively and earning interest from us.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:26:05):**  And the company itself is funded through equity investment.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:26:09):**  And we've been very successful with the equity investment today.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:26:14):**  But we also are generating cash from sale of credits and building out the operations  
**[0:26:19-0:26:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:26:19):**  there.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:26:20):**  Further forward, we see this as an institutional investment proposition.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:26:25):**  So the difficulty with institutional investment is that's not an early stage thing.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:26:30):**  You need to get to a certain size before it's of interest.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:26:32):**  What do you think that size is?  
**[0:26:34-0:26:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:26:34):**  Like what are you currently targeting in depth?  
**[0:26:36-0:26:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:26:36):**  And how many X do you need to go before institutionals will become interested?  
**[0:26:41-0:26:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:26:41):**  We think you need to get to what certainly needs to be several tens of millions of dollars  
**[0:26:46-0:26:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:26:46):**  before larger institutions are interested.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:26:50):**  We are now having conversations with institutions who can deploy slightly smaller checks, but  
**[0:26:55-0:27:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:26:55):**  also some that potentially can do the hundred million dollar checks that we ultimately want  
**[0:27:00-0:27:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:27:00):**  to be taking for land purchases.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:27:03):**  Again as depth, meaning buying the land, doing that process, earning an interest on that.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:27:10):**  And then the land stays with the future forest companies we discussed before.  
**[0:27:15-0:27:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:27:15):**  That's right.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:27:16):**  And we always have that hold over the land.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:27:18):**  So that land is coming back to us as long as we don't default on our debt, obviously.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:27:22):**  But today that's not been a problem.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:27:24):**  But yeah, it's a case of using debt to buy the land so we can generate the revenue to  
**[0:27:29-0:27:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:27:29):**  pay back.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:27:30):**  And most of that revenue comes from the credits and will continue to generate.  
**[0:27:34-0:27:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:27:34):**  I mean, 60 years is a long period before it hits the plateau.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:27:38):**  And we might have figured out a lot of other ways by then to add on to the biochart and  
**[0:27:42-0:27:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:27:42):**  enhance weathering to speed that up even further.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:27:44):**  So it's basically how many X do you need to grow?  
**[0:27:47-0:27:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:27:47):**  Like you're doing a couple of million now in depth or looking for a couple of million  
**[0:27:50-0:27:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:27:50):**  you need to go to.  
**[0:27:51-0:27:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:27:51):**  You said 20, 30, 50 before these bigger insurance companies, et cetera, become interested.  
**[0:27:57-0:28:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:27:57):**  Or they're already talking to you and they might want to get you there because that will  
**[0:28:00-0:28:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:28:00):**  be even more interesting.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:28:01):**  Yeah, they're starting to talk to us now.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:28:03):**  And we have institutions who potentially will write us tens of millions of checks.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:28:07):**  We're not at the stage yet where anybody's knocking our door down to give us 100 million  
**[0:28:12-0:28:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:28:12):**  pound checks.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:28:13):**  But hopefully we're not that far off it.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:28:14):**  Because the demand is there, just to be clear, the demand of credits is there.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:28:18):**  And is the land also there to get your hands on in those places with the right rule of  
**[0:28:22-0:28:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:28:22):**  law and the right weather where fires are not so dangerous?  
**[0:28:26-0:28:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:28:26):**  The land is there.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:28:27):**  We have the pipelines.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:28:28):**  We have our investment thesis behind that.  
**[0:28:30-0:28:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:28:30):**  We know which sort of areas of the world we want to operate in.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:28:33):**  Obviously just be Scotland.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:28:35):**  Scotland is big, but not that big.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:28:37):**  It's nowhere near big enough for what we're trying to achieve.  
**[0:28:40-0:28:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:28:40):**  So we have target areas where we want to buy land and we're building out the organization  
**[0:28:45-0:28:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:28:45):**  that will be capable of managing that.  
**[0:28:47-0:28:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:28:47):**  So yeah, I think, yeah, because massive tree plantation plus of course you have to find  
**[0:28:51-0:28:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:28:51):**  the farmers but still potentially managing animals at the beginning, planting tree crops,  
**[0:28:56-0:28:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:28:56):**  like nut trees.  
**[0:28:57-0:28:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:28:57):**  Do you harvest that as well?  
**[0:28:58-0:29:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:28:58):**  Are you going to go into the agriculture, the food side of things or how do you see  
**[0:29:02-0:29:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:29:02):**  that?  
**[0:29:03-0:29:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:29:03):**  We don't see that as part of our core business.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:29:06):**  I think we'll have to demonstrate that, prove that out.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:29:09):**  But we hope that again, that we can find partners who want to do that.  
**[0:29:14-0:29:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:29:14):**  We think that part of the barrier to regenerative agriculture is access to land.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:29:20):**  And whilst we're doing the other things, we can facilitate that.  
**[0:29:24-0:29:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:29:24):**  So when you get into farming, you've got to know that land.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:29:27):**  You've got to really build a bond with that land and that's hard to do.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:29:33):**  As a large organization, I think it's far better to have farmers who know the area that  
**[0:29:39-0:29:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:29:39):**  they're farming.  
**[0:29:40-0:29:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:29:40):**  So hopefully we'll be able to facilitate that.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:29:42):**  Otherwise you end up in a one size fits all cropping system, which we all know exists  
**[0:29:48-0:29:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:29:48):**  and has big farming operators on it and brings with it a range of other problems.  
**[0:29:53-0:29:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:29:53):**  Have you seen that already, like the local community or around the properties you've  
**[0:29:58-0:29:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:29:58):**  bought?  
**[0:29:59-0:30:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:29:59):**  I mean, 5,000 is not a small number.  
**[0:30:01-0:30:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:30:01):**  How has been the response and the willingness or potential interest to engage, to work with  
**[0:30:05-0:30:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:30:05):**  you, to work potentially the land in a different way than it was found before?  
**[0:30:09-0:30:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:30:09):**  I think it's always mixed.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:30:13):**  There's people who have a traditional view or a view of how the world's always been around  
**[0:30:21-0:30:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:30:21):**  them and don't want that to change.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:30:23):**  There are also people who get excited by a vision of a different future.  
**[0:30:28-0:30:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:30:28):**  So I think it's always going to be something where we try and take people with us, but  
**[0:30:33-0:30:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:30:33):**  you're never going to please everybody all the time.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:30:37):**  You shouldn't, otherwise you're doing something wrong.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:30:39):**  And where do you see, I mean, you mentioned leakage a few times, obviously, or potentially  
**[0:30:43-0:30:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:30:43):**  don't want to create this ecosystem with a big fence around it, obviously protect it,  
**[0:30:47-0:30:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:30:47):**  but where do you see this agroforestry or the food piece with the nuts, etc.?  
**[0:30:52-0:30:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:30:52):**  What else do you see there potentially in these ecosystems that could produce calories  
**[0:30:56-0:30:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:30:56):**  for us to eat?  
**[0:30:57-0:31:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:30:57):**  Are there any other things you're working on there to enhance, to not damage obviously  
**[0:31:01-0:31:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:31:01):**  the biochar and enhance weathering, but also to create other income streams or other usage  
**[0:31:06-0:31:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:31:06):**  of the land and only the biodiversity, which is extremely important, but not the only uses?  
**[0:31:11-0:31:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:31:11):**  No, but we're clearly creating a timber crop though as well of some sort.  
**[0:31:15-0:31:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:31:15):**  And whilst we don't set a stall out as harvesting timber, we're not a forestry company in that  
**[0:31:20-0:31:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:31:20):**  way.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:31:21):**  And this questions about what we do with the forest long term, because you want to be reusing  
**[0:31:27-0:31:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:31:27):**  that land ultimately to sequester more carbon.  
**[0:31:30-0:31:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:31:30):**  Once a forest hits sort of balance point, it's no longer providing that carbon removing  
**[0:31:37-0:31:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:31:37):**  service.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:31:38):**  So there's an argument to say that we should be selectively felling.  
**[0:31:41-0:31:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:31:41):**  It's not a decision I'll ever have to make with these forests.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:31:44):**  I'll be long retired, hopefully.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:31:46):**  But in 60 years time, I think we probably should be taking a very, very light touch  
**[0:31:52-0:31:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:31:52):**  approach to harvesting high quality hardwood timber from the forests.  
**[0:31:56-0:32:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:31:56):**  It will actually benefit the forest in terms of creating mixed age forests, mixed habitat.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:32:03):**  Regrowth.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:32:04):**  Yeah.  
**[0:32:05-0:32:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:32:05):**  And the regrowth that will come through there creates a new type of habitat, a different  
**[0:32:08-0:32:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:32:08):**  type of habitat.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:32:09):**  In natural forests, you don't have all one age.  
**[0:32:12-0:32:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:32:12):**  And that's the problem with planting trees.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:32:13):**  You tend to plant them all at the same time.  
**[0:32:15-0:32:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:32:15):**  They're all going to be the same age.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:32:17):**  So some selective thinning helps.  
**[0:32:19-0:32:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:32:19):**  Some selective harvesting probably will help.  
**[0:32:21-0:32:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:32:21):**  But it's also contentious because these aren't easy things to communicate with people.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:32:26):**  And people think that trees good and cutting trees bad.  
**[0:32:31-0:32:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:32:31):**  And what they don't appreciate is that if we take that timber at the right time, probably,  
**[0:32:36-0:32:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:32:36):**  make high quality furniture, for example, as one of the products that might then store  
**[0:32:41-0:32:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:32:41):**  that carbon for a further thousand years in people's homes, which is what we ultimately  
**[0:32:47-0:32:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:32:47):**  want to happen with it.  
**[0:32:49-0:32:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:32:49):**  And in its place, there'll be another tree growing, taking four tons of carbon, six tons  
**[0:32:53-0:32:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:32:53):**  of carbon outside per hectare out of the atmosphere every year.  
**[0:32:57-0:33:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:32:57):**  So I think there's more holistic ways of managing these.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:33:00):**  There's a lot of education there.  
**[0:33:02-0:33:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:33:02):**  Yeah, it's very hard.  
**[0:33:03-0:33:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:33:03):**  It's hard to communicate that to people.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:33:05):**  But I paid for that tree.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:33:06):**  Yeah, but it's better if we cut it now.  
**[0:33:08-0:33:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:33:08):**  Yeah.  
**[0:33:09-0:33:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:33:09):**  Yeah.  
**[0:33:10-0:33:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:33:10):**  People don't get that.  
**[0:33:11-0:33:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:33:11):**  It's very polarized.  
**[0:33:13-0:33:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:33:13):**  Monoculture, plantations bad and mixed species good.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:33:18):**  Now we'd much prefer the mixed species because of the biodiversity net gain.  
**[0:33:23-0:33:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:33:23):**  But at the same time, we need more timber if we're going to displace carbon products,  
**[0:33:29-0:33:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:33:29):**  carbon heavy products like cement in our building materials.  
**[0:33:32-0:33:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:33:32):**  So these are really complicated issues.  
**[0:33:35-0:33:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:33:35):**  And whilst it's great to tell a simple story from a communications point of view, it's  
**[0:33:41-0:33:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:33:41):**  usually wrong.  
**[0:33:42-0:33:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:33:42):**  Yeah, every complex.  
**[0:33:43-0:33:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:33:43):**  I remember the quote, I have to find it.  
**[0:33:45-0:33:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:33:45):**  Every complex problem has a very simple solution that's also wrong.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:33:50):**  Yeah.  
**[0:33:51-0:33:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:33:51):**  Yeah.  
**[0:33:52-0:33:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:33:52):**  Sounds nice on paper, but it doesn't work.  
**[0:33:53-0:33:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:33:53):**  Yeah.  
**[0:33:54-0:33:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:33:54):**  And it's for sure create some issues somewhere else, or actually in the same place.  
**[0:33:58-0:33:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:33:58):**  Ecosystems don't function like that.  
**[0:33:59-0:34:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:33:59):**  These are nonlinear sort of relationships and you need to treat them as such.  
**[0:34:05-0:34:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:34:05):**  So yeah, I'm glad that's not probably not going to be on my watch to decide about felling  
**[0:34:09-0:34:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:34:09):**  trees that we've planted.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:34:11):**  And then it might grow so fast that you actually have to.  
**[0:34:13-0:34:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:34:13):**  Yeah, that would be a good problem to have.  
**[0:34:16-0:34:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:34:16):**  And so how was that journey with you mentioned, I mean, the depth investors, I can completely  
**[0:34:20-0:34:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:34:20):**  understand they get a nice coupon on their debt.  
**[0:34:23-0:34:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:34:23):**  And at some point you buy back basically the initial investments, the land stays with you,  
**[0:34:28-0:34:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:34:28):**  but they get an interesting any return at this stage is interesting.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:34:31):**  And there's a good story.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:34:32):**  But the equity ones, this is a very long term play.  
**[0:34:36-0:34:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:34:36):**  A lot of interesting, let's say, revenue opportunities now revenue coming in, etc.  
**[0:34:39-0:34:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:34:39):**  But I'm imagining you picked your investors as long term investors with you as well.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:34:44):**  How was that journey?  
**[0:34:46-0:34:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:34:46):**  Were they all did they need a lot of education?  
**[0:34:48-0:34:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:34:48):**  What was the biggest surprise you got from people wanting to invest but potentially not  
**[0:34:52-0:34:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:34:52):**  getting what you were building?  
**[0:34:54-0:34:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:34:54):**  I'm always curious what the responses from the investment world to things like this holistic  
**[0:34:59-0:35:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:34:59):**  compared to a lot of the linear things they might get on their desk.  
**[0:35:02-0:35:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:35:02):**  So the biggest surprise was how easy it was for us to raise investment and how fast it  
**[0:35:09-0:35:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:35:09):**  happened.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:35:10):**  That's good to hear.  
**[0:35:11-0:35:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:35:11):**  Yeah.  
**[0:35:12-0:35:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:35:12):**  Yeah.  
**[0:35:13-0:35:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:35:13):**  So our first investment came from two meetings in one day and we were oversubscribed seven  
**[0:35:19-0:35:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:35:19):**  and a half fold.  
**[0:35:20-0:35:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:35:20):**  Wow.  
**[0:35:21-0:35:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:35:21):**  That was very fortunate.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:35:22):**  The second time.  
**[0:35:24-0:35:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:35:24):**  Did they all get it or they were just believing you?  
**[0:35:26-0:35:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:35:26):**  No, I think they got the scale of the problem that we're facing and that we were developing  
**[0:35:32-0:35:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:35:32):**  models to tackle that without really knowing where we'd end up at that stage.  
**[0:35:36-0:35:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:35:36):**  And that's kind of the nice thing with a very early stage investment is it's a bit I guess  
**[0:35:41-0:35:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:35:41):**  people are investing in in the vision of where you're going and they know you're going to  
**[0:35:45-0:35:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:35:45):**  deviate from that or they expect you to deviate from that.  
**[0:35:48-0:35:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:35:48):**  So you get quite a lot of wiggle room going back to raise more money.  
**[0:35:51-0:35:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:35:51):**  You've got to have something a bit more tangible.  
**[0:35:53-0:35:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:35:53):**  And we raised the second round of investment and it closed about three months ago now.  
**[0:35:59-0:36:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:35:59):**  And again, we were pleasantly surprised, significantly over raised and at a very good valuation with  
**[0:36:05-0:36:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:36:05):**  some great investors.  
**[0:36:07-0:36:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:36:07):**  And no, I won't disclose what that is because we've not announced it yet.  
**[0:36:10-0:36:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:36:10):**  I wasn't going to ask.  
**[0:36:11-0:36:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:36:11):**  Don't worry.  
**[0:36:12-0:36:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:36:12):**  Don't worry.  
**[0:36:13-0:36:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:36:13):**  I wasn't going to ask.  
**[0:36:14-0:36:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:36:14):**  And we probably won't.  
**[0:36:15-0:36:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:36:15):**  We won't announce it.  
**[0:36:16-0:36:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:36:16):**  I don't think.  
**[0:36:17-0:36:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:36:17):**  No, but it's very interesting because I think hopefully shows there is a group of investors  
**[0:36:20-0:36:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:36:20):**  out there that sees the scale of the problem or all the problems and is willing to place  
**[0:36:25-0:36:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:36:25):**  at least some bets and make sure people like you and the whole team can get to work and  
**[0:36:30-0:36:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:36:30):**  figure out a lot of things as we don't know a lot of things.  
**[0:36:33-0:36:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:36:33):**  But we do know we need a lot more ecosystems and a lot more biodiversity.  
**[0:36:37-0:36:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:36:37):**  Yeah, for sure.  
**[0:36:38-0:36:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:36:38):**  And I think there are investors there who are keen to back the right projects.  
**[0:36:44-0:36:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:36:44):**  And I don't think that makes it easy to raise investment.  
**[0:36:47-0:36:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:36:47):**  I think this is a piece of understanding how to scale the business, how to grow the business,  
**[0:36:54-0:36:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:36:54):**  because that's ultimately where they get the returns from.  
**[0:36:58-0:37:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:36:58):**  And to ask a few questions that I always like to ask and not necessarily to end with, but  
**[0:37:03-0:37:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:37:03):**  I always like to repeat a few of those and see the response.  
**[0:37:07-0:37:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:37:07):**  What do you believe to be true about regenerative agriculture that others don't?  
**[0:37:11-0:37:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:37:11):**  So where are you contrarian?  
**[0:37:12-0:37:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:37:12):**  This is definitely inspired by John Kempf that always asks a similar question.  
**[0:37:16-0:37:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:37:16):**  So where do you see, I can see a number of things.  
**[0:37:19-0:37:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:37:19):**  What's the main thing where you see yourself contrarian in, let's say, the whole regeneration  
**[0:37:24-0:37:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:37:24):**  movement?  
**[0:37:25-0:37:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:37:25):**  Yeah, farming is not the revenue.  
**[0:37:28-0:37:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:37:28):**  Farming might be the model and might be the desire and might be why people want to do  
**[0:37:32-0:37:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:37:32):**  it.  
**[0:37:33-0:37:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:37:33):**  But you're selling a commodity at that point.  
**[0:37:37-0:37:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:37:37):**  And I think people understand the sort of idea of selling a story and attaching a story  
**[0:37:41-0:37:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:37:41):**  to your product.  
**[0:37:42-0:37:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:37:42):**  But actually, I think there's going to be far more money in this space for people who  
**[0:37:48-0:37:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:37:48):**  are selling other services.  
**[0:37:50-0:37:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:37:50):**  And they might be farming still.  
**[0:37:51-0:37:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:37:51):**  I hope they'll still be farming because we still need to feed people.  
**[0:37:54-0:38:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:37:54):**  But the other value adds around that carbon and biodiversity, which we've sort of touched  
**[0:38:00-0:38:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:38:00):**  on a couple of times, but I think biodiversity is going to become a huge element of farming.  
**[0:38:03-0:38:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:38:03):**  I hope it will, because it will bring farming back to being a positive impact on the landscape,  
**[0:38:11-0:38:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:38:11):**  as opposed to what has been for certainly my lifetime, negative impact on our landscape.  
**[0:38:18-0:38:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:38:18):**  Very, very much negative impact.  
**[0:38:21-0:38:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:38:21):**  And if you could change one thing, if you have a magic wand and you could change one  
**[0:38:25-0:38:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:38:25):**  thing in the food agriculture, but let's say the general land use space, what would you  
**[0:38:30-0:38:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:38:30):**  do?  
**[0:38:31-0:38:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:38:31):**  Can I get rid of Monsanto?  
**[0:38:32-0:38:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:38:32):**  Of course.  
**[0:38:33-0:38:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:38:33):**  Can I just make them disappear?  
**[0:38:34-0:38:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:38:34):**  But all of the chemical input, I mean, because there are many others, they're not the only  
**[0:38:38-0:38:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:38:38):**  one.  
**[0:38:39-0:38:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:38:39):**  I won't be scared by saying, let's get rid of this one pesticide, which actually is,  
**[0:38:43-0:38:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:38:43):**  I think, off-patent and made by a lot of other people.  
**[0:38:46-0:38:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:38:46):**  And then for sure, somebody finds another cocktail.  
**[0:38:48-0:38:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:38:48):**  That's my fear of naming a blame.  
**[0:38:51-0:38:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:38:51):**  I say that tongue in cheek.  
**[0:38:52-0:38:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:38:52):**  I think they symbolize something.  
**[0:38:54-0:38:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:38:54):**  But in actual fact, if we're to feed people and we don't want to cause all kinds of social  
**[0:38:58-0:39:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:38:58):**  problems, then actually they're part of the ecosystem right now.  
**[0:39:02-0:39:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:39:02):**  So the two things I would change, which are very closely related, I would bring in a global  
**[0:39:08-0:39:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:39:08):**  carbon tax on everything, embodied energy in every product we buy everywhere, and a  
**[0:39:16-0:39:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:39:16):**  biodiversity tax so that both of those products could be monetized by good land managers.  
**[0:39:23-0:39:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:39:23):**  And this might be actually not so far off, but what?  
**[0:39:27-0:39:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:39:27):**  So we take your magic wand away, but you are in charge of a $1 billion or a billion pound  
**[0:39:32-0:39:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:39:32):**  sterling or euro, whatever you prefer, investment fund.  
**[0:39:36-0:39:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:39:36):**  And you have a potentially long term view if you want to, but it has to be, it is a  
**[0:39:40-0:39:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:39:40):**  return focused, any return.  
**[0:39:43-0:39:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:39:43):**  What would you focus on?  
**[0:39:44-0:39:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:39:44):**  What would you invest this amount in?  
**[0:39:45-0:39:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:39:45):**  Would it go to technology?  
**[0:39:46-0:39:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:39:46):**  Would it go to buying a lot of land?  
**[0:39:48-0:39:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:39:48):**  Would it go to getting ready for a tax like you just described?  
**[0:39:51-0:39:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:39:51):**  What would you focus on as a new fund manager that's managing quite a large amount?  
**[0:39:55-0:39:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:39:55):**  I would be buying land that's under conventional, sorry, I hate that term.  
**[0:39:59-0:40:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:39:59):**  I shouldn't use it.  
**[0:40:00-0:40:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:40:00):**  I was going to say under conventional agriculture.  
**[0:40:02-0:40:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:40:02):**  It's not conventional.  
**[0:40:03-0:40:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:40:03):**  It's extractive agriculture.  
**[0:40:04-0:40:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:40:04):**  Extractive agriculture.  
**[0:40:05-0:40:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:40:05):**  Yeah.  
**[0:40:06-0:40:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:40:06):**  Chemical agriculture.  
**[0:40:07-0:40:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:40:07):**  I'd buy a big swath of land that are being mismanaged and degraded and put them under  
**[0:40:12-0:40:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:40:12):**  specific places if you had that freedom to go anywhere.  
**[0:40:16-0:40:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:40:16):**  Are there specific hotspots where you would act?  
**[0:40:18-0:40:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:40:18):**  Would it be Scotland or not?  
**[0:40:20-0:40:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:40:20):**  Scotland would be one of them.  
**[0:40:21-0:40:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:40:21):**  And we have our investment thesis, which I'm not going to get into, but we have a number  
**[0:40:26-0:40:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:40:26):**  of other locations where we would, and we'd deploy that, you know, a billion dollars wouldn't  
**[0:40:31-0:40:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:40:31):**  go that far.  
**[0:40:32-0:40:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:40:32):**  Yeah.  
**[0:40:33-0:40:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:40:33):**  I think we'd have that spent within 18 months for you.  
**[0:40:35-0:40:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:40:35):**  I should increase this question to like 10 or a hundred.  
**[0:40:37-0:40:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:40:37):**  It doesn't scare people anymore.  
**[0:40:40-0:40:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:40:40):**  I need to change my questions.  
**[0:40:41-0:40:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:40:41):**  Okay.  
**[0:40:42-0:40:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:40:42):**  Listeners next time, it will be a few zeros more because we printed so much of this stuff  
**[0:40:46-0:40:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:40:46):**  and land is expensive in a lot of places, not all, but in a lot of places.  
**[0:40:49-0:40:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:40:49):**  Yeah.  
**[0:40:50-0:40:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:40:50):**  A billion doesn't go that far.  
**[0:40:51-0:40:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:40:51):**  If I talk to technologists, it's very different.  
**[0:40:53-0:40:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:40:53):**  They would have a lot of different places to put this.  
**[0:40:55-0:40:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:40:55):**  But yeah, as soon as you talk about land, it absorbs it quite quickly.  
**[0:40:59-0:41:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:40:59):**  And so where do you see where now just before the summer, I mean, depends where you are.  
**[0:41:03-0:41:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:41:03):**  Maybe it's already summer or maybe you're in the middle of the winter.  
**[0:41:05-0:41:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:41:05):**  What is the biggest thing for the next, let's say you mentioned 18 months.  
**[0:41:09-0:41:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:41:09):**  Let's use 18 months for you now to go through.  
**[0:41:11-0:41:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:41:11):**  And if we talk in a year, where will you be if we talk like in 12 months or so?  
**[0:41:15-0:41:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:41:15):**  What's the biggest barrier?  
**[0:41:16-0:41:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:41:16):**  Is it more depth?  
**[0:41:17-0:41:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:41:17):**  Is it depth?  
**[0:41:18-0:41:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:41:18):**  Sorry, more depth also, but more depth.  
**[0:41:21-0:41:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:41:21):**  Is it more staff?  
**[0:41:22-0:41:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:41:22):**  What's the biggest barrier?  
**[0:41:23-0:41:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:41:23):**  More land?  
**[0:41:24-0:41:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:41:24):**  So we're doing quite well, I think, on scaling up the team at the moment that we will end  
**[0:41:28-0:41:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:41:28):**  up growing the team and more debt for buying more land, certainly more access to land,  
**[0:41:33-0:41:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:41:33):**  hopefully new ways of us having long term control over land that enable us to scale.  
**[0:41:39-0:41:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:41:39):**  Meaning you're potentially not buying but getting control long, long, long term, I'm  
**[0:41:43-0:41:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:41:43):**  thinking hundreds of years, you don't need to own it.  
**[0:41:46-0:41:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:41:46):**  Which then the billion goes a lot further.  
**[0:41:48-0:41:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:41:48):**  A lot further.  
**[0:41:49-0:41:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:41:49):**  Yeah.  
**[0:41:50-0:41:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:41:50):**  And I think we'll see a very significant change in the amount of carbon that we're sequestering.  
**[0:41:57-0:42:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:41:57):**  And we'll probably make some pretty big public commitments to that in the very near future.  
**[0:42:02-0:42:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:42:02):**  Meaning you're like underestimating currently or you're looking at other technologies or  
**[0:42:06-0:42:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:42:06):**  other ways to push that further?  
**[0:42:08-0:42:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:42:08):**  The 10x you mentioned?  
**[0:42:09-0:42:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:42:09):**  No existing technologies, but with different models to serious scale sooner.  
**[0:42:15-0:42:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:42:15):**  And that's the challenge when our objectives are primarily to remove carbon.  
**[0:42:20-0:42:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:42:20):**  How do we maximize that carbon removal with?  
**[0:42:23-0:42:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:42:23):**  Like how do you get biochar everywhere?  
**[0:42:24-0:42:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:42:24):**  Yeah, how do we stop any waste being burnt on a field?  
**[0:42:28-0:42:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:42:28):**  No one should be burning the crop waste.  
**[0:42:31-0:42:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:42:31):**  Bureaucracy and make it valuable and get the carbon credits, install the carbon and enhance  
**[0:42:35-0:42:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:42:35):**  your soil for future generations.  
**[0:42:38-0:42:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:42:38):**  And why aren't we all applying mineral fertilizers as opposed to buying NPK fertilizers made  
**[0:42:44-0:42:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:42:44):**  from oil?  
**[0:42:45-0:42:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:42:45):**  And how do we, you know, and removing CO2 from the atmosphere at the same time?  
**[0:42:49-0:42:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:42:49):**  Could you see that as a spin offs as well?  
**[0:42:51-0:42:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:42:51):**  Like you're going to work, two questions, you're going to work with land you don't own  
**[0:42:56-0:43:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:42:56):**  and have that knowledge of biochar spread and have that literally and have that enhanced  
**[0:43:01-0:43:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:43:01):**  weathering spread beyond your own land and potentially have a lot more impact than you  
**[0:43:05-0:43:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:43:05):**  could have on the land you own?  
**[0:43:06-0:43:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:43:06):**  Is that something you could see happening?  
**[0:43:08-0:43:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:43:08):**  I'm not saying you should be working on it now.  
**[0:43:10-0:43:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:43:10):**  Probably not.  
**[0:43:11-0:43:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:43:11):**  But we're exploring a number of angles to have more impact.  
**[0:43:14-0:43:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:43:14):**  I started this business for impact and try and revisit that on a regular basis as to  
**[0:43:21-0:43:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:43:21):**  whether I'm using my time in the most valuable way to create impact and whether the organization  
**[0:43:27-0:43:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:43:27):**  as a whole is using its time in the most valuable way to create impact.  
**[0:43:32-0:43:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:43:32):**  And sometimes maximizing impact isn't by doing even though we started off as a doing organization.  
**[0:43:40-0:43:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:43:40):**  There's a point in time when sometimes you're better to find a broader way of interacting  
**[0:43:46-0:43:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:43:46):**  with land in this case to have a much bigger impact.  
**[0:43:50-0:43:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:43:50):**  Leverage.  
**[0:43:51-0:43:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:43:51):**  Yes.  
**[0:43:52-0:43:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:43:52):**  It all comes down to leverage.  
**[0:43:53-0:43:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:43:53):**  And sometimes you've got to demonstrate before you've got that leverage and some of the products  
**[0:43:57-0:44:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:43:57):**  perhaps we're at a point where, yes, we want to continue scaling.  
**[0:44:00-0:44:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:44:00):**  Yes, we want to continue enhancing and protecting biodiversity.  
**[0:44:04-0:44:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:44:04):**  And that means operating land.  
**[0:44:07-0:44:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:44:07):**  But some of the other products, perhaps this way we can use our know how, the methodologies  
**[0:44:13-0:44:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:44:13):**  we're developing and things like that to benefit other people as well.  
**[0:44:17-0:44:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:44:17):**  And with that, I think we reach a perfect end of this podcast.  
**[0:44:20-0:44:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:44:20):**  I don't want to take any more of your time because it's very valuable.  
**[0:44:23-0:44:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:44:23):**  I want to thank you so much, Jim, to come on.  
**[0:44:25-0:44:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:44:25):**  And actually, I have one small last question as a small retail investor.  
**[0:44:29-0:44:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:44:29):**  Do you see any I mean, you're talking about institutionals and of course, some of our  
**[0:44:32-0:44:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:44:32):**  pension, I do this often that it's a final question and it's actually not.  
**[0:44:36-0:44:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:44:36):**  But do you see any role potentially for ordinary people putting some of their savings in things  
**[0:44:42-0:44:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:44:42):**  like this?  
**[0:44:43-0:44:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:44:43):**  Or does it have to go through our pension funds and our insurance companies and our  
**[0:44:46-0:44:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:44:46):**  banks, etc.?  
**[0:44:47-0:44:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:44:47):**  Yes.  
**[0:44:48-0:44:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:44:48):**  And I think we've got to find ways of doing that.  
**[0:44:50-0:44:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:44:50):**  And we don't have them today.  
**[0:44:52-0:44:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:44:52):**  Because for the people that are around, like especially the skeptical ones that are nearby,  
**[0:44:56-0:44:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:44:56):**  that would be a great way.  
**[0:44:57-0:45:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:44:57):**  I know many in the energy space, renewable energy space have successfully tackled the  
**[0:45:01-0:45:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:45:01):**  knot in my backyard syndrome by letting people invest in the wind turbine nearby or the solar  
**[0:45:07-0:45:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:45:07):**  systems.  
**[0:45:08-0:45:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:45:08):**  And I think we in the land use space and agriculture space need to do the same.  
**[0:45:12-0:45:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:45:12):**  Plus I really want to as well as a small investor, but I'm just frustrated I can't.  
**[0:45:16-0:45:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:45:16):**  That's just my frustration speaking now.  
**[0:45:17-0:45:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:45:17):**  And is that do you think there are a lot more people like you in that way?  
**[0:45:21-0:45:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:45:21):**  I think so.  
**[0:45:22-0:45:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:45:22):**  I mean, if you look at I follow necessarily just the renewable energy space, the crowd  
**[0:45:27-0:45:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:45:27):**  lending space, for instance, and in the Netherlands, and in Italy as well and some other places,  
**[0:45:32-0:45:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:45:32):**  and you see projects are filling up quickly on the, I would say the right platforms between  
**[0:45:36-0:45:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:45:36):**  records like the ones you that have a track record, etc.  
**[0:45:40-0:45:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:45:40):**  They seem to have a clear lack of projects and put bigger and bigger ones.  
**[0:45:44-0:45:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:45:44):**  I see some 15 million wind parks coming by.  
**[0:45:47-0:45:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:45:47):**  15.  
**[0:45:48-0:45:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:45:48):**  So that's serious.  
**[0:45:49-0:45:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:45:49):**  Not a lot, but it's serious.  
**[0:45:50-0:45:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:45:50):**  It's not a few hundred thousand here and there.  
**[0:45:52-0:45:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:45:52):**  And they fill up and they fill up in a couple of weeks and the smaller ones have a million  
**[0:45:56-0:45:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:45:56):**  or two fill up in less than a day.  
**[0:45:58-0:46:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:45:58):**  And sometimes I'm late if it's like it goes online at 10 in the morning and it's filled  
**[0:46:02-0:46:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:46:02):**  up by five past 10.  
**[0:46:04-0:46:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:46:04):**  And I'm like, wow, okay, there is money for I think two, not four or five, 6%, sometimes  
**[0:46:10-0:46:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:46:10):**  quite securitized, sometimes not.  
**[0:46:12-0:46:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:46:12):**  I mean, it's not the riskier stuff, but there's apparently there's money also from ordinary  
**[0:46:16-0:46:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:46:16):**  folks looking for a return and an impact in this case in the energy space.  
**[0:46:20-0:46:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:46:20):**  So I would say yes, but I hope I'm right in this case.  
**[0:46:24-0:46:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:46:24):**  So where we did explore this and we struggled to find a platform that was easy to work with,  
**[0:46:31-0:46:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:46:31):**  was a reasonable cost on the finance and decided it was easier working with high net worths  
**[0:46:37-0:46:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:46:37):**  at this stage.  
**[0:46:38-0:46:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:46:38):**  I think there's a combi to be made.  
**[0:46:39-0:46:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:46:39):**  Yeah, there's a role for the local crowd or the crowd in general.  
**[0:46:43-0:46:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:46:43):**  And there's a role for high net worth and institutional.  
**[0:46:45-0:46:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:46:45):**  It's I think finding that balance in the dance to make it go fast enough and not have too  
**[0:46:50-0:46:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:46:50):**  much admin and costs, but also make it inclusive enough.  
**[0:46:54-0:46:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:46:54):**  And yeah, it's not an easy one.  
**[0:46:56-0:46:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:46:56):**  And if there's anyone out there with a platform who's listening, who's got a platform that'll  
**[0:46:59-0:47:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:46:59):**  do that, you know, get in touch.  
**[0:47:01-0:47:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:47:01):**  We'd love to try it.  
**[0:47:02-0:47:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:47:02):**  I'd love to democratize the ownership of the land and to allow people to be involved.  
**[0:47:08-0:47:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:47:08):**  That's a whole other podcast we need to do on that.  
**[0:47:10-0:47:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:47:10):**  Yeah.  
**[0:47:11-0:47:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:47:11):**  There's some interesting bits there that we're trying to look at, but it's about focus as  
**[0:47:15-0:47:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:47:15):**  well and trying to keep.  
**[0:47:16-0:47:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:47:16):**  Yeah, no, of course.  
**[0:47:17-0:47:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:47:17):**  I think I mean, we had then Miller of Stewart on the podcast and I think Mimosa, a similar  
**[0:47:22-0:47:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:47:22):**  platform in France, just raised money from Astana, which we didn't have on the podcast  
**[0:47:27-0:47:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:47:27):**  yet.  
**[0:47:28-0:47:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:47:28):**  Eric, if you're listening, we need to get you.  
**[0:47:29-0:47:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:47:29):**  But there are some people exploring the land use space way less than the energy space.  
**[0:47:33-0:47:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:47:33):**  I think we can learn a lot from people there.  
**[0:47:34-0:47:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:47:34):**  And I know people at one, two, three are very interested in the democratization piece as  
**[0:47:40-0:47:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:47:40):**  well.  
**[0:47:41-0:47:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:47:41):**  So there are people thinking about it, but it's like we can open a bank account with  
**[0:47:43-0:47:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:47:43):**  a smartphone in three clicks.  
**[0:47:45-0:47:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:47:45):**  Why can't we not invest in these things?  
**[0:47:47-0:47:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:47:47):**  Yeah, it gets really, really frustrating.  
**[0:47:49-0:47:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:47:49):**  But yeah, we have to figure it out.  
**[0:47:51-0:47:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:47:51):**  And fractional ownership becomes a real problem when you get to property.  
**[0:47:55-0:47:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:47:55):**  But there are tools to do that now.  
**[0:47:56-0:48:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:47:56):**  I think it just needs to right and time commitment to it and focus on it, which might not be  
**[0:48:02-0:48:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:48:02):**  us, which is not now.  
**[0:48:03-0:48:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:48:03):**  No, it's definitely not now.  
**[0:48:05-0:48:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:48:05):**  Perfect.  
**[0:48:06-0:48:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:48:06):**  Thank you so much, Jim, for your time.

**[0:49:06-0:49:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:49:06):**  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[0:49:11-0:49:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:49:11):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  
**[0:49:15-0:49:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:49:15):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[0:49:16-0:49:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:49:16):**  After 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question how to put money  
**[0:49:21-0:49:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:49:21):**  to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011 and recording  
**[0:49:25-0:49:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:49:25):**  this podcast since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  
**[0:49:30-0:49:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:49:30):**  What have we seen in the space over the last years?

**[0:49:53-0:49:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:49:53):**  The soil builders, people working in this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers,

**[0:50:08-0:50:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:50:08):**  People that are building soil at scale.  
**[0:50:10-0:50:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:50:10):**  And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office  
**[0:50:13-0:50:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:50:13):**  or as private individuals or people who are putting other people's money to work through

**[0:50:25-0:50:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:50:25):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:50:27-0:50:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:50:27):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you and I'm very aware  
**[0:50:32-0:50:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:50:32):**  that among the listeners of this podcast we have people with very different means.  
**[0:50:37-0:50:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:50:37):**  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[0:50:42-0:50:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:50:42):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[0:50:45-0:50:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:50:45):**  Thank you.  
**[0:50:46-0:50:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:50:46):**  So what is this course?  
**[0:50:47-0:50:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:50:47):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  
**[0:50:53-0:50:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:50:53):**  so you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:50:55-0:51:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:50:55):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:51:00-0:51:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:51:00):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:51:06-0:51:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:51:06):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[0:51:10-0:51:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:51:10):**  if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:51:12-0:51:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:51:12):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:51:17-0:51:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:51:17):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:51:21-0:51:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:51:21):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:51:26-0:51:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:51:26):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:51:27-0:51:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:51:27):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:51:28-0:51:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:51:28):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:51:31-0:51:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:51:31):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:51:35-0:51:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:51:35):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:51:36-0:51:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:51:36):**  Before making any investment please find professional investment advice.  
**[0:51:42-0:51:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jim-mann#t=0:51:42):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking.

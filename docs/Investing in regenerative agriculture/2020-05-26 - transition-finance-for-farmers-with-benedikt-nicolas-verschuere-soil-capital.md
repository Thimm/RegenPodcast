**[0:00:07-0:00:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:00:07):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:09-0:00:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:00:09):**  In this interview, me and Benedict discuss something rarely covered, which honestly  
**[0:00:13-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:00:13):**  surprises me constantly.  
**[0:00:15-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:00:15):**  The profitability of regenerative and non regenerative farmers.  
**[0:00:18-0:00:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:00:18):**  And does a farmer really need transition finance to start or to speed up their  
**[0:00:23-0:00:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:00:23):**  regenerative transition?  
**[0:00:24-0:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:00:24):**  Find out more about this in the next video.  
**[0:00:26-0:00:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:00:26):**  As we dig deeper, pun definitely intended, into the connection between farm  
**[0:00:30-0:00:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:00:30):**  profitability and regenerative agriculture practices.  
**[0:00:41-0:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:00:41):**  Welcome to investing in regenerative agriculture and food.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:00:44):**  This is a special dedicated series on transition finance.  
**[0:00:48-0:00:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:00:48):**  Why are we recording this video?  
**[0:00:50-0:00:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:00:50):**  Well, because we're going to be talking about the future of agriculture.  
**[0:00:53-0:00:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:00:53):**  This is a dedicated series on transition finance.  
**[0:00:56-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:00:56):**  Why are we recording this series?  
**[0:00:58-0:01:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:00:58):**  Many farmers are ready to speed up their regenerative transition.  
**[0:01:01-0:01:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:01:01):**  They've looked for learning, done the courses, read the key books, hosted the  
**[0:01:05-0:01:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:01:05):**  gurus on their farms, explored farm size regenerative designs, and most  
**[0:01:09-0:01:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:01:09):**  importantly, started their pilots and feedback loops.  
**[0:01:12-0:01:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:01:12):**  This is where transition finance is key.  
**[0:01:15-0:01:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:01:15):**  A local bank loan often isn't feasible because of the short duration, lack of  
**[0:01:19-0:01:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:01:19):**  flexibility and the farmers lack of collateral.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:01:22):**  Furthermore, there's a limit of how much equity a farmer is able or willing to  
**[0:01:26-0:01:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:01:26):**  give away.  
**[0:01:27-0:01:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:01:27):**  That is why my cohost aspiring to be regenerative farmer, Benedict  
**[0:01:32-0:01:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:01:32):**  Boesl, and I are embarking on a journey to find out what are the key principles  
**[0:01:37-0:01:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:01:37):**  of transition finance for regenerative farmers.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:01:40):**  We are interviewing leading practitioners in the regenerative  
**[0:01:43-0:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:01:43):**  agriculture and food finance space.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:01:45):**  They shared our insights, how they would finance the speed up of the regenerative  
**[0:01:49-0:01:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:01:49):**  agriculture and food finance space, and their vision on Benedict's 1000  
**[0:01:54-0:01:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:01:54):**  hectares, which is almost two and a half thousand acres farm in Germany, close to  
**[0:01:58-0:01:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:01:58):**  Berlin.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:01:59):**  This is an open process.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:02:00):**  We are sharing our lessons through the podcast episodes as we go along.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:02:04):**  We don't have the answers yet, just a lot of questions.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:02:06):**  So please share with us any examples of transition finance you've seen, other  
**[0:02:11-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:02:11):**  inspiration, people to interview, et cetera.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:02:13):**  Get in touch via the contact page on the website, investing in regenerative  
**[0:02:17-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:02:17):**  agriculture.com.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:02:20):**  Welcome Nicholas for spirit, the co-founder of soil capital.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:02:23):**  And of course, welcome Benedict Boesl, my cohost.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:02:25):**  Hello.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:02:26):**  Hi, I'm looking forward to this discussion as we are taking it back to the farm and  
**[0:02:31-0:02:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:02:31):**  diving a bit deeper in what a regenerative transition means.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:02:34):**  Both obviously for the farmer Benedict, but also for a lot of farms.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:02:38):**  Our guest has seen in his experience and we're very much looking forward to dive a  
**[0:02:42-0:02:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:02:42):**  bit deeper into that.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:02:43):**  So first of all, I think Nicholas, could you briefly introduce yourself?  
**[0:02:47-0:02:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:02:47):**  And so capital, I mean, we've had you actually in a short interview, which we  
**[0:02:51-0:02:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:02:51):**  recorded live in groundswell last year, which is not happening this year, but just  
**[0:02:54-0:02:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:02:54):**  a brief introduction into your background.  
**[0:02:56-0:03:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:02:56):**  So we know who you are and then we're going to unpack a bit of farming business.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:03:00):**  Yes.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:03:01):**  So I am agronomist and we are based in Belgium.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:03:05):**  I've been passionate about farming since I'm very, very young and I'm involved in,  
**[0:03:11-0:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:03:11):**  in what we call the regenerative agriculture for the last let's say 15, 20  
**[0:03:17-0:03:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:03:17):**  years with my partners here in Belgium, where we are farming, but also now with  
**[0:03:22-0:03:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:03:22):**  the soil capital team that we founded with my colleague, my partner five years ago.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:03:28):**  So basically I'm working in the field as a farmer here in Belgium and as an agronomist  
**[0:03:36-0:03:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:03:36):**  outside of Belgium with a soil capital team.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:03:38):**  And just a brief, I mean, I will share the article you just published or just, I  
**[0:03:43-0:03:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:03:43):**  think a month ago published on farming, profitability, regenerative agriculture  
**[0:03:49-0:03:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:03:49):**  with, with actually a number of farmers that you're working with in Belgium.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:03:52):**  Can you give a very brief stint of where you are now with soil capital?  
**[0:03:56-0:03:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:03:56):**  What is soil capital?  
**[0:03:57-0:03:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:03:57):**  We're speaking April, 2020.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:04:00):**  What is soil capital currently busy with?  
**[0:04:02-0:04:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:04:02):**  We are still focused on how to scale regenerative agriculture across the world.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:04:09):**  If I may say how we can participate to that development.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:04:13):**  We are still involved in several operations, helping farm managers to  
**[0:04:17-0:04:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:04:17):**  transition the farm into regenerative agriculture, Latin America, Europe,  
**[0:04:22-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:04:22):**  a little bit in Africa as well.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:04:24):**  And we are for the last few months, as you were referring to the article we  
**[0:04:28-0:04:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:04:28):**  published a few weeks ago, also trying to explore ways to measure better the way  
**[0:04:36-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:04:36):**  farmers are performing economically.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:04:39):**  And also with another indicator, which is the carbon to understand how the farmers  
**[0:04:44-0:04:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:04:44):**  are able to transition their farm economically and also regarding the  
**[0:04:48-0:04:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:04:48):**  carbon balance, we are now working on the tool to help farmers and agronomists to  
**[0:04:53-0:04:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:04:53):**  understand where they are and how they can improve, how they can grow their  
**[0:04:57-0:05:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:04:57):**  farm, how they can improve, how they can benchmark themselves against the local  
**[0:05:01-0:05:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:05:01):**  community and how to give them guidelines to transition their farm.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:05:05):**  So that's one of the focus for the moment with part of the team.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:05:10):**  And if I remember correctly from the article, there was a very interesting  
**[0:05:13-0:05:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:05:13):**  connection, not saying correlation, but connection between the profitability  
**[0:05:18-0:05:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:05:18):**  and the carbon levels, like the farms that had the highest carbon levels in  
**[0:05:22-0:05:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:05:22):**  their soil also were the most profitable.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:05:24):**  The two are connected, but we don't know what causes what or what other  
**[0:05:29-0:05:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:05:29):**  variables are at play, but at least it shows that the question that everybody  
**[0:05:32-0:05:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:05:32):**  asks constantly, can this be done profitably?  
**[0:05:35-0:05:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:05:35):**  Yeah.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:05:35):**  So this is really our guideline at Soil Capital.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:05:39):**  We are strongly convinced that we can farm more profitably while doing good for  
**[0:05:46-0:05:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:05:46):**  nature and storing carbon in the soil.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:05:49):**  It is clear that this is maybe not the easiest way, but what shows the first  
**[0:05:55-0:06:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:05:55):**  results now with around 50, 60 farms that we are working with and that we're  
**[0:06:00-0:06:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:06:00):**  analyzing with this tool is that most of the time, the farms who are the most  
**[0:06:05-0:06:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:06:05):**  profitable are also the most successful at sequestering carbon.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:06:11):**  It's not always the case, but it means that there are ways to do it.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:06:15):**  And this is where we are really interested.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:06:17):**  We want to understand better those farms.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:06:19):**  We want to also to make those techniques, those examples available for the others.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:06:25):**  Let me just jump in there real quick, because I think this is such a crucial  
**[0:06:29-0:06:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:06:29):**  point you mentioned, you know, the question always is if it's so good and  
**[0:06:33-0:06:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:06:33):**  valuable, why isn't everyone doing it?  
**[0:06:36-0:06:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:06:36):**  From the experience that you have speaking to so many farmers, what would  
**[0:06:39-0:06:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:06:39):**  you say, what are like the biggest barriers to entry for those farmers  
**[0:06:44-0:06:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:06:44):**  starting the transition to more regenerative ways, let's say?  
**[0:06:48-0:06:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:06:48):**  I think that there are many reasons, but the main reason for me and for us at  
**[0:06:53-0:06:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:06:53):**  Sol Capital, it's the money, the profitability.  
**[0:06:56-0:07:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:06:56):**  I think that the most of the farmers in Europe or in the other continents are  
**[0:07:01-0:07:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:07:01):**  struggling, the margin are very thin.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:07:05):**  And so any additional risk or additional changes that you bring to the farm is  
**[0:07:11-0:07:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:07:11):**  putting a high risk on the margin, on the salary of the farmer.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:07:15):**  And so this is why we really believed that there is a strong connection  
**[0:07:20-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:07:20):**  between the capability of a farmer to change and the guarantee or his  
**[0:07:26-0:07:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:07:26):**  capability also to generate more revenue, more margin, more profit.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:07:31):**  For me, it's a big bottleneck.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:07:32):**  So we are working mostly on the farm and not on the market.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:07:37):**  So we believe that farmer and the farming operation can be transitioned  
**[0:07:42-0:07:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:07:42):**  into regenerative agriculture only if the economics are improved from day one.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:07:48):**  We already discussed that with Koon a few times, and if we want to scale  
**[0:07:52-0:07:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:07:52):**  this kind of farming practices, we need to find ways to make it profitable  
**[0:07:58-0:07:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:07:58):**  on a very short term.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:07:59):**  And we can discuss that after, if you want to understand how to make it.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:08:03):**  Yeah, I think that would be great.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:08:04):**  I mean, people would listen to this and say, yeah, but you just said  
**[0:08:07-0:08:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:08:07):**  their profitability is so low.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:08:08):**  Now, farmers on most continents you're working on are struggling.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:08:13):**  The margins are very thin in depth in this policy changes,  
**[0:08:16-0:08:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:08:16):**  a lot of different things.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:08:18):**  So if we don't wait for a market to change in the sense that we start  
**[0:08:22-0:08:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:08:22):**  paying more for certain types of regenerative grain or certain types,  
**[0:08:26-0:08:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:08:26):**  which is a lot of discussions are happening on that space, you say, okay,  
**[0:08:29-0:08:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:08:29):**  let's take it as a given that that's not happening yet, or it would be great  
**[0:08:31-0:08:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:08:31):**  if it does, but we cannot control that.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:08:33):**  So how then do you transition a farmer that is struggling that might be  
**[0:08:38-0:08:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:08:38):**  listening to this or somebody that knows a farmer that is listening to this?  
**[0:08:41-0:08:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:08:41):**  What are the steps?  
**[0:08:42-0:08:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:08:42):**  What are the first steps you obviously generalizing?  
**[0:08:44-0:08:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:08:44):**  Because it depends on the context, but what are central things you  
**[0:08:48-0:08:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:08:48):**  themes you always see coming back?  
**[0:08:50-0:08:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:08:50):**  If you work with a farmer in Argentina or you work with a farmer in Belgium?  
**[0:08:53-0:08:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:08:53):**  Nicholas, before you answer this question, let me just jump in right there,  
**[0:08:56-0:09:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:08:56):**  because there's one overall question that lies basically above this.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:09:01):**  And it's a, you can only answer the yes or no, please.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:09:04):**  This is the task, but everything considered, we just said, and what you're  
**[0:09:09-0:09:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:09:09):**  going to answer respective questions.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:09:12):**  Do you think, do you believe farmers need transition finance?  
**[0:09:17-0:09:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:09:17):**  Yes or no?  
**[0:09:18-0:09:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:09:18):**  No.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:09:19):**  That's what I was hearing.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:09:21):**  You might say, but no, that's the central theme of the podcast.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:09:25):**  We're not saying you're sure if you take it probably because we do a,  
**[0:09:29-0:09:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:09:29):**  a podcast series on transition finance, because it is a question  
**[0:09:33-0:09:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:09:33):**  that is my concern as well.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:09:36):**  You know, there's, I have two hearts in my chest if you want, but Nicholas,  
**[0:09:39-0:09:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:09:39):**  I'd be really interested to hear what, how you would answer questions, because  
**[0:09:43-0:09:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:09:43):**  I think they're very really fundamental.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:09:45):**  But I just wanted to get that one out.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:09:46):**  You pushed me to answer one word and of course this is impossible.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:09:49):**  This is very restrictive.  
**[0:09:51-0:09:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:09:51):**  I would say that on my end, I strongly believe that you can  
**[0:09:54-0:09:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:09:54):**  transition without extended finance.  
**[0:09:56-0:09:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:09:56):**  That's more.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:09:57):**  The answer we also understand that if you want to transition massively and fast,  
**[0:10:02-0:10:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:10:02):**  that money is necessary to push, to help farmers who don't have the enough  
**[0:10:08-0:10:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:10:08):**  confidence, enough support, enough whatever.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:10:10):**  So yeah, you understand behind this answer.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:10:14):**  So what would be the steps then if let's say, let's take it as a given that  
**[0:10:17-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:10:17):**  hypothetical farmer doesn't want to take or cannot take, or is not confident to  
**[0:10:22-0:10:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:10:22):**  take outside capital, which is not a good idea, but it's not a good idea to  
**[0:10:26-0:10:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:10:26):**  take, what's your approach again, depending on the context, but what are  
**[0:10:30-0:10:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:10:30):**  some, some general approaches you usually use?  
**[0:10:33-0:10:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:10:33):**  Yeah, I think that it's also coming from maybe from the character of the farmers  
**[0:10:38-0:10:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:10:38):**  who are normally very independent and self-sustaining.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:10:42):**  And this is why we are coming from this world also.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:10:45):**  And this is why there is a big part of myself who hate to be supported by  
**[0:10:51-0:10:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:10:51):**  somebody else to transition, to do something, to develop your own business,  
**[0:10:55-0:10:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:10:55):**  to make changes.  
**[0:10:57-0:11:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:10:57):**  So we've been educated with the subsidy from the European Union  
**[0:11:01-0:11:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:11:01):**  and we see where we are now.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:11:02):**  So this massive amount of money that has been spent with, on my view, not enough  
**[0:11:06-0:11:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:11:06):**  changes and nearly no changes on the ground.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:11:10):**  So this is why I'm afraid when you talk about financing external  
**[0:11:14-0:11:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:11:14):**  hands coming to help the farmer.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:11:16):**  And this is why our reflex in our company at the beginning and still now is always  
**[0:11:22-0:11:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:11:22):**  what are the internal solutions that we can find in the farm with the farmer,  
**[0:11:29-0:11:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:11:29):**  with an independent agronomist, helping the farmer to think and to work on the  
**[0:11:35-0:11:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:11:35):**  business more than in the business.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:11:37):**  And the main lever that we have today are the agrochemicals and the external inputs  
**[0:11:42-0:11:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:11:42):**  that are purchased by the farmers.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:11:45):**  And in most of the farm that we are working with, I would say  
**[0:11:49-0:11:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:11:49):**  that this is always the case.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:11:51):**  There is an overuse, it's maybe not the right word, but the usage of this  
**[0:11:57-0:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:11:57):**  external input, the inputs that are purchased by the farmers are not efficient.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:12:03):**  And this is where you can start tapping into trying to get additional dollars or  
**[0:12:09-0:12:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:12:09):**  euro, recovering some additional euros and dollars to start financing your own  
**[0:12:14-0:12:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:12:14):**  transition.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:12:15):**  So agrochemicals or external inputs are the first one where you can, from our  
**[0:12:20-0:12:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:12:20):**  experience, start saving some money.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:12:23):**  Yeah, I think it's a crucial point you're making.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:12:25):**  Many farmers, I mean, there are two very crucial points.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:12:28):**  First of all, is that independent agronomists and obviously that's connected  
**[0:12:32-0:12:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:12:32):**  to the input because they are selling that in many countries, some countries  
**[0:12:35-0:12:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:12:35):**  that's actually, they're starting to decouple that, but many farmers, when we  
**[0:12:40-0:12:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:12:40):**  talk about farmers, we never talk about their agronomists, but many times they are  
**[0:12:43-0:12:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:12:43):**  a team.  
**[0:12:44-0:12:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:12:44):**  And if the farmer wants to do something and the agronomist doesn't agree or the  
**[0:12:47-0:12:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:12:47):**  other way around, it's very difficult to get any changes.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:12:49):**  And if you don't have an independent agronomist, obviously they must be paid  
**[0:12:53-0:12:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:12:53):**  by someone, meaning they're paid by the input companies.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:12:56):**  And I always see it as, I don't know, Shell or any other oil companies going to  
**[0:13:00-0:13:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:13:00):**  help me save petrol or like, look, we're selling you something that you're going  
**[0:13:05-0:13:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:13:05):**  to use less of that probably doesn't happen.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:13:07):**  So that means that there's extra space.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:13:10):**  Like they're selling you extra inputs if they want it or not, then maybe they use  
**[0:13:12-0:13:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:13:12):**  a recipe that's not perfect for your farm.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:13:15):**  So you're saying there is always space or they seem to be usually space in  
**[0:13:19-0:13:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:13:19):**  the inputs that are coming into the farm.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:13:20):**  And that's the first lever you have to reduce that without hurting your yields  
**[0:13:26-0:13:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:13:26):**  and thus reducing your costs basically directly and thus having some extra  
**[0:13:29-0:13:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:13:29):**  space, some extra margin, some extra money in the bank that you can use for, for  
**[0:13:33-0:13:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:13:33):**  pilots, for your regenerative transition financed by yourself.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:13:37):**  Right.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:13:37):**  I think you're explaining that much better than me.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:13:41):**  There is another point also, because to convince a farmer that he could use his  
**[0:13:45-0:13:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:13:45):**  inputs more efficiently, it's tough because there is in general, a relationship  
**[0:13:50-0:13:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:13:50):**  of dependency or trust also history between the farmer and his advisor.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:13:58):**  And the farmers, because he's in a risky situation in a very low margin business,  
**[0:14:04-0:14:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:14:04):**  he has is in general, very reluctant to change any of the  
**[0:14:08-0:14:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:14:08):**  ingredients that he has around him.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:14:10):**  He knows that if he's changing something, there is a high risk that the plus  
**[0:14:14-0:14:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:14:14):**  five percent of margin or the plus three percent of margin he's doing will be  
**[0:14:18-0:14:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:14:18):**  transformed into a minus two or three or five very quickly.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:14:22):**  So by definition in a situation where he's afraid to change any of those  
**[0:14:28-0:14:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:14:28):**  ingredients, and one of the things, this is why we are working now focusing on  
**[0:14:33-0:14:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:14:33):**  dashboard on metrics more than ever is that the farmers in terms of economic  
**[0:14:39-0:14:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:14:39):**  doesn't have a clear view on what's happening on the farm.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:14:42):**  The farm is a complex system with a lot of interactions and the farmer is also  
**[0:14:47-0:14:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:14:47):**  super busy at making the operation going well.  
**[0:14:51-0:14:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:14:51):**  The paperwork has been increased more and more the last few years.  
**[0:14:55-0:15:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:14:55):**  So there are a lot of farmers who doesn't know about their production costs.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:15:00):**  They know about the yields, they know about the accurate, they know about many  
**[0:15:04-0:15:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:15:04):**  things, but when it comes to calculate and to really understand the production  
**[0:15:07-0:15:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:15:07):**  costs and to with the idea to benchmark that and to have a discussion with others  
**[0:15:13-0:15:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:15:13):**  to understand where they are, to understand where they can improve, it's very rare.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:15:17):**  And so this is where we are working now, trying to define and to help the farmer  
**[0:15:22-0:15:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:15:22):**  to understand better his figures, economical figures first and operational figures after.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:15:29):**  But could you go a bit more into depth to the actual discussion you have with the  
**[0:15:35-0:15:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:15:35):**  farmer, basically you drive on the farm, you have a tour, you discuss certain  
**[0:15:39-0:15:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:15:39):**  things and try to get a feeling and understanding of the process and system  
**[0:15:43-0:15:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:15:43):**  that that particular farmer is running.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:15:46):**  But how is the talk developing between the two of you?  
**[0:15:49-0:15:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:15:49):**  How are you trying to convince them?  
**[0:15:51-0:15:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:15:51):**  How are you trying to change his thinking?  
**[0:15:53-0:15:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:15:53):**  Because I mean, this is what in the end of the day is, right?  
**[0:15:56-0:16:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:15:56):**  I mean, you can tell him, look, you can really reduce this and that, and this  
**[0:16:00-0:16:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:16:00):**  might have this or that effect, but doesn't he really have to kind of experience  
**[0:16:04-0:16:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:16:04):**  it and see it and live through it in order to then be open to changing  
**[0:16:08-0:16:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:16:08):**  you or taking that risk.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:16:10):**  Can you explain a bit more on that, the actual process of talking and  
**[0:16:13-0:16:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:16:13):**  communicating with the farm and convincing, I guess?  
**[0:16:16-0:16:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:16:16):**  Yeah.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:16:16):**  So maybe we are fortunate for the moment to work with farmers who are coming to us  
**[0:16:23-0:16:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:16:23):**  with this first step of being convinced that something has to be done is already done.  
**[0:16:29-0:16:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:16:29):**  Is this already achieved?  
**[0:16:30-0:16:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:16:30):**  Thanks to people like Coon or others, we're trying to explain and to communicate  
**[0:16:37-0:16:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:16:37):**  to farmers and other people of the community, what's happening and the benefit.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:16:40):**  There are now more and more people who are questioning their system.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:16:43):**  So I think that's one thing.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:16:45):**  Step one is done.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:16:46):**  Yeah.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:16:47):**  Something needs to change, but then the question is what and how?  
**[0:16:50-0:16:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:16:50):**  Yeah.  
**[0:16:50-0:16:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:16:50):**  Most of the time we don't have to preach and then start convincing.  
**[0:16:53-0:16:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:16:53):**  Luckily, because that's very tiring.  
**[0:16:55-0:16:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:16:55):**  Yeah.  
**[0:16:55-0:17:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:16:55):**  But it doesn't mean that it's easy because as I was saying, the economical situation,  
**[0:17:00-0:17:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:17:00):**  balance of the farm is most of the time, I would say always very tight.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:17:05):**  So the margin is not important.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:17:08):**  But again, the first discussion that we have with the farmer, it's a very simple  
**[0:17:14-0:17:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:17:14):**  discussion about economics and say, okay, you know about the principle  
**[0:17:17-0:17:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:17:17):**  of regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:17:19):**  We know that we have to limit the tillage.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:17:20):**  We know that we have to cover the soil and blah, blah, blah.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:17:23):**  This is quite clear for everybody.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:17:25):**  How can we start implementing some of those principles into your farm  
**[0:17:30-0:17:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:17:30):**  without adding additional costs?  
**[0:17:33-0:17:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:17:33):**  And one of the principles of the regenerative agriculture, again, it's  
**[0:17:38-0:17:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:17:38):**  trying to decrease, to optimise the usage of agrochemical.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:17:41):**  We know that fungicide, insecticides in particular, are  
**[0:17:45-0:17:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:17:45):**  damageable for the soil and the ecosystem and the biodiversity.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:17:50):**  So this is the first discussion we have.  
**[0:17:53-0:17:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:17:53):**  What sort of fungicide, what sort of insecticides are you using on your farm?  
**[0:17:57-0:18:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:17:57):**  And as I was saying just before, this is the first way to optimise because I can  
**[0:18:02-0:18:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:18:02):**  say that in most of the case, we can start saving by just using those  
**[0:18:08-0:18:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:18:08):**  input better between 10 and 30, 40% of those agrochemicals.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:18:14):**  So that's the first step.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:18:15):**  So just to summarise, you're saying that most farms you need to  
**[0:18:19-0:18:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:18:19):**  meet are overusing or not using efficiently.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:18:22):**  So they could save between 10 and 30 to 40% of their chemical input,  
**[0:18:28-0:18:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:18:28):**  insecticides and fungicide, which is a lot of money because that's cash  
**[0:18:31-0:18:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:18:31):**  out of the door in a second, basically.  
**[0:18:34-0:18:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:18:34):**  And these are farmers that are already aware of soil, et cetera.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:18:36):**  So they're probably not even the ones that are wasting the most.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:18:39):**  And it's coming from different factors.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:18:40):**  So you have first the way you're using the pesticides.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:18:43):**  And I know that it can be shocking for people listening about regenerative  
**[0:18:47-0:18:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:18:47):**  agriculture wants to go into regenerative agriculture, who have been  
**[0:18:50-0:18:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:18:50):**  inspired by Kuhn and the other.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:18:53):**  The first discussion you have with an agronomist from South  
**[0:18:55-0:18:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:18:55):**  Capital is to talk about the fungicide.  
**[0:18:58-0:18:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:18:58):**  That's reality.  
**[0:18:58-0:18:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:18:58):**  That's where we start.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:18:59):**  And the quality of application, the way you're applying pesticides is definitely  
**[0:19:04-0:19:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:19:04):**  one of the big factors to improve it.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:19:06):**  You would be surprised to see, to understand how many farmers today  
**[0:19:10-0:19:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:19:10):**  want to change, doesn't really, haven't been informed that the  
**[0:19:16-0:19:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:19:16):**  are ways to apply those chemicals where you can really save quantity.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:19:20):**  The quality of the water you're using, the climate when you're applying the type  
**[0:19:25-0:19:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:19:25):**  of molecule that are not always the same.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:19:28):**  That's one thing.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:19:29):**  The second thing is the way they are purchasing because most of the farmers  
**[0:19:32-0:19:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:19:32):**  are working on a very individual base.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:19:36):**  So they are not negotiating their price.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:19:39):**  They are buying alone and they're not using the group effect, the group power  
**[0:19:44-0:19:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:19:44):**  to buy in a more efficient way.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:19:46):**  So we are also trying to, in places like Belgium, for example, where we have  
**[0:19:50-0:19:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:19:50):**  more farmers or in other places, to group the farmers together, to try  
**[0:19:55-0:19:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:19:55):**  to help them to buy better, because this is nothing to do with the  
**[0:19:59-0:20:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:19:59):**  regenerative agriculture principle, but this is also a good way  
**[0:20:03-0:20:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:20:03):**  to start saving some money.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:20:06):**  And connecting the farmers to each other.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:20:08):**  Yeah.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:20:08):**  Connecting the farmers around one vision.  
**[0:20:10-0:20:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:20:10):**  And by the way, you can also connect farmers in this case, who are not  
**[0:20:13-0:20:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:20:13):**  interested about regenerative agriculture, but who are coming to you because  
**[0:20:17-0:20:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:20:17):**  they are interested just to save money.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:20:19):**  And this is a, probably you create a good momentum to start discussing,  
**[0:20:23-0:20:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:20:23):**  not only about pesticides and tenders and group purchase, but  
**[0:20:27-0:20:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:20:27):**  talking about soil and soil.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:20:29):**  And that's a second way to save money.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:20:31):**  And once you've saved your 20 to 60, 70 euro per hectare in a grain  
**[0:20:38-0:20:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:20:38):**  operation or in Argentina or in Belgium, France, or even in Africa,  
**[0:20:44-0:20:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:20:44):**  you start collecting some money.  
**[0:20:45-0:20:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:20:45):**  You have a budget to start investing for the longer term.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:20:48):**  And the longer term for me is your cover crop.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:20:51):**  That's one thing that the farmers generally don't want to step in  
**[0:20:54-0:20:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:20:54):**  because it's an additional cost.  
**[0:20:56-0:20:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:20:56):**  So most of the time they're just following the rules, the local  
**[0:20:59-0:21:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:20:59):**  legislation, okay, I'm going to do a very, I'm forced in Europe to  
**[0:21:05-0:21:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:21:05):**  plant some cover crops, so I'm going to do some mustard, five kilo per  
**[0:21:08-0:21:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:21:08):**  hectare, 10 euros per hectare.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:21:10):**  And it's going to be, I'm going to be okay with the legislation, but  
**[0:21:14-0:21:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:21:14):**  they will have no effect on the soil.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:21:17):**  And with this additional money, you can, you can convince the farmers, okay,  
**[0:21:21-0:21:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:21:21):**  let's invest a part of your saving that we just achieved with your chemicals  
**[0:21:26-0:21:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:21:26):**  into a better cover crop, because this is something that will pay in the coming year.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:21:32):**  And maybe let's do it really seriously.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:21:36):**  And let's do it only on 10% of your average with a very good multi-species  
**[0:21:42-0:21:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:21:42):**  cover crop so that we push the, we increase the chance to really have a  
**[0:21:48-0:21:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:21:48):**  fast payback and fast observation that you can see in the fields.  
**[0:21:54-0:21:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:21:54):**  And that's a second step.  
**[0:21:57-0:22:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:21:57):**  Another part of this longer term discussion is the  
**[0:22:01-0:22:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:22:01):**  term, this effect is also to start talking with the farmers about the rotation.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:22:08):**  And most of the farmers are not producing some crop that are less profitable.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:22:13):**  And with an additional budget that you're creating with these input savings, you  
**[0:22:19-0:22:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:22:19):**  can, you can convince also the farmers, okay, let's start producing again, some  
**[0:22:24-0:22:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:22:24):**  oats or some barley or some legumes that you were not producing for the last  
**[0:22:32-0:22:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:22:32):**  few years, because it's not the most profitable crop on the short term.  
**[0:22:37-0:22:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:22:37):**  And let's reintroduce some of those crops on one hectare, five hectare, 10  
**[0:22:41-0:22:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:22:41):**  hectares just to understand that those crops, this additional crop will have  
**[0:22:49-0:22:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:22:49):**  an effect also on your soil and on your production costs on the longer term.  
**[0:22:54-0:23:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:22:54):**  So that's the way to prime the pump and to step into the journey of regenerative farming.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:23:03):**  And the good news is that in most of the case, the farmer after one year, one  
**[0:23:12-0:23:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:23:12):**  year and a half, two years, when the pump is starting to work, you don't  
**[0:23:20-0:23:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:23:20):**  need to push them anymore.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:23:21):**  They start seeing more clearly than us where their system is going.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:23:29):**  And most of the time they will come back to you and say, okay, actually I've  
**[0:23:33-0:23:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:23:33):**  increased before you asked me the acreage of cover crop, I've started to share  
**[0:23:40-0:23:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:23:40):**  some equipment with my neighbour.  
**[0:23:41-0:23:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:23:41):**  And the motivation is coming back.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:23:44):**  So that's a general average observation that we have with the different clients.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:23:49):**  Yeah.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:23:50):**  I mean, thank you for that.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:23:51):**  I think that was quite interesting because it shows the different ways to go at it.  
**[0:23:55-0:23:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:23:55):**  You mentioned long-term.  
**[0:23:57-0:24:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:23:57):**  So when you talk about that transition phase, what kind of time span are you thinking of?  
**[0:24:03-0:24:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:24:03):**  This is really a discussion and a depending of the people.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:24:07):**  Because you have many farmers who are, as I was saying, not able to transition  
**[0:24:17-0:24:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:24:17):**  fast because they don't want to increase the risk.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:24:20):**  They don't have the money.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:24:22):**  So in this case, the long-term is, I would say between three, five, seven years where  
**[0:24:34-0:24:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:24:34):**  you can really say, okay, I've been, now I'm really ticking the boxes of all the  
**[0:24:42-0:24:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:24:42):**  principles of regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:24:47):**  Even if it's not binary, there is always, it's always a little bit blur, but you can  
**[0:24:53-0:24:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:24:53):**  agree that you are into this system.  
**[0:24:56-0:25:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:24:56):**  Some other farmers we are working with are more interested to go faster because they  
**[0:25:08-0:25:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:25:08):**  want to finance that themselves.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:25:11):**  So they say, okay, I understand that I'm putting my operation with a high risk.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:25:17):**  I'm ready to finance that.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:25:18):**  And this is maybe where external finance or additional farmers finance can help.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:25:28):**  And then you can go faster.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:25:31):**  And I would say in three years, you can probably make big steps in this transition.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:25:39):**  I would say that our preference in the soil capital environment ecosystem is to go, as  
**[0:25:48-0:25:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:25:48):**  I was saying, without external finance, without having the farmer forced to tap into  
**[0:25:57-0:26:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:25:57):**  savings, without having the farmers forced to take a high risk.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:26:02):**  Because, yeah, of course, there are many risks around the farm, the farming system, the  
**[0:26:10-0:26:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:26:10):**  climate is there, the market as well.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:26:13):**  And if you're not in the right moment, you can really take a serious hit if you want to  
**[0:26:23-0:26:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:26:23):**  go too fast.  
**[0:26:26-0:26:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:26:26):**  So, yeah, I don't know if I answered your question, but let's say three, five years.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:26:30):**  And what we have to remember, I think, is that we don't accept the fact that those three,  
**[0:26:40-0:26:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:26:40):**  five years would be years with less profitability than the year minus one, minus two, minus  
**[0:26:49-0:26:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:26:49):**  three.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:26:49):**  So that's the main role for us.  
**[0:26:53-0:26:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:26:53):**  I think this is so crucial.  
**[0:26:54-0:27:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:26:54):**  And you mentioned early on that it's also about developing KPIs and having strong numbers  
**[0:27:01-0:27:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:27:01):**  to relate to and to go back to and to analyze throughout a certain time span throughout  
**[0:27:06-0:27:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:27:06):**  that transition.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:27:07):**  Because the thing is, how do you define success after a couple of years?  
**[0:27:11-0:27:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:27:11):**  I mean, obviously, you have a shovel and you will probably hopefully see.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:27:14):**  But on the economic side, if farmers are not that aware of the economics, especially  
**[0:27:20-0:27:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:27:20):**  regarding production costs, how can they actually tell?  
**[0:27:24-0:27:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:27:24):**  Obviously, other than what they see outside.  
**[0:27:27-0:27:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:27:27):**  And I think because what we often come across when we have visitors here, we give them  
**[0:27:31-0:27:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:27:31):**  a farm tour basically and look at some of those agroforestry systems.  
**[0:27:35-0:27:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:27:35):**  And most of the farmers often come around the area and they are all aware of the problems  
**[0:27:40-0:27:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:27:40):**  that we have regarding drought, regarding erosion, wind erosion, water erosion, extreme  
**[0:27:46-0:27:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:27:46):**  weather conditions.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:27:47):**  And nearly all of them say, well, I think agroforestry is amazing.  
**[0:27:50-0:27:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:27:50):**  I think there's a huge potential there.  
**[0:27:52-0:27:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:27:52):**  But none of them will ever start implementing anything if they don't have reliable calculations  
**[0:27:58-0:27:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:27:58):**  to work with.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:27:59):**  So I think it's so crucial.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:28:00):**  And in the beginning, you spoke about scaling regenerative ag.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:28:04):**  And I mean, this is why Kun and me are doing this, because we believe we have to and we  
**[0:28:09-0:28:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:28:09):**  need to, and this could be a part of it.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:28:11):**  But the question is the whole, the scientific as well as the numeric, how do you say, monitoring  
**[0:28:19-0:28:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:28:19):**  of those processes is, I don't know how you see that, but then sometimes it's coming a  
**[0:28:24-0:28:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:28:24):**  bit short.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:28:25):**  So we need those reliable numbers.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:28:27):**  So I think thinking about KPIs, thinking about ways of actually making that transition somehow  
**[0:28:33-0:28:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:28:33):**  be reflected in numbers and experiences.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:28:36):**  I think that's going to be so crucial for the next couple of development phases, I guess.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:28:41):**  Yes.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:28:41):**  And on that point, I come back on what we're trying to develop now, this tool that we've  
**[0:28:47-0:28:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:28:47):**  called Mysore Capital.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:28:50):**  I will link to it below in the show notes for anybody who wants to check it out.  
**[0:28:54-0:29:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:28:54):**  It came from a frustration, internal frustration as well, to not being able to monitor ourselves  
**[0:29:01-0:29:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:29:01):**  and to also to increase our capability to convince farmers and to drive farmers in the  
**[0:29:10-0:29:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:29:10):**  right direction.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:29:11):**  So it is a tool for the agronomist, mostly for the farm manager.  
**[0:29:17-0:29:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:29:17):**  And we've decided to oversimplify today the system and the KPIs to talk, as I was saying  
**[0:29:26-0:29:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:29:26):**  first, about the cost of production and to analyze where it's good, where it's not good,  
**[0:29:32-0:29:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:29:32):**  where you can improve compared to your peers.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:29:35):**  And the second part is the carbon.  
**[0:29:37-0:29:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:29:37):**  And we believe that today, in a very simplistic way, all the different KPIs of the regenerative  
**[0:29:44-0:29:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:29:44):**  agriculture principle could be summarized in this carbon balance.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:29:51):**  We believe today it's very restrictive.  
**[0:29:55-0:29:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:29:55):**  I agree.  
**[0:29:55-0:30:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:29:55):**  And we are working on other metrics to make that a little bit more complete.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:30:05):**  But we believe that if you do a carbon balance of the farm at feed level, you will have a  
**[0:30:13-0:30:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:30:13):**  very good idea of how many tons of carbon you're sequestering in your soil, basically,  
**[0:30:18-0:30:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:30:18):**  because this is the only way for the farmer to sequester.  
**[0:30:22-0:30:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:30:22):**  You have also, with the carbon balance, a quite good idea of what sort of intensity,  
**[0:30:28-0:30:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:30:28):**  in terms of input, nitrogen use, external nitrogen you're using.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:30:33):**  So we believe that it's a good metric.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:30:35):**  And this is, as you were saying, Benedict, I think we see this kind of tool of metric  
**[0:30:48-0:30:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:30:48):**  very necessary to go faster, to limit the risk as well, to be able to communicate, to  
**[0:30:59-0:31:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:30:59):**  be able to talk with your neighbor, to compare yourself with others, and just much better  
**[0:31:05-0:31:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:31:05):**  than, of course, counting the earthworms or doing a tour of the farm with your neighbor,  
**[0:31:12-0:31:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:31:12):**  which is very important as well, maybe to start the journey.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:31:17):**  But we also have to understand that today there are many farmers who understand the  
**[0:31:24-0:31:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:31:24):**  principles or even very conventional farmers who know that, but they don't know where they  
**[0:31:32-0:31:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:31:32):**  are.  
**[0:31:33-0:31:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:31:33):**  They don't know.  
**[0:31:34-0:31:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:31:34):**  And year after year, they see this transition in three, four, five, seven years.  
**[0:31:41-0:31:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:31:41):**  And it's very important that the farmer can year after year understand that he made a  
**[0:31:46-0:31:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:31:46):**  few percentage of effort there.  
**[0:31:48-0:31:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:31:48):**  And there is a few kilos of nitrogen more and of CO2 more sequestered and a few euros  
**[0:31:56-0:31:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:31:56):**  saved on the other part.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:31:57):**  And I think that we need to see, we believe that we need to see to be much more granular  
**[0:32:08-0:32:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:32:08):**  in the future to accompany these farmers into this transition.  
**[0:32:14-0:32:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:32:14):**  Yeah.  
**[0:32:14-0:32:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:32:14):**  And you said something very interesting there.  
**[0:32:15-0:32:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:32:15):**  I mean, a lot of very interesting points, but the peer part, because it's so far, I  
**[0:32:20-0:32:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:32:20):**  mean, people can come to, can visit a farm, do a farm tour, visit Benedict or somebody  
**[0:32:25-0:32:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:32:25):**  else that has been doing pieces of the regenerative transition is increasing cover crops, et cetera.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:32:30):**  But if you can see that your neighbor or somebody down the road who has very similar weather,  
**[0:32:35-0:32:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:32:35):**  obviously, unless you have an enormous farm, maybe in Australia, but it's doing much better  
**[0:32:40-0:32:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:32:40):**  financially with just between brackets, because it's obviously not just, but just a different  
**[0:32:45-0:32:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:32:45):**  management and actually being financially much more profitable.  
**[0:32:50-0:32:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:32:50):**  Normally, maybe you would have seen it because somebody bought a new car, et cetera.  
**[0:32:53-0:32:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:32:53):**  But if you can actually benchmark yourself with somebody down the road, that is in the  
**[0:32:57-0:33:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:32:57):**  same system as you are the same context, how powerful is that?  
**[0:33:00-0:33:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:33:00):**  Can you explain a bit that peer part of this journey?  
**[0:33:03-0:33:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:33:03):**  Yeah.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:33:05):**  Again, it starts from the farm and the fact that the farmers are for me too isolated  
**[0:33:12-0:33:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:33:12):**  because of many reasons, the workload, the fact that they are independent and the land  
**[0:33:25-0:33:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:33:25):**  also competition with the neighbors.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:33:28):**  So most of the farmers will not easily discuss about figures like economic.  
**[0:33:35-0:33:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:33:35):**  No, they discuss about yield.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:33:37):**  Everybody's always like, I did that, but nobody ever discusses the cost part to that.  
**[0:33:40-0:33:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:33:40):**  Yeah, and I think it's difficult to share that kind of information with your neighbor.  
**[0:33:46-0:33:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:33:46):**  Mostly if you're trying to hope that you can buy the land of the neighbor in the future,  
**[0:33:55-0:34:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:33:55):**  because there is so much competition on the land, that's another discussion,  
**[0:34:00-0:34:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:34:00):**  but I think it's coming also from the system and the way we are farming.  
**[0:34:04-0:34:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:34:04):**  So how do you overcome that, that fear of sharing my profitability or my numbers?  
**[0:34:08-0:34:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:34:08):**  Just by in this tool, just by aggregating the results of the neighbor, the data are protected.  
**[0:34:16-0:34:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:34:16):**  So you can see the results of your farm because that's part of the exercise.  
**[0:34:22-0:34:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:34:22):**  And together with the results of your farm, you're going to see the average of the farmers  
**[0:34:30-0:34:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:34:30):**  of your region.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:34:32):**  And you can define the perimeter if you want to have a close radius or bigger radius.  
**[0:34:37-0:34:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:34:37):**  And also we've extracted the best 25% in terms of cost of production.  
**[0:34:45-0:34:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:34:45):**  So you're going to see that as well.  
**[0:34:46-0:34:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:34:46):**  But you don't know which one it is.  
**[0:34:48-0:34:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:34:48):**  You cannot, obviously on privacy reasons, it's a bit like the, I think they did it for  
**[0:34:52-0:34:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:34:52):**  energy use in households.  
**[0:34:54-0:34:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:34:54):**  I don't remember where in the US, like you've been using on average, like you got a smiley,  
**[0:34:59-0:35:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:34:59):**  you've been using less than your average household in your neighborhood, or you've been using  
**[0:35:03-0:35:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:35:03):**  a lot more.  
**[0:35:04-0:35:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:35:04):**  And they actually saw that people adjusted to that peer pressure of the peers they didn't  
**[0:35:08-0:35:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:35:08):**  know, or they couldn't identify.  
**[0:35:09-0:35:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:35:09):**  But it's, that's very interesting.  
**[0:35:11-0:35:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:35:11):**  Yeah.  
**[0:35:11-0:35:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:35:11):**  Basically it's not adding much to understand who are the people behind the best farmers  
**[0:35:18-0:35:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:35:18):**  of a bike.  
**[0:35:19-0:35:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:35:19):**  It can be interesting for your curiosity, but I think that the moment you understand  
**[0:35:24-0:35:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:35:24):**  that you are better or worst than the best.  
**[0:35:28-0:35:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:35:28):**  And if you, if you through the analysis of the information, you can understand why you  
**[0:35:36-0:35:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:35:36):**  are better or worst.  
**[0:35:39-0:35:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:35:39):**  That's for us already interesting and powerful enough to make people thinking and to make  
**[0:35:47-0:35:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:35:47):**  agronomists and farm manager changing the way they are operating.  
**[0:35:54-0:35:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:35:54):**  No, it's extremely powerful.  
**[0:35:56-0:35:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:35:56):**  And what are the next steps for this?  
**[0:35:58-0:36:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:35:58):**  I mean, you said simplified, I think a number of times that you can make it more complex,  
**[0:36:02-0:36:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:36:02):**  but you're mostly, I mean, the article, I think, I think is mostly the first pilot is  
**[0:36:06-0:36:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:36:06):**  mostly on Belgium.  
**[0:36:07-0:36:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:36:07):**  And what are your plans with this, my soil capital, with this dashboard, with this service?  
**[0:36:12-0:36:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:36:12):**  Is it open to all farmers?  
**[0:36:14-0:36:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:36:14):**  Should people call if they're in Spain, if they're East of Berlin, like Gannadix, what's  
**[0:36:18-0:36:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:36:18):**  the current status and the plan?  
**[0:36:20-0:36:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:36:20):**  So the plan on the very short term is to continue the development of the tool in a close radius  
**[0:36:27-0:36:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:36:27):**  around us, because we have access to farmers and we can co-develop with farmers that we  
**[0:36:31-0:36:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:36:31):**  know, fine tune the tool.  
**[0:36:34-0:36:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:36:34):**  France, Belgium, on the medium term, a few months will translate the tool in English  
**[0:36:45-0:36:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:36:45):**  so that we can extend the perimeter because we have a few farmers and farmers association  
**[0:36:52-0:37:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:36:52):**  in UK, for example, we're interested to start discussing about these dashboards.  
**[0:37:03-0:37:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:37:03):**  That's on the perimeter.  
**[0:37:07-0:37:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:37:07):**  We are also discussing with a few companies related to agriculture or not, who wants to  
**[0:37:16-0:37:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:37:16):**  see carbon and carbon sequestration as something interesting.  
**[0:37:21-0:37:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:37:21):**  So in parallel, we are trying to build a discussion with these people to see if at some point  
**[0:37:29-0:37:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:37:29):**  in the future, they could come with extra financing for farmers to reward the farmers  
**[0:37:37-0:37:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:37:37):**  who did a good job or wants to go faster.  
**[0:37:41-0:37:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:37:41):**  And what we also are aiming to do in the short term is to come with additional indicators  
**[0:37:54-0:38:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:37:54):**  to complete the carbon picture with indicators like just to make, to be for the agronomist  
**[0:38:06-0:38:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:38:06):**  or the farmer who analyze his information to understand where he should, why he's better,  
**[0:38:15-0:38:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:38:15):**  why he's not as good as the best producers.  
**[0:38:23-0:38:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:38:23):**  So the rotation, diversity, the usage of certain agrochemicals, the land coverage, the soil  
**[0:38:36-0:38:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:38:36):**  disturbance, we have already the fuel consumption and the number of hours spent in the tractors.  
**[0:38:44-0:38:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:38:44):**  So we are working on those information also to make the discussion between the agronomist  
**[0:38:53-0:39:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:38:53):**  and the farmer or us and the farmer richer and more clear in terms of what should you  
**[0:39:02-0:39:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:39:02):**  change in your operation if you want to reach the best performer.  
**[0:39:06-0:39:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:39:06):**  Just having a question, wanting to hear your view on this, maybe also on a long term, because  
**[0:39:12-0:39:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:39:12):**  the whole discussion on carbon sequestration and earning basically additional income for  
**[0:39:17-0:39:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:39:17):**  farmers if they do store more carbon in the soil, it has such an incredible hype, obviously  
**[0:39:23-0:39:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:39:23):**  Terratron and Indigo, they are pushing it on that sort of international level.  
**[0:39:28-0:39:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:39:28):**  But I mean, there's like, I wouldn't know about 10 to 15 different groups that are trying  
**[0:39:33-0:39:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:39:33):**  to build a business around this idea.  
**[0:39:35-0:39:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:39:35):**  And I've spoken to quite a few of those.  
**[0:39:37-0:39:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:39:37):**  And often it's young people who are incredibly well gifted, and they come from an interdisciplinary  
**[0:39:42-0:39:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:39:42):**  approach.  
**[0:39:42-0:39:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:39:42):**  And I mean, what I always tell them or what I try to show them is that just focusing on  
**[0:39:47-0:39:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:39:47):**  carbon, we tend, I believe, I mean, I don't know, but I believe we tend to do the same  
**[0:39:52-0:39:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:39:52):**  kind of mistake that we usually try to do it because we are talking about a complex  
**[0:39:57-0:39:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:39:57):**  ecosystem.  
**[0:39:57-0:39:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:39:57):**  Right.  
**[0:39:58-0:40:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:39:58):**  And carbon is one of many.  
**[0:40:01-0:40:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:40:01):**  And if we think about monetizing something else, what I think we should do, what farmers  
**[0:40:06-0:40:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:40:06):**  are bringing to the ecosystem, but also to us as people in general, don't we have to  
**[0:40:12-0:40:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:40:12):**  look at it much, much broadly and think about all those different ecosystem functions where  
**[0:40:18-0:40:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:40:18):**  aesthetics, for example, is a part of as well as a social component.  
**[0:40:22-0:40:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:40:22):**  And obviously, the whole carbon thing is much easier to, what do you call it, like to capture,  
**[0:40:33-0:40:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:40:33):**  I guess, and then monetize it.  
**[0:40:35-0:40:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:40:35):**  But don't we have to look at a much bigger picture and don't we have to do today in order  
**[0:40:41-0:40:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:40:41):**  to develop the solution sooner than later?  
**[0:40:44-0:40:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:40:44):**  Most of you on that.  
**[0:40:45-0:40:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:40:45):**  Yeah, I'm probably not the best person to answer that in the team because we have one  
**[0:40:51-0:40:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:40:51):**  person who is working on that more than me.  
**[0:40:54-0:41:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:40:54):**  But what I can see fully agree with you, carbon is a very restrictive way of measuring the  
**[0:41:02-0:41:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:41:02):**  performance of a farm.  
**[0:41:05-0:41:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:41:05):**  And any farmer could, any tricky farmer could think very quickly how to store carbon without  
**[0:41:13-0:41:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:41:13):**  being regenerative at all and how to do it fast.  
**[0:41:17-0:41:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:41:17):**  So I agree with you that this is something that is not enough to measure or to classify  
**[0:41:25-0:41:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:41:25):**  farms.  
**[0:41:26-0:41:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:41:26):**  But I think that, remember that the price of the carbon today is very low.  
**[0:41:31-0:41:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:41:31):**  So it will not be with the price of carbon of CO2 of 15, 20, 25, even 30 euro per ton  
**[0:41:39-0:41:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:41:39):**  sequestered.  
**[0:41:41-0:41:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:41:41):**  And when you understand that a regenerative farm probably will sequester between two and  
**[0:41:50-0:41:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:41:50):**  three, four tons per hectare per year, it makes less than or around 100 euro per hectare  
**[0:41:58-0:42:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:41:58):**  of difference, which is for me totally, absolutely not enough to make people change.  
**[0:42:07-0:42:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:42:07):**  It can help, but it's not enough.  
**[0:42:10-0:42:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:42:10):**  So I believe that together with this carbon thing, we will in the future discuss with  
**[0:42:23-0:42:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:42:23):**  sophisticated companies, impact investors or people in the farming ecosystems where  
**[0:42:30-0:42:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:42:30):**  that will understand that the carbon is a good metric.  
**[0:42:33-0:42:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:42:33):**  But together with the carbon, there are many other benefits that could be attached, like  
**[0:42:38-0:42:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:42:38):**  the biodiversity, like the soil erosion, like the water quality, a little bit like a  
**[0:42:45-0:42:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:42:45):**  Jaron Clump.  
**[0:42:46-0:42:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:42:46):**  And they're trying to measure these natural benefits and quantify and make it more also  
**[0:42:54-0:42:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:42:54):**  valuable.  
**[0:42:55-0:43:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:42:55):**  So I believe that in our developed country, we will have opportunity and farmers will  
**[0:43:02-0:43:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:43:02):**  have opportunity to be paid more for additional services.  
**[0:43:07-0:43:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:43:07):**  And I'm not obsessed by receiving more from external companies, as I was saying at the  
**[0:43:18-0:43:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:43:18):**  beginning, but I think that it will make things more clear for people outside of farming that  
**[0:43:28-0:43:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:43:28):**  carbon is not everything.  
**[0:43:32-0:43:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:43:32):**  And I think that this will help this carbon discussion to be a little bit more richer,  
**[0:43:39-0:43:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:43:39):**  the certification to be also a little bit more sophisticated in the future and more  
**[0:43:44-0:43:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:43:44):**  rewarding for farmers who want to change, who are making efforts for those who need  
**[0:43:50-0:43:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:43:50):**  that extra money.  
**[0:43:51-0:44:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:43:51):**  But I understand, but I still think that the carbon sequestration measure is probably not  
**[0:44:03-0:44:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:44:03):**  the less worst entry point.  
**[0:44:05-0:44:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:44:05):**  Yeah, and just we're going to interview Jaron Clump, founder of Sohero soon on the podcast.  
**[0:44:12-0:44:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:44:12):**  So you should be, if you're listening to this, I don't know when there could be an interview  
**[0:44:16-0:44:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:44:16):**  already online so you can check it out.  
**[0:44:18-0:44:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:44:18):**  Thanks for sharing your thoughts.  
**[0:44:19-0:44:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:44:19):**  And I think, yeah, I mean, I agree.  
**[0:44:22-0:44:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:44:22):**  Although I do think that when you refer to third party capital, let's say, I think there  
**[0:44:28-0:44:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:44:28):**  is quite a lot to come and not necessarily in a transition finance way, but like just  
**[0:44:34-0:44:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:44:34):**  realizing what we are in our little bubble here in and around Berlin and the companies  
**[0:44:41-0:44:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:44:41):**  that we are in contact with and even people who we are in contact with, there's such an  
**[0:44:46-0:44:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:44:46):**  incredible value and there's such an incredible also sense of value and understanding of the  
**[0:44:55-0:44:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:44:55):**  kind of things that we try to do here on the farm and why we're trying to do it.  
**[0:44:58-0:45:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:44:58):**  So companies, large companies.  
**[0:45:01-0:45:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:45:01):**  We just got a message.  
**[0:45:02-0:45:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:45:02):**  You remember, even from a person yesterday through the website, I want to do a shout  
**[0:45:07-0:45:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:45:07):**  out to Jens.  
**[0:45:08-0:45:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:45:08):**  Thank you very much for that message.  
**[0:45:09-0:45:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:45:09):**  I sent it to Benedict.  
**[0:45:10-0:45:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:45:10):**  Somebody reached out that wants to donate some money to plant a number of hedgerows  
**[0:45:15-0:45:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:45:15):**  because he's a beekeeper, sees the biodiversity going down and wants to donate some money  
**[0:45:21-0:45:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:45:21):**  to Benedict.  
**[0:45:21-0:45:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:45:21):**  And we're going to figure out how to increase biodiversity.  
**[0:45:24-0:45:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:45:24):**  Very small example, but it does show there is something happening on that front, both  
**[0:45:29-0:45:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:45:29):**  small and big.  
**[0:45:30-0:45:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:45:30):**  Yeah.  
**[0:45:31-0:45:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:45:31):**  And I think, you know, letting people take part in the experiences that we have being  
**[0:45:35-0:45:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:45:35):**  outside, planting the trees themselves, that brings an immediate connection to the space.  
**[0:45:41-0:45:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:45:41):**  It even has some spiritual element of well-being for those kind of people.  
**[0:45:45-0:45:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:45:45):**  And it's even for companies.  
**[0:45:47-0:45:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:45:47):**  So I think there is actually great potential for farmers to also think in that direction.  
**[0:45:53-0:46:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:45:53):**  So yeah, I just wanted to give a statement there in this way because I think we can be  
**[0:46:01-0:46:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:46:01):**  really positive about farming and we can be really positive about the way that we're  
**[0:46:05-0:46:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:46:05):**  trying to develop into because we're doing good stuff.  
**[0:46:09-0:46:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:46:09):**  I mean, biodiversity is growing, the countryside is thriving, the nature is thriving.  
**[0:46:17-0:46:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:46:17):**  It just makes sense.  
**[0:46:18-0:46:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:46:18):**  And people realize that and people value that.  
**[0:46:20-0:46:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:46:20):**  So I am actually really positive about that.  
**[0:46:23-0:46:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:46:23):**  Yeah.  
**[0:46:23-0:46:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:46:23):**  And maybe I've been too extreme, but the time is limited.  
**[0:46:29-0:46:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:46:29):**  So it's difficult to discuss about all the exceptions or small case.  
**[0:46:36-0:46:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:46:36):**  And at Soil Capital, we're working with large scale farmers most of the time.  
**[0:46:42-0:46:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:46:42):**  So the connection with the people, the connection with the consumers are completely lost.  
**[0:46:49-0:46:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:46:49):**  So people who are heavily subsidized, seeing the money coming back from the community  
**[0:46:55-0:46:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:46:55):**  through subsidies and so on.  
**[0:46:58-0:47:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:46:58):**  So clearly there are different kinds of agriculture.  
**[0:47:02-0:47:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:47:02):**  And just to give the example of our small operations in Belgium, my partner and I are  
**[0:47:10-0:47:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:47:10):**  farming on a small area.  
**[0:47:13-0:47:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:47:13):**  He has a butchery and there is a strong connection with the local community.  
**[0:47:19-0:47:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:47:19):**  And I clearly value also the fact that at a very local scale, like the one we have in  
**[0:47:29-0:47:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:47:29):**  Belgium, you can create a very interesting impact.  
**[0:47:35-0:47:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:47:35):**  And the people, the consumers can really help the farmer to develop or to transition.  
**[0:47:46-0:47:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:47:46):**  And they are much more rewarding and less, I would say, skeptical and difficult than  
**[0:47:56-0:48:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:47:56):**  what you could think while reading the newspaper or Facebook and so on.  
**[0:48:00-0:48:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:48:00):**  They will understand that sometime in a conventional farm, you're going to use some glycoside,  
**[0:48:05-0:48:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:48:05):**  for example, or they will understand that you cannot be working 100% on feed coming  
**[0:48:13-0:48:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:48:13):**  from the farm because you're not producing all the protein yet.  
**[0:48:18-0:48:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:48:18):**  And they will understand clearly that your vision and the direction you want to take  
**[0:48:23-0:48:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:48:23):**  and that you cannot go there in one day.  
**[0:48:26-0:48:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:48:26):**  So all of this, I think it's definitely those are meaningful example and necessary experience  
**[0:48:36-0:48:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:48:36):**  and pilot to be ahead of the curve and to influence the other.  
**[0:48:41-0:48:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:48:41):**  But for the large scale farming that we are where we are involved, mostly at Soil Capital  
**[0:48:48-0:48:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:48:48):**  or bigger farmer, I'm not talking about only people who got 1000 hectares or 2000 hectares,  
**[0:48:54-0:49:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:48:54):**  but a farm of 150 hectares or 100 hectares in Belgium or in France today, it's a big  
**[0:49:00-0:49:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:49:00):**  operation with selling 90% or 99% on the commodity market, producing weeds, export to export  
**[0:49:12-0:49:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:49:12):**  and meat to export and milk to export.  
**[0:49:15-0:49:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:49:15):**  And so this is another discussion and we haven't discussed about markets.  
**[0:49:18-0:49:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:49:18):**  And that I think is one of the purpose of the discussion.  
**[0:49:21-0:49:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:49:21):**  But clearly there is another part of our efforts at Soil Capital to work on the market and  
**[0:49:29-0:49:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:49:29):**  how to decommoditize in the future all those production and work with clients to do that.  
**[0:49:37-0:49:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:49:37):**  But that's another step, another additional revenue, another financing way to do that.  
**[0:49:44-0:49:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:49:44):**  A way to accelerate the transition that we can definitely explore in another discussion.  
**[0:49:51-0:49:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:49:51):**  But today, I think that what I wanted to highlight is really the fact that with the current market,  
**[0:49:56-0:50:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:49:56):**  with the current system, how can we improve at Farmgate without talking about the additional  
**[0:50:05-0:50:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:50:05):**  revenue that can be generated by such an initiative?  
**[0:50:08-0:50:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:50:08):**  Yeah, and I want to thank you for that.  
**[0:50:10-0:50:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:50:10):**  Being conscious of your time, we definitely will come back on the market piece and another time.  
**[0:50:15-0:50:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:50:15):**  I think we always end up at about an hour and feeling, I at least feel that we scratched  
**[0:50:21-0:50:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:50:21):**  the surface, pun definitely intended.  
**[0:50:23-0:50:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:50:23):**  And talking about scratching the surface, Benedict has to go because he has to pick  
**[0:50:26-0:50:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:50:26):**  up 600 chickens.  
**[0:50:27-0:50:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:50:27):**  We're going to scratch a lot of chickens.  
**[0:50:29-0:50:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:50:29):**  So it's a very exciting day.  
**[0:50:31-0:50:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:50:31):**  It's a very exciting day.  
**[0:50:32-0:50:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:50:32):**  Baby chickens.  
**[0:50:33-0:50:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:50:33):**  Yeah.  
**[0:50:33-0:50:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:50:33):**  So I want to thank you so much, you guys, for sharing.  
**[0:50:37-0:50:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:50:37):**  You've been on the podcast in a very short forum.  
**[0:50:39-0:50:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:50:39):**  Luckily, we had more time this time to go deeper.  
**[0:50:41-0:50:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:50:41):**  Still not enough, obviously, because there's so much knowledge and so much you've seen  
**[0:50:45-0:50:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:50:45):**  and you've done in this space.  
**[0:50:46-0:50:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:50:46):**  I thank you for coming on, sharing your knowledge, your experience, your opportunities, your  
**[0:50:51-0:50:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:50:51):**  doubts, et cetera, and we'll be in touch.  
**[0:50:54-0:50:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:50:54):**  Thank you, Koen.  
**[0:50:55-0:50:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:50:55):**  And thank you, Benedict.  
**[0:50:56-0:50:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:50:56):**  And really, congratulations for the work you're doing.  
**[0:50:58-0:51:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:50:58):**  Because as I was saying during the podcast, we see the value of that while having clients  
**[0:51:02-0:51:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:51:02):**  or farmers calling us to say, we've been in touch.  
**[0:51:05-0:51:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:51:05):**  We've been in touch or touched by messages, by information or bringing us to think about  
**[0:51:11-0:51:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:51:11):**  changing our system.  
**[0:51:12-0:51:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:51:12):**  So you're doing a great job.  
**[0:51:14-0:51:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:51:14):**  Thank you so much for that.  
**[0:51:15-0:51:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:51:15):**  Bye.

**[0:51:56-0:52:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:51:56):**  Dear friends of the podcast, I'm super excited to share with you the online video course  
**[0:52:01-0:52:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:52:01):**  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[0:52:05-0:52:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:52:05):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  
**[0:52:09-0:52:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:52:09):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[0:52:10-0:52:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:52:10):**  After a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of audio asking the question,  
**[0:52:14-0:52:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:52:14):**  how to put money to work in regenerating soils, and I've been following the space since 2011  
**[0:52:19-0:52:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:52:19):**  and recording these podcasts since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  
**[0:52:24-0:52:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:52:24):**  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  
**[0:52:26-0:52:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:52:26):**  How have we built our decision-making framework, what to focus on with the podcast?  
**[0:52:31-0:52:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:52:31):**  How have we picked interviewees and what questions should you ask?

**[0:53:47-0:53:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:53:47):**  So you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:53:49-0:53:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:53:49):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture

**[0:54:04-0:54:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:54:04):**  if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:54:06-0:54:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:54:06):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:54:11-0:54:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:54:11):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:54:15-0:54:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:54:15):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:54:19-0:54:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:54:19):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:54:20-0:54:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:54:20):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:54:22-0:54:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:54:22):**  Unfortunately, that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:54:25-0:54:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:54:25):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:54:28-0:54:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:54:28):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:54:30-0:54:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/26/transition-finance-ep6/#t=0:54:30):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.

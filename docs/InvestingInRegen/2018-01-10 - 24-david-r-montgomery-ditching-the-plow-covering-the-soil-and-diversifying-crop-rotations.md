**[0:00:25-0:00:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:00:25):**  agriculture space to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil,  
**[0:00:30-0:00:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:00:30):**  people, local communities and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:00:36):**  Why my focus on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:38-0:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:00:38):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:00:42-0:00:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:00:42):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:00:45):**  And it's time that we as investors big and small and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:00:49-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:00:49):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:00:54):**  In March last year we launched our Patreon community to make it easy for fans to support

**[0:01:20-0:01:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:01:20):**  Welcome to investing in regenerative agriculture, investing as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:01:24-0:01:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:01:24):**  In these interviews I'm talking to people who are scaling up the regenerative agriculture  
**[0:01:28-0:01:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:01:28):**  sector either by increasing the inflow of investment capital or by scaling up the enterprises  
**[0:01:34-0:01:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:01:34):**  on and in the ground and by doing so exploring what it means to be an impact investor in  
**[0:01:39-0:01:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:01:39):**  regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:01:41):**  Why my focus on regenerative agriculture?  
**[0:01:43-0:01:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:01:43):**  Because the roots of so many of the issues we're facing in the world today can be found  
**[0:01:47-0:01:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:01:47):**  in agriculture.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:01:49):**  From droughts, migrant flows, obesity, social issues, water wars, climate change, hunger,  
**[0:01:54-0:01:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:01:54):**  they all have a connection to how we treat the land, grow food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:01:59):**  I hope you will enjoy this interview as much as I did making it.

**[0:02:14-0:02:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:02:14):**  Revolution, David R Montgomery.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:02:16):**  We discussed the world's oldest problem, the loss of soil fertility and how David went  
**[0:02:21-0:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:02:21):**  from being a pessimist to being a cautious optimist and what made him believe that this  
**[0:02:26-0:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:02:26):**  time it's different.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:02:27):**  Enjoy!  
**[0:02:28-0:02:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:02:28):**  So welcome to investing in regenerative agriculture, investing as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:02:32):**  I'm Kuma Sayan, your host, and in the podcast of today I'm joined by David R Montgomery,  
**[0:02:36-0:02:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:02:36):**  a MacArthur Fellow and writer of the book Growing a Revolution, where he makes a passionate  
**[0:02:40-0:02:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:02:40):**  pledge for building soil by ditching the plough, covering soil and diversifying crop rotations.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:02:46):**  He has traveled the world visiting farmers large and small, traditional and organic,  
**[0:02:50-0:02:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:02:50):**  who are very successfully building soil and going against most of modern agriculture science.  
**[0:02:55-0:02:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:02:55):**  I'm going to ask him all about what he learned and what needs to happen to scale this.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:02:59):**  Welcome David.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:03:00):**  Oh thank you Kon, it's a pleasure to be here.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:03:02):**  So to start with a personal question, as a geologist how did you end up in regenerative  
**[0:03:06-0:03:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:03:06):**  agriculture?  
**[0:03:07-0:03:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:03:07):**  Well it's a long story but I'll give you the quick version of it.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:03:11):**  Now we have time.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:03:12):**  Yeah I'm the kind of geologist who works on landscape evolution, so I'm a geomorphologist  
**[0:03:19-0:03:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:03:19):**  and as part of that I learned to study soil erosion because erosion is how landscapes  
**[0:03:24-0:03:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:03:24):**  get shaped and when you're looking at soil erosion the other half of the equation is  
**[0:03:28-0:03:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:03:28):**  soil production.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:03:29):**  So I've trained to look at the balance between the rates that soils are produced and the  
**[0:03:34-0:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:03:34):**  rates that soils are eroded over geologic time, over long time frames.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:03:39):**  And the second popular book that I wrote was called Dirt the Erosion of Civilizations that  
**[0:03:44-0:03:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:03:44):**  looked back at the problem of soil erosion through history and that merged archaeology  
**[0:03:50-0:03:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:03:50):**  and geology and it turned out that by the time I was done writing that book I had written  
**[0:03:55-0:04:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:03:55):**  a history of farming and because the practice of plowing the soil was something that had  
**[0:04:01-0:04:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:04:01):**  led to topsoil loss that had impacted civilizations around the world time and again through history.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:04:08):**  And this ended up leading me to start thinking about soil as a system that could be influenced  
**[0:04:14-0:04:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:04:14):**  by human actions and not just over geologic time.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:04:17):**  And I got really interested in the effects of farming practices, how we have traditionally  
**[0:04:23-0:04:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:04:23):**  farmed, how we're farming today and that eventually led me to think about whether we could reverse  
**[0:04:27-0:04:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:04:27):**  the problem of soil erosion and degradation and to do that I got into looking at farmers  
**[0:04:33-0:04:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:04:33):**  who'd restored their soil on farms around the world and that led me right into the world  
**[0:04:37-0:04:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:04:37):**  of regenerative agriculture because that's really what regenerative agriculture is all  
**[0:04:41-0:04:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:04:41):**  about is rebuilding the fertility of the soil as a consequence of farming and reversing  
**[0:04:48-0:04:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:04:48):**  this long history that I wrote about in the dirt book.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:04:50):**  So the dirt book and the growing revolution book are kind of bookends of looking at the  
**[0:04:54-0:04:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:04:54):**  nature of the problem and realizing how to actually solve it.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:04:59):**  You call it in the book and it's even a chapter, mankind's oldest problem, I don't know if  
**[0:05:04-0:05:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:05:04):**  I got the chapter title exactly right, but it's the one thing we've been battling with  
**[0:05:08-0:05:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:05:08):**  every century and many civilizations have gone under because of that.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:05:13):**  What makes it different this time?  
**[0:05:15-0:05:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:05:15):**  Why would we be, I wouldn't say arrogant, but be optimistic enough to think, okay, this  
**[0:05:20-0:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:05:20):**  time we got it right and we can actually build a system that is more anti-fragile and more  
**[0:05:28-0:05:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:05:28):**  sustainable in the long term?  
**[0:05:29-0:05:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:05:29):**  Well that question kind of encapsulates the story of my transformation from something  
**[0:05:34-0:05:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:05:34):**  of a pessimist about this problem when I was writing dirt and looking at the history of  
**[0:05:39-0:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:05:39):**  land abuse over the century.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:05:40):**  You call it dirt, so yeah.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:05:42):**  Yeah, and that's what if we basically take soil, you know, healthy fertile life filled  
**[0:05:48-0:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:05:48):**  soil and we lose the organic matter and we lose the native fertility, we're turning it  
**[0:05:54-0:05:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:05:54):**  into dirt, something that just has the geology and not the biology and it's the combination  
**[0:05:58-0:06:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:05:58):**  that makes for healthy fertile soil.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:06:02):**  But the, you know, what really sort of turned me around in going from being a pessimist  
**[0:06:06-0:06:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:06:06):**  on the issue to being an optimist on the issue was seeing examples of modern farmers who  
**[0:06:10-0:06:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:06:10):**  had actually pulled it off, who had actually adapted their practices in ways that rebuilt  
**[0:06:16-0:06:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:06:16):**  the organic matter, rebuilt the fertility of their land and they did it through intensive  
**[0:06:22-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:06:22):**  farming.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:06:23):**  And this was a very optimistic thing because if we can change that pattern of soil degradation  
**[0:06:29-0:06:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:06:29):**  as a consequence of farming into one of soil building as a consequence of farming, we could  
**[0:06:34-0:06:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:06:34):**  solve that really old problem.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:06:36):**  And what really makes it possible now is I think a few things.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:06:40):**  There's on the one hand, we've learned a lot and we've got examples of farmers who have  
**[0:06:45-0:06:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:06:45):**  done it that we can learn from as I did.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:06:48):**  And there's, if we combine the ancient wisdom of things like crop rotations and planting  
**[0:06:54-0:07:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:06:54):**  legumes and diversifying our rotations so we're not just growing one or two things time  
**[0:07:01-0:07:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:07:01):**  and time again in the same field, those things are really ancient wisdom that have been used  
**[0:07:06-0:07:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:07:06):**  by traditional societies around the world but that also use the plow.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:07:10):**  And it's the disturbance of the land through tillage, through plowing that has led to the  
**[0:07:14-0:07:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:07:14):**  long term slow degradation of soil fertility by disrupting mycorrhizal fungi that help  
**[0:07:20-0:07:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:07:20):**  feed the plants and by burning down soil organic matter over time.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:07:27):**  We now have modern technologies that we can use to couple those ancient ideas of crop  
**[0:07:32-0:07:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:07:32):**  rotations and keeping the ground covered with cover crops and more diverse rotations.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:07:38):**  We can couple that with less disturbance, either no till or minimal tillage applications.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:07:44):**  And you put those three things together under the label of conservation agriculture and  
**[0:07:48-0:07:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:07:48):**  you've got a new sort of style and philosophy of farming that really seems to work to build  
**[0:07:54-0:08:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:07:54):**  soil fertility because it's those three things done together, minimizing the disturbance  
**[0:08:00-0:08:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:08:00):**  in effect feeding the soil organic matter through cover cropping and diversifying rotations  
**[0:08:05-0:08:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:08:05):**  which helps with micronutrient provisioning and pest suppression.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:08:10):**  That allows us to build up soil organic matter which can restart a lot of the biological  
**[0:08:15-0:08:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:08:15):**  processes that are essential to native soil fertility, sort of nature's way of farming.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:08:22):**  And the other half of that, so we have this knowledge of how to put these pieces together  
**[0:08:25-0:08:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:08:25):**  into a new system of farming that really seems to work.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:08:29):**  And on the other hand, there's the economic pressures that are affecting modern farming  
**[0:08:35-0:08:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:08:35):**  where if you go talk to most farmers, they're not really anxious to pay a lot more for fertilizers  
**[0:08:40-0:08:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:08:40):**  and pesticides or diesel.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:08:43):**  Those are really high ticket items in terms of modern farming.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:08:47):**  We rely on them a lot and they actually have become progressively more expensive in terms  
**[0:08:52-0:08:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:08:52):**  of on-farm economics.  
**[0:08:54-0:08:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:08:54):**  While at the same time, the large harvest that we've been producing in the 20th and  
**[0:08:59-0:09:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:08:59):**  21st centuries have depressed the prices for the commodity crops that a lot of farmers  
**[0:09:03-0:09:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:09:03):**  in the developed world grow.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:09:05):**  They're in a squeeze basically.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:09:06):**  Exactly.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:09:07):**  They're in a squeeze where they've gotten so good at growing so much stuff that the  
**[0:09:12-0:09:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:09:12):**  price they get for their product is depressed, especially relative to their value since it's  
**[0:09:16-0:09:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:09:16):**  the one thing everybody needs other than water and air.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:09:20):**  And at the same time, the cost of the inputs that they've been trained to rely on to produce  
**[0:09:26-0:09:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:09:26):**  those harvests have gone through the roof.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:09:28):**  So they're caught in a squeeze in the middle.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:09:29):**  And you see that play out in my country, the United States for example, with the great  
**[0:09:34-0:09:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:09:34):**  decline of the family farms and the growing size of farms.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:09:38):**  The old adage of get big or get out that was thrown around in the 1970s was a direct consequence  
**[0:09:44-0:09:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:09:44):**  of that.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:09:45):**  And so what gives me hope is that we've learned this sort of new way of farming that can build  
**[0:09:50-0:09:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:09:50):**  soil fertility and as a consequence of that, it allows the farmers that I visited to spend  
**[0:09:57-0:10:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:09:57):**  less on diesel because they're not using their tractors as much.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:10:00):**  They're not tilling as much.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:10:02):**  They spend less on fertilizer because they've rebuilt their native fertility of their land  
**[0:10:06-0:10:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:10:06):**  enough that they can cut their fertilizer use by a half to 90% or more.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:10:11):**  And they aren't using anywhere near as much in the way of pesticides.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:10:15):**  And so that's greatly reducing their input costs.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:10:18):**  And what happened to their yields?  
**[0:10:20-0:10:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:10:20):**  They either were maintained or they went up over time.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:10:24):**  So they're spending less to grow more.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:10:26):**  It's a good recipe for short term farm economics.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:10:30):**  And so we're at this juncture now where for one of the first times as far as I can tell  
**[0:10:36-0:10:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:10:36):**  in history, the short term economics for farmers really are lining up with the long term interest  
**[0:10:42-0:10:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:10:42):**  of society in protecting and rebuilding the fertility of our land.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:10:47):**  There's a lot of what I talked about in the dirt book looked at how the short term incentives  
**[0:10:53-0:10:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:10:53):**  to maximize this year's return and this year's harvest led to the overuse of fertilizers,  
**[0:10:59-0:11:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:10:59):**  the overworking of land and the progressive degradation of it over generations of farming.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:11:06):**  These two trends in terms of knowing – figuring out how to do conservation agriculture and  
**[0:11:10-0:11:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:11:10):**  the sort of modern economic trends are really pointing in the direction of real optimism  
**[0:11:16-0:11:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:11:16):**  that we may be able to solve these problems because if farmers can do better by adopting  
**[0:11:22-0:11:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:11:22):**  them and they improve the fertility of their land in ways that reduces pollution, that  
**[0:11:28-0:11:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:11:28):**  means our ability to feed everybody but has side benefits of storing carbon in the ground  
**[0:11:33-0:11:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:11:33):**  and protecting on-farm biodiversity which is important given just the sheer acreage  
**[0:11:38-0:11:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:11:38):**  globally that is in agricultural land.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:11:42):**  This is a real moment where these kinds of practices could catch on because it's not  
**[0:11:47-0:11:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:11:47):**  a question of ecology versus the environment.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:11:50):**  It's a real win-win scenario.  
**[0:11:53-0:11:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:11:53):**  Extremely interesting that overview of the pressures and why the time is now but still  
**[0:11:57-0:12:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:11:57):**  I'm suspicious when somebody says, yeah, but this time it's different, especially  
**[0:12:01-0:12:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:12:01):**  if we have a few millennia of very different experiences with soil and civilization.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:12:07):**  But you have examples in the book where very simple measurement of soil carbon in soil  
**[0:12:14-0:12:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:12:14):**  is higher on some of the farms you visited compared to a native forest.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:12:19):**  So there is something to it.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:12:20):**  What would you say to the skeptics and say, yeah, but everybody always says that this  
**[0:12:23-0:12:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:12:23):**  time it's different?  
**[0:12:24-0:12:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:12:24):**  Well, I would say that as a scientist, it's good to be a skeptic.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:12:28):**  That's exactly the right question one should be asking.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:12:31):**  Why is it different this time?  
**[0:12:32-0:12:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:12:32):**  I think there are two angles to answering that.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:12:35):**  The first one, the most basic one is that we have to get it right this time.  
**[0:12:39-0:12:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:12:39):**  We don't have any new places to go to once we degrade farmland globally.  
**[0:12:44-0:12:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:12:44):**  We have to, as a global society, we've got to learn how to farm in ways that will maintain  
**[0:12:50-0:12:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:12:50):**  the fertility of our land if we're going to be able to maintain the agricultural foundation  
**[0:12:55-0:12:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:12:55):**  of civilization.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:12:56):**  So at one level, there's sort of a real imperative this time.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:13:00):**  And at the other level, the reason I can argue that it's different this time is I've visited  
**[0:13:05-0:13:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:13:05):**  farms around the world who've already done it.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:13:07):**  It's not abstract.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:13:08):**  It's not a theory.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:13:09):**  That's one of the reasons I took six months off from my teaching job at the University  
**[0:13:13-0:13:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:13:13):**  of Washington to basically travel around the world and visit these farmers is I wanted  
**[0:13:18-0:13:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:13:18):**  to see for myself and not just sort of read about it or listen to people about it but  
**[0:13:23-0:13:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:13:23):**  go to these farms, dig holes in the ground, look at their soil, learn the history of the  
**[0:13:28-0:13:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:13:28):**  farm, understand what they did to rebuild their soil and then stand back and understand  
**[0:13:33-0:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:13:33):**  the farm economics that they went through and then stand back and try and draw the generalizations  
**[0:13:39-0:13:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:13:39):**  and patterns that one can from a suite of experiences.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:13:43):**  And it's really the sort of confluence of a new way of thinking about the soil that  
**[0:13:49-0:13:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:13:49):**  really is truly new in terms of combining these three practices of minimal disturbance,  
**[0:13:54-0:13:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:13:54):**  cover crops and crop rotations.  
**[0:13:56-0:14:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:13:56):**  You can look back through history and there's very few examples where people put together  
**[0:14:00-0:14:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:14:00):**  that system in practice on the land at a large scale.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:14:04):**  So there's sort of a new way of thinking which is sort of the seeds of any sort of revolution  
**[0:14:09-0:14:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:14:09):**  in practice is they're preceded by a revolution in thought.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:14:12):**  And I see that we've gone through that in science.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:14:14):**  We've learned enough now about the role of microbial organisms and soil biology in soil  
**[0:14:21-0:14:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:14:21):**  fertility to start applying those ideas from a scientific perspective into the applied  
**[0:14:27-0:14:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:14:27):**  realm of agriculture.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:14:29):**  And it's changing the way we think about the land, we think about the soil and how we treat  
**[0:14:33-0:14:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:14:33):**  it.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:14:34):**  The fact that we know so much more about the soil and we're discovering more every day  
**[0:14:38-0:14:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:14:38):**  after feeling I see reports coming out of just the amount of things in there in a teaspoon  
**[0:14:43-0:14:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:14:43):**  or depends on which one you read that we didn't know maybe a year to a year or five years  
**[0:14:48-0:14:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:14:48):**  ago.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:14:49):**  It's amazing the whole world of sort of microbial science not only in the soil but also in like  
**[0:14:53-0:14:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:14:53):**  the human microbiome that's all over the news where we're learning new things about the  
**[0:14:58-0:15:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:14:58):**  organisms that live within us and the ways that they can actually benefit and bolster  
**[0:15:04-0:15:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:15:04):**  our health and promote our well-being is you know 30, 40 years ago that was kind of crazy  
**[0:15:11-0:15:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:15:11):**  talk and now it's all over the journals as people are understanding the mechanisms through  
**[0:15:16-0:15:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:15:16):**  which it works.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:15:17):**  So we've got this new scientific perspective that we can bring to bear on the problem and  
**[0:15:20-0:15:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:15:20):**  we're also at a moment where the kinds of practices farmers are taught and trained to  
**[0:15:27-0:15:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:15:27):**  use are very much reliant on very expensive inputs that are not going to be getting any  
**[0:15:33-0:15:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:15:33):**  cheaper in the near future and that come with very real and increasing environmental and  
**[0:15:40-0:15:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:15:40):**  social costs in terms of the global carbon budget but also in terms of things like groundwater  
**[0:15:45-0:15:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:15:45):**  pollution in the American Midwest for example, nitrate pollution in the Gulf of Mexico.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:15:51):**  There's all kinds of forces that are sort of converging on the idea that if we could  
**[0:15:55-0:16:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:15:55):**  have a style of farming that wasn't necessarily organic but that used less in the way of agrochemicals  
**[0:16:02-0:16:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:16:02):**  and fertilizers, diesel and pesticides.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:16:06):**  And just to be clear this is fundamentally less, it's not 5 or 10 percent you're talking  
**[0:16:09-0:16:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:16:09):**  of examples of 80, 90 and most of them going in some phase completely off.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:16:15):**  Yeah you know at least off by half and in some cases up to 80, 90 and you can do these  
**[0:16:20-0:16:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:16:20):**  practices organically so you could go completely off of them and if you could do that and still  
**[0:16:25-0:16:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:16:25):**  maintain our ability to feed everybody, our ability to maintain our harvest then that  
**[0:16:31-0:16:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:16:31):**  is a recipe, it's a set up for a whole new way of thinking about it and if it's more  
**[0:16:35-0:16:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:16:35):**  profitable for farmers to do this once they get through the transition which I found to  
**[0:16:40-0:16:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:16:40):**  be remarkably short.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:16:44):**  It's a set up for increasing adoption as people learn about it.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:16:48):**  You know obviously it takes time for new ideas to filter out of the initial adopters who  
**[0:16:55-0:17:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:16:55):**  experiment with it and tinker and figure out how to make these practices work and the people  
**[0:17:00-0:17:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:17:00):**  I visited around the world in equatorial Africa and Costa Rica and across North America they  
**[0:17:07-0:17:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:17:07):**  had in their words made the mistakes to try and figure out how it is to tailor these general  
**[0:17:13-0:17:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:17:13):**  principles of minimal disturbance, cover cropping and diversified rotations, how to tailor that  
**[0:17:19-0:17:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:17:19):**  to their land, their economy, their climate, their soils and once we've learned how to  
**[0:17:25-0:17:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:17:25):**  regionalize those general principles then it's faster to get new farmers on board in  
**[0:17:30-0:17:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:17:30):**  terms of how to adopt them because as these guys were saying they've already made the  
**[0:17:34-0:17:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:17:34):**  mistakes.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:17:36):**  So what's holding them back?  
**[0:17:38-0:17:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:17:38):**  What's holding their neighbors in Ghana and the farms you visited but also in the US and  
**[0:17:44-0:17:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:17:44):**  also in Costa Rica, what's holding them back so far?  
**[0:17:46-0:17:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:17:46):**  You know there's a couple things and I think that the biggest thing is that change is difficult.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:17:51):**  We tend to want to continue doing things the way we've been doing them simply for the reason  
**[0:17:57-0:18:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:17:57):**  that that's the way we do things and so it can take a while for any kind of new idea  
**[0:18:02-0:18:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:18:02):**  to get out of the realm of the initial adopters and spread through people who might benefit  
**[0:18:08-0:18:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:18:08):**  from it, who might actually be interested in adopting it if they knew about it or if  
**[0:18:11-0:18:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:18:11):**  they knew how to do it.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:18:13):**  So there's the inherent resistance to new ideas.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:18:17):**  There is the problem that a lot of people don't know about this and a lot of farmers  
**[0:18:21-0:18:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:18:21):**  don't know about it and it goes these three principles of minimal disturbance, cover cropping  
**[0:18:25-0:18:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:18:25):**  and diversified rotations really run 180 degrees counter to the conventional wisdom in most  
**[0:18:33-0:18:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:18:33):**  modern in terms of the way that we've farmed for the last hundred years sort of the modern  
**[0:18:38-0:18:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:18:38):**  conventional farming in the Western world where we use intensive tillage, a lot of fertilizer  
**[0:18:43-0:18:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:18:43):**  and pesticides and we tend to grow one or two crops, functional monocultures.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:18:48):**  And also in organic, I mean tillage is part of the organic movement, has been part for  
**[0:18:52-0:18:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:18:52):**  a long time.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:18:53):**  So even there we see a lot of destruction.  
**[0:18:55-0:19:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:18:55):**  I did an interview with Sally Cohen, an impact investor who rented out part of her land to  
**[0:19:00-0:19:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:19:00):**  an organic farmer and at some point she just took it back under her management because  
**[0:19:04-0:19:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:19:04):**  she saw that organic farmer keep plowing and plowing and plowing and plowing.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:19:08):**  Yeah.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:19:09):**  And you know, that was one of the things I learned in writing the dirt book was that,  
**[0:19:14-0:19:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:19:14):**  you know, when we look at the farming practices that, you know, helped take down classical  
**[0:19:19-0:19:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:19:19):**  Greece or undermine the Roman Empire, it was not modern agrochemical farming.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:19:24):**  It was organic agriculture and the key culprit there was excessive tillage, too much use  
**[0:19:29-0:19:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:19:29):**  and reliance on the plow.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:19:32):**  And there's a lot of organic farms that especially any that are on any kind of sloping land and  
**[0:19:36-0:19:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:19:36):**  aren't on a river flood plain, you know, where tillage is causing lots of damage to the soil.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:19:44):**  So it's really not a question of sort of conventional versus organic.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:19:48):**  It's a question of recalibrating the way we think about the soil and think about the land  
**[0:19:53-0:19:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:19:53):**  to try and adopt practices that build the microbial life that if it's working for us  
**[0:19:59-0:20:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:19:59):**  in the soil, is a real advantage.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:20:01):**  It's more efficient really when you have these trillions of organisms per teaspoon of soil  
**[0:20:06-0:20:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:20:06):**  doing things in there that will promote the growth and health of your crops.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:20:11):**  That's a lot better than basically spending a lot of time and fossil fuel to work against  
**[0:20:20-0:20:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:20:20):**  them and undermine their ability to work for us.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:20:22):**  And that's sort of the essence of what we were doing with modern conventional farming.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:20:28):**  So the real trick I think is to figure out how to adapt farming methods to cultivate  
**[0:20:35-0:20:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:20:35):**  that beneficial life in the soil.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:20:37):**  And there's some general principles for how to go about doing that and that's essentially  
**[0:20:43-0:20:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:20:43):**  what I learned by going and interviewing these farmers who had already done it.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:20:46):**  Because I didn't want to engage in abstract speculation about it.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:20:50):**  I wanted to go to farms where you could go, okay, it used to be a half a percent organic  
**[0:20:53-0:20:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:20:53):**  matter or two percent organic matter.  
**[0:20:56-0:21:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:20:56):**  And these farmers had rebuilt their soil organic matter or their soil carbon content back up  
**[0:21:01-0:21:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:21:01):**  to on the order of five, six, eight, ten percent.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:21:05):**  Which is not coincidentally the same transition that I saw my wife do to our yard in North  
**[0:21:12-0:21:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:21:12):**  Seattle where we live over the course of transforming our side yard which had been a lawn into a  
**[0:21:20-0:21:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:21:20):**  lush garden.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:21:21):**  And the practices that she used there are very parallel in principle to the practices  
**[0:21:26-0:21:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:21:26):**  that these farmers used to restore life to their land around the world.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:21:30):**  And what really comes out of the book as a key, you have to do all three.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:21:34):**  If you do two of the three and you're still plowing a lot, it simply doesn't work.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:21:39):**  I mean, these three are working together, otherwise you're not restoring the soil.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:21:44):**  And that's probably, that's maybe what we forgot in many of the examples, many of the  
**[0:21:48-0:21:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:21:48):**  studies that have been on the organic side, etc. in the past decades.  
**[0:21:53-0:21:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:21:53):**  If you only look at two of the three or one of the three, it simply isn't a complete system  
**[0:21:59-0:22:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:21:59):**  and simply doesn't work enough and you get these negative results.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:22:02):**  Yeah, it doesn't reliably work if you only use one or two legs of this three-legged stool  
**[0:22:08-0:22:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:22:08):**  of the system of conservation agriculture.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:22:11):**  And there's a fourth leg that one could add which is livestock and reintegrating livestock,  
**[0:22:16-0:22:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:22:16):**  animal husbandry into cropping systems.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:22:18):**  And I go into that a little bit in the book but it wasn't the main emphasis of the book.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:22:24):**  And I think that that, you've just put your finger right on one of the big problems in  
**[0:22:28-0:22:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:22:28):**  terms of thinking about adoption is that in reviewing the literature, because what, you  
**[0:22:33-0:22:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:22:33):**  know, in addition to visiting farmers, I dug into the scientific literature because that's  
**[0:22:37-0:22:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:22:37):**  what I do for a living and tried to sort of calibrate, if you will, what I was seeing  
**[0:22:44-0:22:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:22:44):**  and hearing in the field on their farms with what other people's experiences and what studies  
**[0:22:48-0:22:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:22:48):**  had found on different farms and in labs and academic settings around the world.  
**[0:22:53-0:22:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:22:53):**  And there's a real shortage of studies that have looked at the combination of all three  
**[0:22:57-0:22:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:22:57):**  practices.  
**[0:22:59-0:23:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:22:59):**  There's a lot of studies that will look just at say adopting no-till farming where you  
**[0:23:03-0:23:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:23:03):**  don't use the plow and instead...  
**[0:23:05-0:23:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:23:05):**  And a lot of herbicides.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:23:06):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:23:07-0:23:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:23:07):**  Like you might use like massive amounts of herbicides although there's some other techniques  
**[0:23:12-0:23:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:23:12):**  with cover crops that can get around that.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:23:14):**  But if you just look at no-till, you see really mixed results in terms of soil building.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:23:19):**  And it depends a lot on sort of what you're doing in addition to the no-till.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:23:23):**  Or if you just look at cover crops, again, there's sort of mixed results on average better  
**[0:23:27-0:23:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:23:27):**  than not using them.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:23:29):**  And with diversified rotations, again, you can see a boost from using them.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:23:32):**  But if you're doing full tillage in a mixed rotation, you don't get anywhere near the  
**[0:23:36-0:23:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:23:36):**  benefit that you get if you adopt all three of these practices together in a new system  
**[0:23:41-0:23:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:23:41):**  of farming.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:23:42):**  And there's one thing that scientists have really tend to be very good at.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:23:47):**  It's isolating elements of a system so you can study those and sort of figure out, well,  
**[0:23:50-0:23:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:23:50):**  what's this piece doing?  
**[0:23:53-0:23:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:23:53):**  It's much harder to actually study the effectiveness of a whole system because you've got a lot  
**[0:23:58-0:23:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:23:58):**  more variables going on.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:23:59):**  It's a lot more complicated system to try and look at.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:24:03):**  And it doesn't lend itself to sort of like clean academic tests of, well, what about  
**[0:24:08-0:24:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:24:08):**  this one little piece?  
**[0:24:09-0:24:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:24:09):**  But of course, that can cause a problem if it's the interaction among the pieces that's  
**[0:24:14-0:24:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:24:14):**  actually producing the effect.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:24:16):**  You know, consider for example like an old-fashioned watch, you know, sort of like an old wristwatch.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:24:22):**  You can take all the pieces, you can take one apart and you can understand how all the  
**[0:24:25-0:24:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:24:25):**  individual gears work.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:24:27):**  But if I took one apart, I'd never be able to put it back together because I don't understand  
**[0:24:30-0:24:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:24:30):**  the system of how all those pieces work together.  
**[0:24:34-0:24:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:24:34):**  And I think in terms of conservation agriculture and this new philosophy of farming under regenerative  
**[0:24:41-0:24:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:24:41):**  label, there's that problem in the sense that we need some long-term studies that look at  
**[0:24:47-0:24:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:24:47):**  how these pieces interact and work together because there's evidence out there on the  
**[0:24:51-0:24:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:24:51):**  land in real farms that they do work.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:24:53):**  You know, I've dug holes, I've compared the soil structure, compared the soil carbon contents,  
**[0:24:58-0:25:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:24:58):**  the soil life in these farmers' fields and the fields next door, and it's like night  
**[0:25:03-0:25:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:25:03):**  and day.  
**[0:25:04-0:25:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:25:04):**  It would be very useful to have a lot more attention academically on studying that full  
**[0:25:10-0:25:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:25:10):**  system.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:25:11):**  And from what I can tell, it's the emphasis on cultivating the beneficial life in the  
**[0:25:14-0:25:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:25:14):**  soil that's really the catalyst for why it works so well.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:25:17):**  It's interesting you mentioned that actually Sally Caughan, the woman I mentioned before,  
**[0:25:22-0:25:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:25:22):**  really struggled to find, even if they would pay for it, scientists and academics that  
**[0:25:26-0:25:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:25:26):**  wanted to follow the transition on their land because there wasn't a clear one to five-year  
**[0:25:31-0:25:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:25:31):**  plan.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:25:32):**  No, they were going to do it adaptively and looking at what the soil needed year after  
**[0:25:35-0:25:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:25:35):**  year and adapting to that.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:25:37):**  And they were much more comfortable, they being the scientists, looking at their vineyard  
**[0:25:41-0:25:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:25:41):**  that they're starting to grow in a beyond organic way.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:25:46):**  But the normal terrain was just too difficult to grasp because it wasn't a clear we're going  
**[0:25:50-0:25:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:25:50):**  to do this type of vegetables for X amount of years and that's it.  
**[0:25:53-0:25:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:25:53):**  No, they were probably going to be a mix and they're probably going to change it and it's  
**[0:25:57-0:25:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:25:57):**  going to be adaptive.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:25:58):**  So they were really struggling finding people that wanted to study or could study that.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:26:01):**  Yeah, it really challenges the way we think about how to set up scientific experiments  
**[0:26:08-0:26:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:26:08):**  in agriculture, how to evaluate things.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:26:10):**  And it also sort of goes against the grain of the kinds of advice that people give to  
**[0:26:16-0:26:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:26:16):**  farmers.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:26:17):**  If you think about, at least in the United States, the kinds of people who are mostly  
**[0:26:20-0:26:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:26:20):**  advising farmers are usually trying to sell them things and they're trying to sell products,  
**[0:26:25-0:26:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:26:25):**  whether it's an herbicide or a fertilizer or a new piece of equipment.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:26:30):**  And to adopt this new suite of practices, if you are tillage-based, if you're working  
**[0:26:35-0:26:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:26:35):**  with the plow, you do need new equipment, you need no-till planter and John Deere would  
**[0:26:38-0:26:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:26:38):**  be happy to sell you one.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:26:40):**  But the real transformation is in thinking about the land and the practices one adopts.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:26:47):**  And there's very few chemical supply companies that will encourage farmers to adopt practices  
**[0:26:53-0:26:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:26:53):**  that enable them to use far less of their products.  
**[0:26:57-0:27:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:26:57):**  Just like I'm always very suspicious when petrol selling companies are telling you they're  
**[0:27:02-0:27:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:27:02):**  selling you something that uses less of their product.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:27:05):**  Yeah, and there's this sort of classic thing in economics where if the price of an energy  
**[0:27:11-0:27:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:27:11):**  source, for example, goes down, it can often use the, it can basically lead to using far  
**[0:27:17-0:27:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:27:17):**  more of it.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:27:18):**  But yeah, that's, I mean, one of the things that I found interesting coming from a geological  
**[0:27:25-0:27:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:27:25):**  background on all this is, you know, I don't really have, I wasn't trained to believe that  
**[0:27:30-0:27:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:27:30):**  there's a particular way we should be farming or should not be farming.  
**[0:27:34-0:27:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:27:34):**  I sort of came in with an open mind, if you will, I'm not trying to sell anybody anything.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:27:38):**  And I wanted to go and visit farmers and see for myself how they had changed their land.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:27:44):**  And I came away deeply impressed with how fast they've been able to do it.  
**[0:27:49-0:27:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:27:49):**  And that the fundamental underlying thing that changed was how they thought about their  
**[0:27:54-0:27:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:27:54):**  soil.  
**[0:27:55-0:28:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:27:55):**  And so in Growing Revolution, I basically argue that this new way of thinking about  
**[0:28:00-0:28:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:28:00):**  the land and thinking about how to adapt these general principles of farming to particular  
**[0:28:05-0:28:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:28:05):**  places could be the foundation for a new agricultural revolution that's different than the previous  
**[0:28:11-0:28:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:28:11):**  ones because it's about how we think about the land.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:28:15):**  And this regenerative agriculture movement is something I think aligns really well with  
**[0:28:19-0:28:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:28:19):**  it because these principles are the foundation for both.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:28:23):**  And I want to just take one step back on something you mentioned before, the quality of produce  
**[0:28:28-0:28:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:28:28):**  and the quality and the connection between the soil and the life and the biodiversity  
**[0:28:33-0:28:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:28:33):**  in the soil and the life and the biodiversity in us.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:28:36):**  I start to see, but it's mainly because I'm focusing so much on this topic that slowly  
**[0:28:42-0:28:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:28:42):**  we also start to see the connection between the quality we grow with the amount of attention  
**[0:28:48-0:28:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:28:48):**  and the amount of work we put in the soil and the quality of the produce and the amount  
**[0:28:52-0:28:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:28:52):**  of nutrients in it.  
**[0:28:53-0:28:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:28:53):**  Is that something you see as well or is it something I happen to see in a few snippets  
**[0:28:58-0:28:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:28:58):**  around?  
**[0:28:59-0:29:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:28:59):**  No, I think you're onto something.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:29:01):**  My wife Anne and I wrote a book in between the Dirt Book and the Growing Revolution Book.  
**[0:29:05-0:29:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:29:05):**  We wrote one called The Hidden Half of Nature, the Microbial Roots of Life and Health.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:29:09):**  And in that book we started to look into that question in terms of how does healthy fertile  
**[0:29:17-0:29:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:29:17):**  soil influence the way that micronutrients get out of the soil itself and into crops  
**[0:29:23-0:29:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:29:23):**  and then what are the parallels between the functions that a microbiome serves in the  
**[0:29:28-0:29:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:29:28):**  root zone of plants and in the human gut.  
**[0:29:31-0:29:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:29:31):**  And these systems are remarkably similar.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:29:34):**  They're kind of very similar.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:29:35):**  The one is the other inside out.  
**[0:29:38-0:29:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:29:38):**  Probably the lack of research into these systems is also remarkably similar.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:29:42):**  Like what you just described on soil is probably the same on our gut.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:29:48):**  They're very parallel.  
**[0:29:49-0:29:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:29:49):**  And so in The Hidden Half of Nature we went into those parallels, the state of research  
**[0:29:54-0:29:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:29:54):**  in both things.  
**[0:29:55-0:30:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:29:55):**  And what we came away with was the assessment that in terms of the microbial communities  
**[0:30:01-0:30:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:30:01):**  in both systems are serving purposes that are essentially symbiotic with their host  
**[0:30:06-0:30:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:30:06):**  organism whether it's the plant or whether it's a person.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:30:09):**  And they're facilitating nutrient transfer and acquisition particularly of micronutrients  
**[0:30:13-0:30:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:30:13):**  and of the sort of precursors to the microbial metabolites, things the microbes produce that  
**[0:30:20-0:30:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:30:20):**  serve as precursors to things that our body will then make that are necessary for health.  
**[0:30:26-0:30:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:30:26):**  And they also tee up and inform a plant defense system or our immune system and they're involved  
**[0:30:31-0:30:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:30:31):**  in chemical signaling that just sort of helps us navigate our relationship to the external  
**[0:30:35-0:30:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:30:35):**  world.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:30:36):**  And we sort of teed up in that book the question that you're asking of well to what degree  
**[0:30:42-0:30:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:30:42):**  does the way that we grow our food for example influence its nutritional quality for us.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:30:48):**  And Ann and I are now starting to work on a new book together that's going to look pretty  
**[0:30:53-0:31:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:30:53):**  much at that question because there's all kinds of connections between the way that  
**[0:31:00-0:31:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:31:00):**  say the mycorrhizal fungi in the soil help to acquire mineral micronutrients, things  
**[0:31:06-0:31:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:31:06):**  like copper and boron and zinc and iron, things we don't need a lot of in our bodies but that  
**[0:31:13-0:31:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:31:13):**  are absolutely essential to the proper functioning of enzymes and processes in our bodies that  
**[0:31:18-0:31:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:31:18):**  are critical to our health.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:31:21):**  And if you look at what's happened to the micronutrient concentration of food over the  
**[0:31:25-0:31:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:31:25):**  last 50 years, it's dropped radically by a quarter to over half depending which study  
**[0:31:30-0:31:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:31:30):**  you look at and which fruit, vegetable, meat or dairy product you look at.  
**[0:31:34-0:31:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:31:34):**  But the overall trend is that while we've been growing more calories, the quality of  
**[0:31:40-0:31:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:31:40):**  those calories in terms of all the other stuff we need for health have been declining.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:31:46):**  And we're digging into that now to try and look at more into the studies that have actually  
**[0:31:52-0:31:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:31:52):**  addressed that of which there aren't enough that aren't, we could use a lot more attention  
**[0:31:57-0:31:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:31:57):**  to this issue.  
**[0:31:58-0:32:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:31:58):**  We've tended to focus on the question of how do you feed the world with calories and I  
**[0:32:03-0:32:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:32:03):**  think now we need to think a lot more about how do we feed the world with very high quality  
**[0:32:08-0:32:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:32:08):**  nutritious calories.  
**[0:32:10-0:32:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:32:10):**  And looking at that question, I mean you haven't done the research yet on the book, but what  
**[0:32:14-0:32:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:32:14):**  do you think of these vertical farms, hydroponics that take the soil out of the equation and  
**[0:32:20-0:32:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:32:20):**  there are a lot of arguments for it because it uses a lot less water, you can grow it  
**[0:32:23-0:32:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:32:23):**  in cities, etc.  
**[0:32:25-0:32:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:32:25):**  I always have the fear that you just described that we're missing something we cannot measure  
**[0:32:30-0:32:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:32:30):**  yet but we might do in a few years on the nutrient level.  
**[0:32:33-0:32:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:32:33):**  But I don't know if you shared that fear.  
**[0:32:35-0:32:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:32:35):**  That is a really good question.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:32:36):**  I think it's a very legitimate fear and we're hoping to wrestle with that in the new book.  
**[0:32:41-0:32:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:32:41):**  I can't give you a solid opinion on it at the moment because we're still sort of trying  
**[0:32:44-0:32:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:32:44):**  to figure out.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:32:45):**  It's a good cliffhanger.  
**[0:32:46-0:32:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:32:46):**  Oh yeah, it's a bit of a cliffhanger but it's a very well placed concern.  
**[0:32:49-0:32:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:32:49):**  I mean and obviously things like hydroponics are going to be essential for space travel  
**[0:32:53-0:32:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:32:53):**  and things like that.  
**[0:32:55-0:33:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:32:55):**  But whether we should be feeding cities that way depends a lot on where do you get the  
**[0:33:02-0:33:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:33:02):**  micronutrients to put into the hydroponics because if plants are getting a lot of their  
**[0:33:10-0:33:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:33:10):**  mineral micronutrients from the fungi in the soil that extract those elements from the  
**[0:33:15-0:33:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:33:15):**  soil particles, then if you're growing hydroponically, you have to add all those micronutrients yourself.  
**[0:33:20-0:33:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:33:20):**  So where are you getting them from or are you growing micronutrient deficient food if  
**[0:33:25-0:33:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:33:25):**  you're not adding them?  
**[0:33:27-0:33:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:33:27):**  And what's the energetics of how you get that stuff?  
**[0:33:30-0:33:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:33:30):**  If you're having to import copper from South America to feed your vertical farm in New  
**[0:33:34-0:33:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:33:34):**  York, that may not be very efficient whereas instead if you just used the organic matter  
**[0:33:40-0:33:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:33:40):**  that the city produces as garbage every day and composted that back to make soil and then  
**[0:33:46-0:33:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:33:46):**  grew the same food in urban farms in soil, you might have much more nutritious food.  
**[0:33:52-0:33:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:33:52):**  Those are the kind of things that Anne and I are hoping to wrestle with a bit more in  
**[0:33:56-0:33:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:33:56):**  the new book that we're starting to work on.  
**[0:33:59-0:34:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:33:59):**  Extremely interesting.  
**[0:34:01-0:34:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:34:01):**  And you mentioned it a few times, but I'd like to dive a bit deeper into that.  
**[0:34:05-0:34:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:34:05):**  The profitability or the let's say the money side of things.  
**[0:34:09-0:34:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:34:09):**  You visited these farms and you said many of them are doing much better financially  
**[0:34:15-0:34:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:34:15):**  because of the lower inputs, maybe because they can sell quality as well.  
**[0:34:19-0:34:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:34:19):**  That's a separate discussion, but mainly because they are reducing their bills quite dramatically.  
**[0:34:23-0:34:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:34:23):**  Yes, and it was mainly from bill reduction because I visited farms all over the world,  
**[0:34:29-0:34:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:34:29):**  mostly conventional farms because I wanted to look at the question of could we actually  
**[0:34:33-0:34:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:34:33):**  transition modern conventional farms both on subsistence farms in the developing world  
**[0:34:40-0:34:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:34:40):**  and large operations in the developed world.  
**[0:34:42-0:34:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:34:42):**  Could we transition them to much lower input use?  
**[0:34:45-0:34:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:34:45):**  I also visited an organic farm, the Rodale Institute in Pennsylvania to see whether or  
**[0:34:50-0:34:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:34:50):**  not these same principles could work in an organic system and they can.  
**[0:34:55-0:35:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:34:55):**  But I'm mostly conventional farmers in part because that's where the real opportunity  
**[0:35:01-0:35:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:35:01):**  lies to sort of change the world if you will in terms of how humanity tends to farm.  
**[0:35:08-0:35:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:35:08):**  And I was really impressed with how much savings there was from the reduced input use.  
**[0:35:16-0:35:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:35:16):**  If you can reduce the cost of one of your primary costs of production by half or more  
**[0:35:21-0:35:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:35:21):**  in a system, that's going to affect the bottom line of the system as long as it doesn't affect  
**[0:35:26-0:35:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:35:26):**  the output, your productivity.  
**[0:35:29-0:35:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:35:29):**  All the farms that I visited after they'd made this transition were growing increased  
**[0:35:34-0:35:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:35:34):**  yields, not decreased yields.  
**[0:35:36-0:35:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:35:36):**  They were growing more food and spending far less on inputs to do it.  
**[0:35:41-0:35:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:35:41):**  The yield bumps in a few cases were quite significant and most they weren't all that  
**[0:35:45-0:35:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:35:45):**  significant but to me what the significance was is that they didn't lose yield.  
**[0:35:50-0:35:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:35:50):**  They were growing just as much if not more food and so they were basically, in terms  
**[0:35:56-0:36:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:35:56):**  of the effect on the farm's bottom line, the reduced cost of the inputs was money that  
**[0:36:01-0:36:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:36:01):**  went straight to the farmer instead of to his fertilizer dealer.  
**[0:36:04-0:36:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:36:04):**  Which is a nice shift in terms if you look at the farmer, obviously not if you're selling  
**[0:36:09-0:36:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:36:09):**  fertilizer.  
**[0:36:10-0:36:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:36:10):**  Yes, exactly.  
**[0:36:11-0:36:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:36:11):**  With any kind of major transition in thinking or technology, there's going to be winners  
**[0:36:18-0:36:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:36:18):**  and losers.  
**[0:36:19-0:36:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:36:19):**  And from my own perspective, I think it's about time the farmers won.  
**[0:36:22-0:36:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:36:22):**  Yeah, because they spend an insane amount of hours producing our food and many actually,  
**[0:36:28-0:36:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:36:28):**  I saw some data last week, live under the poverty line which is crazy because they cannot  
**[0:36:34-0:36:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:36:34):**  afford their own food if they would sell it.  
**[0:36:37-0:36:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:36:37):**  So one of the main challenges you mentioned for a broader acceptance of regenerative agriculture  
**[0:36:46-0:36:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:36:46):**  or conservation agriculture is crop insurance and policies.  
**[0:36:50-0:36:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:36:50):**  For impact investors, there is of course a lot of lobbying there to do and a lot of work  
**[0:36:54-0:36:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:36:54):**  on the philanthropy side but on the investment side, not too much.  
**[0:36:58-0:37:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:36:58):**  What do you see after visiting all of these farms, both big, small, organic versus non-organic,  
**[0:37:03-0:37:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:37:03):**  what do you see as the role for impact investors or investors in general that want to put money  
**[0:37:09-0:37:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:37:09):**  to work in this space and want to help this transition while making investments?  
**[0:37:13-0:37:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:37:13):**  Well, you know what, there are sort of three big sort of things I think I identified at  
**[0:37:18-0:37:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:37:18):**  the end of the book of sort of opportunities to promote this kind of thing.  
**[0:37:22-0:37:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:37:22):**  One was the crop insurance, the other was looking at setting up demonstration farms  
**[0:37:27-0:37:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:37:27):**  to sort of show farmers how to adapt these practices so they don't have to run the risk  
**[0:37:31-0:37:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:37:31):**  of experimenting on their farm.  
**[0:37:34-0:37:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:37:34):**  Neither of those are probably the best place to point individual or foundation investors  
**[0:37:39-0:37:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:37:39):**  to.  
**[0:37:40-0:37:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:37:40):**  But the third one is where I think there could be big opportunities and that's in transition  
**[0:37:45-0:37:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:37:45):**  assistance and even sort of acquiring farms and leading them down this road of regenerative  
**[0:37:51-0:37:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:37:51):**  agriculture.  
**[0:37:52-0:37:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:37:52):**  There's an awful lot of farmland in the US at least that is leased out and farmed by  
**[0:37:57-0:38:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:37:57):**  people who don't actually own it.  
**[0:38:00-0:38:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:38:00):**  And so there's a problem there and I talk about this historically in the dirt book.  
**[0:38:04-0:38:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:38:04):**  The problem of sort of tenant farmers having an interest, no long term interest in rebuilding  
**[0:38:08-0:38:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:38:08):**  the fertility of their land has been a real problem and I could trace that problem all  
**[0:38:12-0:38:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:38:12):**  the way back to the Roman Empire.  
**[0:38:14-0:38:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:38:14):**  It's been a huge problem in farming for a long time in different areas.  
**[0:38:18-0:38:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:38:18):**  So I've run into some people and organizations that are working with farmers to essentially  
**[0:38:26-0:38:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:38:26):**  purchase farms that have been degraded, farmland that is relatively cheap because the soil  
**[0:38:30-0:38:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:38:30):**  has already been degraded and then buy it and transition it to regenerative farming  
**[0:38:36-0:38:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:38:36):**  and if it can be done profitably in real time but build value in terms of the fertility  
**[0:38:41-0:38:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:38:41):**  of the land over time, to me it looks like a good investment.  
**[0:38:46-0:38:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:38:46):**  There was a time in the 1940s and 50s when farmland was valued by the organic matter  
**[0:38:50-0:38:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:38:50):**  content of its soil.  
**[0:38:52-0:38:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:38:52):**  How fertile is the land?  
**[0:38:55-0:39:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:38:55):**  And now we value it by how much, what we can harvest with large agrochemical inputs.  
**[0:39:00-0:39:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:39:00):**  It's been sort of divorced from the native fertility of the land.  
**[0:39:04-0:39:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:39:04):**  As we look out to what's going to form the value in farmland in 20, 30, 50 years from  
**[0:39:10-0:39:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:39:10):**  now as we try and transition off of our overreliance on fossil fuels, land that you can farm intensively  
**[0:39:18-0:39:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:39:18):**  and produce a lot of food on without using a lot of those inputs that will in all likelihood  
**[0:39:23-0:39:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:39:23):**  get more expensive through the rest of this century.  
**[0:39:26-0:39:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:39:26):**  That seems to me is a real investment opportunity.  
**[0:39:29-0:39:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:39:29):**  No, definitely.  
**[0:39:31-0:39:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:39:31):**  Looking at especially long term focus.  
**[0:39:34-0:39:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:39:34):**  That's the key here in general.  
**[0:39:35-0:39:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:39:35):**  It's the key for any farmer that wants to leave the land maybe to their children or  
**[0:39:40-0:39:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:39:40):**  to any generation after the land.  
**[0:39:44-0:39:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:39:44):**  And that's the perspective.  
**[0:39:45-0:39:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:39:45):**  As a geologist I can't help but come from that perspective because to me if we could  
**[0:39:49-0:39:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:39:49):**  make this transition in 30 years that's remarkably fast.  
**[0:39:53-0:39:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:39:53):**  You think it's centuries normally or even longer.  
**[0:39:56-0:40:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:39:56):**  Yeah, centuries are round off error in terms of geologic time.  
**[0:40:01-0:40:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:40:01):**  But we don't have centuries to solve this problem.  
**[0:40:03-0:40:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:40:03):**  We need to do it much faster.  
**[0:40:05-0:40:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:40:05):**  And that's where I'm hoping that these kinds of ideas catch on and spread among farmers  
**[0:40:12-0:40:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:40:12):**  around the world.  
**[0:40:13-0:40:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:40:13):**  I was just at a conference yesterday back east where I was introduced to a gentleman  
**[0:40:19-0:40:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:40:19):**  from Cornell who had used ideas like this in terms of building more productive rice  
**[0:40:27-0:40:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:40:27):**  systems in Asia and had had great success not only in growing more food with less inputs  
**[0:40:33-0:40:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:40:33):**  but in growing food that had better micronutrient density.  
**[0:40:38-0:40:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:40:38):**  And so I think that hopefully we're on the cusp of really rethinking how we do agriculture.  
**[0:40:44-0:40:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:40:44):**  Which hopefully even means that you need less of it if there's more in it that you need.  
**[0:40:50-0:40:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:40:50):**  Less empty calories and more nutrient ones which would help even more in this equation  
**[0:40:54-0:40:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:40:54):**  because we still have to feed probably 9-10 billion people.  
**[0:40:57-0:40:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:40:57):**  So final question.  
**[0:40:59-0:41:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:40:59):**  Let's imagine there's a gigantic room full of impact investors listening to this podcast.  
**[0:41:05-0:41:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:41:05):**  They're all interested.  
**[0:41:06-0:41:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:41:06):**  They are on board.  
**[0:41:07-0:41:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:41:07):**  They want to get into the regenerative agriculture space, into conservation.  
**[0:41:11-0:41:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:41:11):**  They want to put their money to work.  
**[0:41:13-0:41:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:41:13):**  What would be your piece of advice, obviously not investment advice, but what would be your  
**[0:41:19-0:41:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:41:19):**  piece of advice?  
**[0:41:20-0:41:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:41:20):**  Where to start?  
**[0:41:21-0:41:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:41:21):**  What would be the first step for you?  
**[0:41:22-0:41:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:41:22):**  You mean other than supporting us to write the next book?  
**[0:41:26-0:41:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:41:26):**  Buying the book is a first.  
**[0:41:27-0:41:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:41:27):**  But they've read the book, they've bought the book, they've bought 10 copies for their  
**[0:41:30-0:41:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:41:30):**  friends and now they want to do something with their investment capital.  
**[0:41:35-0:41:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:41:35):**  Well you know I think that if there's looking at how to partner with or put together networks  
**[0:41:40-0:41:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:41:40):**  of people to look at either providing transition assistance to farmers whether in terms of  
**[0:41:45-0:41:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:41:45):**  short-term loans for new equipment that they needed to buy or just sort of financially  
**[0:41:50-0:41:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:41:50):**  backstopping someone taking the risk of a transition and you know anytime you change  
**[0:41:54-0:41:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:41:54):**  practices there's at least a perceived if not real risk.  
**[0:41:59-0:42:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:41:59):**  And that's the bottom part of the hockey stick.  
**[0:42:04-0:42:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:42:04):**  But also sort of thinking about what the opportunities are for partnering with farmers to take degraded  
**[0:42:13-0:42:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:42:13):**  land and turn it back into productivity.  
**[0:42:16-0:42:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:42:16):**  Something like a third of the world's farmland has already been abandoned due to soil degradation.  
**[0:42:21-0:42:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:42:21):**  That problem of feeding the world you mentioned of the 9 or 10 billion person planet would  
**[0:42:25-0:42:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:42:25):**  be a whole lot easier if we restore the degraded farmland around the world.  
**[0:42:29-0:42:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:42:29):**  So I'd encourage people to think about the model of trying to acquire farmland that has  
**[0:42:35-0:42:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:42:35):**  been degraded and turn it around.  
**[0:42:40-0:42:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:42:40):**  Basically rebuild its fertility and turn it back into a net asset.  
**[0:42:44-0:42:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:42:44):**  I think that's amazing advice.  
**[0:42:46-0:42:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:42:46):**  Thank you so much David for sharing.  
**[0:42:48-0:42:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:42:48):**  I would definitely be checking in when the new book comes out because I think it's one  
**[0:42:52-0:42:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:42:52):**  of those pillars or one of the lags of the stool we're missing or we're going to hear  
**[0:42:56-0:43:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:42:56):**  a lot more about if we would talk in a year from now.  
**[0:43:00-0:43:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:43:00):**  A lot of the things we discuss would be quite obvious.  
**[0:43:02-0:43:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:43:02):**  So I'll be checking in and I'll be following you and thank you so much for your time this  
**[0:43:07-0:43:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:43:07):**  morning.  
**[0:43:08-0:43:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:43:08):**  I know it's very early.  
**[0:43:09-0:43:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:43:09):**  Great, well thanks.  
**[0:43:10-0:43:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:43:10):**  I appreciate it.  
**[0:43:11-0:43:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:43:11):**  It's a pleasure to talk and if anyone's interested in following us on Twitter we are active there  
**[0:43:15-0:43:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:43:15):**  with our tag of at dig then the number 2 and grow at dig2grow.  
**[0:43:21-0:43:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:43:21):**  And we can keep people updated on stuff we learn along the way and about when the new  
**[0:43:25-0:43:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/#t=0:43:25):**  book will come out.

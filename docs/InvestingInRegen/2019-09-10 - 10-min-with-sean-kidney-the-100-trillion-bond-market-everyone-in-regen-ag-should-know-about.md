### Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food  (Tue, 10 Sep 2019 15:30:06)
## 10 min with Sean Kidney, the $100 trillion bond market everyone in regen ag should know about  
**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:00:00):**  You're listening to the summary of the interview. For a link to the full-length episode, please check the description below.  
**[0:00:09-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:00:09):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture, Investing as if the Planet Mattered,  
**[0:00:14-0:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:00:14):**  a podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:19-0:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:00:19):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities and ecosystems  
**[0:00:26-0:00:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:00:26):**  while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:29-0:00:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:00:29):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration? Because so many of the pressing issues we face today  
**[0:00:34-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:00:34):**  have their roots in how we treat our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:00:38-0:00:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:00:38):**  And it's time that we, as investors, big and small, and consumers, start paying much more attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:00:47-0:00:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:00:47):**  Before we get started, I've been recording these interviews next to my day job and I will definitely continue to do so  
**[0:00:53-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:00:53):**  and release about an episode a month. But at the same time, I would love to take this further,  
**[0:00:58-0:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:00:58):**  share more interviews, there are many more stories to share on investing in regenerative food and agriculture,  
**[0:01:03-0:01:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:01:03):**  more depth, improve the quality, maybe even doing some video series.  
**[0:01:08-0:01:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:01:08):**  So I started a Patreon community, which makes it easy to support creators like myself.  
**[0:01:12-0:01:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:01:12):**  If these podcasts have been of value to you and if you have the means, I invite you to support me and make this happen.  
**[0:01:19-0:01:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:01:19):**  For more information, please find the link to my Patreon account in the description below.  
**[0:01:24-0:01:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:01:24):**  And now, without further ado, the interview. Enjoy!  
**[0:01:30-0:01:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:01:30):**  Today, I'm interviewing Sean Kidney, co-founder of the Climate Bonds Initiative.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:01:34):**  An international investor-focused, non-for-profit, they are the only organisation working solely on mobilising the 100 trillion,  
**[0:01:40-0:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:01:40):**  yes, that's a T, bond market for climate change solutions. Welcome Sean!  
**[0:01:45-0:01:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:01:45):**  It is a U-turn, it is no longer a right-hand-held turn because of the extent to which emissions have gone up in the last 30 years.  
**[0:01:52-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:01:52):**  We've put in more CO2 into the atmosphere in the last 30 years than the previous 150 years, while we've been talking about it, of course.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:02:00):**  So that's what we've faced with. Now, if you need to make this kind of change in the economy, on a planet, in society,  
**[0:02:07-0:02:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:02:07):**  there are large capital needs, is to make sure that the people are not just  
**[0:02:10-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:02:10):**  a very high-cap-ex part, take solar, low-op-ex, high-cap-ex.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:02:15):**  That means a lot of capital upfront, that means interest rates are critical for these investments.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:02:24):**  Bond markets are about $100 trillion, outstanding globally. Equity markets are $60 trillion.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:02:30):**  It gives you a flavour of difference. Bond markets are pension funds in the form of a bond.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:02:36):**  Bond markets are pension funds, insurance, government bodies, banks.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:02:42):**  These are different types of investors to equity investors a lot of the time.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:02:47):**  They tend not to be watching the stock, the S&P every day, especially amongst institutional investors  
**[0:02:54-0:03:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:02:54):**  that have a long-term appetite, pension funds and insurance funds. There are a lot of buy-and-hold investors.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:03:00):**  Now, if you're trying to do a CapEx investment with a long return on investment profile,  
**[0:03:06-0:03:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:03:06):**  this is the perfect investor class for you. And we need to get them into the game.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:03:12):**  At the moment, they're only marginally exposed to what I call solution sectors.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:03:17):**  And in the sectors that need to become solution sectors, we need to change practices,  
**[0:03:23-0:03:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:03:23):**  they're not largely aware of what's involved. In other words, they can't differentiate between a water utility  
**[0:03:29-0:03:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:03:29):**  that is doing capital investment, which is climate ready versus capital investment, which is not climate ready  
**[0:03:36-0:03:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:03:36):**  and frankly might fail anyway as it becomes a credit risk because of the weather volatility, we're going into the rainfall volatility.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:03:43):**  We can't afford a niche market here. We have to be able to engage the mainstream portfolio managers around the world.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:03:51):**  So these bonds walk and talk like an ordinary bond, similar yield, similar coupon.  
**[0:03:56-0:04:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:03:56):**  The distinguishing feature is a promise by the issuer, governed by a national framework,  
**[0:04:03-0:04:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:04:03):**  to allocate the proceeds to qualifying investments, which will come back to qualifying investments later.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:04:08):**  And now we've got about $600 billion dollars outstanding of these globally and at rapidly growing markets.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:04:17):**  Can you give a short overview of where we are in terms of climate bonds and land use and agriculture?  
**[0:04:23-0:04:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:04:23):**  Well, clearly from a climate perspective, the agricultural sector is so important.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:04:31):**  In Europe, agriculture is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions, for example.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:04:38):**  Working with the agriculture sector is a vital thing now. There are many things to be done with direct investment.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:04:45):**  We're not going to stop deforestation by investing in a forest. There are many attempts to do red two bonds and so on.  
**[0:04:51-0:05:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:04:51):**  But the cash flows aren't there. There we have to look at the economic development of the society around the natural capital assets.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:05:00):**  And how do we make those richer and have a different economic path than the destruction of capital assets?  
**[0:05:06-0:05:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:05:06):**  That's the challenge. I'm separating out the bond issuance from the environmental challenge first.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:05:11):**  The first thing to do is to identify activities that achieve our outcome.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:05:15):**  Once you've done that, then you look at the potential for bond issuance in an area.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:05:19):**  Agriculture sector will always be relatively small in bond issuance.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:05:23):**  The big sectors will be infrastructure and buildings and energy.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:05:28):**  But it's critically important from an emissions perspective.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:05:31):**  So what I'm trying to say is that preservation of national capital is one.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:05:35):**  The increase in sequestration of soils and the regrowth of forests is another.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:05:41):**  As you would know more than most, the potential for soil sequestration is huge.  
**[0:05:45-0:05:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:05:45):**  The changing of practices to reduce emissions at a farmer level is also important.  
**[0:05:54-0:05:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:05:54):**  In the bond space, you need to be a reasonably large institution.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:05:57):**  That means a government, a bank or a corporation to be able to do this.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:06:01):**  And then the money trickles down through their processes to smallest landholders or whatever.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:06:06):**  You're not going to be a coffee farmer in Ghana and be able to issue a bond realistically.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:06:10):**  But you might get a green loan from a microfinance company who is able to issue a bond to refinance its portfolio of loans.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:06:22):**  One is the first thing is carbon measuring and improving carbon stocks.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:06:27):**  If people can show evidence that they're doing that, bingo, that's going to be part of the solution.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:06:33):**  However, that's very difficult, not happening very often.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:06:35):**  So what we've ended up doing is having a basket of practices which are relatively short term in nature,  
**[0:06:43-0:06:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:06:43):**  but are seen to be consistent with improving carbon stocks.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:06:47):**  You know, zero tilling agriculture, for example, as seen from open plough.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:06:51):**  In Europe, if people can show that they are using that basket of practices,  
**[0:06:59-0:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:06:59):**  which are effectively proxies for the four activities that are all descriptions of activities that will improve carbon stocks,  
**[0:07:05-0:07:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:07:05):**  then that will count for the taxonomy.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:07:08):**  In other words, they'll be able to get access to green loans.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:07:11):**  If they're a large agricultural organisation, they can do green bonds.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:07:14):**  That's how we're tackling it. It's very early days.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:07:21):**  Well, my point more was that we need to look at resilience.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:07:24):**  Resilience is actually more than just resilience against weather.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:07:27):**  It's about our ecosystem resilience.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:07:30):**  You know, complex systems, if they're hollowed out, collapse quickly and don't recover.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:07:37):**  We have hollowed out our global ecosystems.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:07:41):**  We need to work to make them more resilient by improving their biodiversity,  
**[0:07:47-0:07:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:07:47):**  by improving their ability to be able to respond to extreme climatic shocks and weather shocks.  
**[0:07:54-0:07:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:07:54):**  That's essentially it.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:07:56):**  One of those issues is the use of artificial substances.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:08:00):**  We know that when you release a lot of antibiotics into the ecosystem, all sorts of changes happen.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:08:12):**  I think it comes back nicely to the point of the need of transition finance,  
**[0:08:18-0:08:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:08:18):**  because these farmers, these land users, they can get off these substances for the most part,  
**[0:08:23-0:08:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:08:23):**  and in some cases even completely, but they need, through that phase of,  
**[0:08:28-0:08:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:08:28):**  some people say five, some people say ten years, some people say three, depends on the land,  
**[0:08:31-0:08:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:08:31):**  of course, what it's been used for, but they need to be helped.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:08:35):**  And actually climate bonds at the large scale or transition finance on the more local scale  
**[0:08:40-0:08:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:08:40):**  is needed for many to go through the path of a number of years of getting off the drugs  
**[0:08:47-0:08:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:08:47):**  and basically revitalising the land or actually making it adaptive again or making it actually alive again.  
**[0:08:54-0:08:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:08:54):**  What we're working around globally is to make those loans cheaper.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:08:57):**  With developer banks providing credit support, with governments providing regulatory support,  
**[0:09:03-0:09:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:09:03):**  the lending to the green sector will be materially cheaper than lending to non-green sectors.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:09:10):**  So you'll have your direct financial incentive.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:09:12):**  Now you might be a farmer in somewhere like Italy and you're concerned about these issues,  
**[0:09:17-0:09:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/07/10/sean-kidney/#t=0:09:17):**  but you're trapped because you try to raise money and run something in a marginal way.

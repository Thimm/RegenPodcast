**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:00:14):**  You're going to listen to an interview with Ramis Kent, a permaculture expert who has  
**[0:00:18-0:00:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:00:18):**  taught courses all around the world.  
**[0:00:20-0:00:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:00:20):**  He's on a mission to show the traditional finance world that it is possible to restore  
**[0:00:24-0:00:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:00:24):**  large ecosystems and create meaningful returns for society, the planet and financially.  
**[0:00:29-0:00:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:00:29):**  We talked about the differences between a true investor and a gambler, or someone who  
**[0:00:33-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:00:33):**  is just speculating, and his involvement in the ecosystem restoration camps, who started  
**[0:00:38-0:00:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:00:38):**  this year in Spain but are already expanding.  
**[0:00:41-0:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:00:41):**  Enjoy!  
**[0:00:42-0:00:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:00:42):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture, Investing as if the  
**[0:00:48-0:00:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:00:48):**  Planet Mattered, a podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and  
**[0:00:52-0:00:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:00:52):**  agriculture space to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil,  
**[0:00:57-0:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:00:57):**  people, local communities and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:01:03):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:06-0:01:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:01:06):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:09-0:01:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:01:09):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:12-0:01:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:01:12):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:17-0:01:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:01:17):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:01:22):**  Before we get started, I've been recording these interviews next to my day job and I  
**[0:01:26-0:01:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:01:26):**  will definitely continue to do so and release about an episode a month.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:01:29):**  But at the same time I would love to take this further, share more interviews, there  
**[0:01:33-0:01:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:01:33):**  are many more stories to share on investing in regenerative food and agriculture, more  
**[0:01:38-0:01:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:01:38):**  depth, improve the quality, maybe even doing some video series.  
**[0:01:42-0:01:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:01:42):**  So I started a Patreon community which makes it easy to support creators like myself.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:01:47):**  If these podcasts have been of value to you and if you have the means, I invite you to  
**[0:01:51-0:01:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:01:51):**  support me and make this happen.

**[0:01:59-0:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:01:59):**  And now, without further ado, the interview.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:02:02):**  Enjoy!  
**[0:02:04-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:02:04):**  Welcome to Investing in Regenerative Agriculture, Investing as if the Planet Mattered.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:02:07):**  I'm Kun van Zeyen, your host, and in the podcast of today I'm joined by Ramis Kent.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:02:11):**  Ramis is a permaculture consultant who has taught courses everywhere including Jordan,  
**[0:02:15-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:02:15):**  Palestine, Occupied West Bank, Greece, Ethiopia, Yemen and Turkey, and this is only a short  
**[0:02:20-0:02:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:02:20):**  list.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:02:21):**  Ramis is also a board member of the Ecosystem Restoration Camps Foundation which we're  
**[0:02:25-0:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:02:25):**  going to cover later.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:02:26):**  Welcome, Ramis.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:02:27):**  Thank you, Komen.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:02:28):**  So to start with a personal question, how do you end up on the land in permaculture,  
**[0:02:33-0:02:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:02:33):**  in regenerative agriculture?  
**[0:02:34-0:02:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:02:34):**  How did you get there?  
**[0:02:36-0:02:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:02:36):**  That's a long story, but I'll try to give you the short version.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:02:43):**  My formal background is actually in mechanical engineering.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:02:48):**  So this seems to be, I think at first glance, a bit incongruous.  
**[0:02:54-0:03:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:02:54):**  But I had worked for a number of years in research development work, mostly with medical  
**[0:03:01-0:03:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:03:01):**  devices.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:03:02):**  I did a year of aerospace engineering in the Bay Area and also in New England.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:03:10):**  Actually one of my former employers is the gentleman who invented the Segway, Dean Kamen,  
**[0:03:16-0:03:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:03:16):**  who was my first job out of college.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:03:21):**  Not very useful on the farm, I think.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:03:23):**  There's an off-terrain version.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:03:27):**  There is an off-road version.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:03:28):**  Yeah, I've seen that.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:03:29):**  I haven't ridden it.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:03:30):**  I would like to, but I did the normal version.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:03:34):**  But they got to a point where I just got tired of working in an office.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:03:42):**  And it wasn't necessarily what I saw myself doing.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:03:47):**  I think there are definitely aspects of engineering work that appeal to me.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:03:52):**  But there was just something else I felt like I needed to be doing.  
**[0:03:55-0:04:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:03:55):**  So I taught a couple of years of high school in Oakland, California.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:04:00):**  I worked for about six months on a tugboat on San Francisco Bay, which was interesting.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:04:05):**  I always joked that if I knew about that 20 years earlier, maybe I might still be working  
**[0:04:09-0:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:04:09):**  on a tugboat.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:04:12):**  But I eventually, during the course of my teaching, I was asked to be an administrator  
**[0:04:19-0:04:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:04:19):**  for an Arabic language course being held at the campus of UC Berkeley.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:04:26):**  And one of the students in the course, interestingly enough, used to work for Jeff Lawton, who  
**[0:04:32-0:04:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:04:32):**  is the managing director of the Permaculture Research Institute.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:04:36):**  She worked for him for about three years.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:04:39):**  And it was through her that I became introduced to permaculture.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:04:43):**  I didn't even know what it was.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:04:44):**  She asked me, do you know what permaculture is?  
**[0:04:46-0:04:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:04:46):**  I said, no.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:04:47):**  And then she showed me the Greening the Desert video, which at the time had just been released,  
**[0:04:52-0:04:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:04:52):**  I believe, or at least it hadn't been out for long.  
**[0:04:56-0:05:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:04:56):**  And I said, at the moment I saw it, I said, I have to do this.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:05:01):**  And Jeff happened to be coming to the Bay Area probably about a week after she had shown  
**[0:05:06-0:05:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:05:06):**  me that video.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:05:07):**  And I went to go meet him with a group of people.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:05:11):**  And I came to find out that he knew some old friends of mine.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:05:15):**  And there are a couple of other coincidental things that really confirmed for me that I  
**[0:05:21-0:05:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:05:21):**  needed to go and spend some time with him.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:05:23):**  So eventually I went down to Australia to his farm, Zaytuna Farm, to take a number of  
**[0:05:31-0:05:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:05:31):**  classes with him and to do an internship.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:05:35):**  And then also during that time, I was able to participate in a couple of consultancies,  
**[0:05:40-0:05:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:05:40):**  which my engineering background had helped in that regard in doing the things necessary  
**[0:05:47-0:05:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:05:47):**  to perform some of those tasks associated with consultancy.  
**[0:05:53-0:06:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:05:53):**  And by the time I was heading back to the States, I told him, I want to work with you,  
**[0:06:02-0:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:06:02):**  whatever you're doing.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:06:03):**  I want to help out.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:06:05):**  And since then, I've become a co-director at the Permaculture Research Institute.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:06:13):**  And part of the consulting team that Jeff's put together called Permaculture Sustainable  
**[0:06:21-0:06:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:06:21):**  Consulting Proprietary Limited.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:06:24):**  And I've since become involved with a number of other efforts, including the Ecosystem  
**[0:06:29-0:06:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:06:29):**  Restoration Camps Foundation, the World Permaculture Association, which was started by one of my  
**[0:06:36-0:06:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:06:36):**  students in Italy, Giuseppe Tallarico.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:06:40):**  Also another student from that region, Ignacio Scutini, he went on to start the Medipur Lab  
**[0:06:49-0:06:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:06:49):**  or Permacultura Mediterranea, which is also based in Italy.  
**[0:06:54-0:06:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:06:54):**  There are a number of efforts which have come out of the work that I've been able to do  
**[0:06:59-0:07:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:06:59):**  over the last several years.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:07:01):**  It's easily one of the best decisions I ever made was getting involved with this because  
**[0:07:06-0:07:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:07:06):**  there's so much to be done.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:07:08):**  And you really feel like you're doing work that matters.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:07:13):**  You could have still been on the talk mode, which is also work that needs to be done.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:07:17):**  But this is probably for all of us, was a better choice.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:07:21):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:07:22):**  Yeah, definitely for me.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:07:23):**  Yes, absolutely.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:07:24):**  Yeah, I can imagine also for humanity as a whole.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:07:27):**  But I would like to frame this discussion around, I mean, the series is called Investing  
**[0:07:32-0:07:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:07:32):**  in Regenerative Agriculture.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:07:34):**  We've had a bit of a pre discussion on a number of things.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:07:37):**  And I would love to dive deeper into that, what you see, you've worked with the financial  
**[0:07:42-0:07:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:07:42):**  world, you're in a lot of conversations with the financial investment industry, etc.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:07:47):**  And you're working on the ground.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:07:48):**  And I think it's a very interesting perspective to look at both sides and see what's necessary.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:07:52):**  And I would love to start and then we also will cover, of course, the camps, ecosystem  
**[0:07:57-0:08:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:07:57):**  restoration camps you mentioned before as a nice example of what's possible and putting  
**[0:08:03-0:08:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:08:03):**  that to work.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:08:04):**  But I think we'd like to start with a focused question that we've discussed before.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:08:08):**  What is an investor to you?  
**[0:08:10-0:08:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:08:10):**  And if a group of investors is listening to this podcast, who should be considered investor?  
**[0:08:16-0:08:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:08:16):**  Who should they consider themselves as investor or not?  
**[0:08:19-0:08:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:08:19):**  What for you does the word investor in this modern world and in the agricultural world  
**[0:08:24-0:08:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:08:24):**  of the future mean?  
**[0:08:25-0:08:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:08:25):**  Well, I mean, this is a very complex question, very complex issue, very multifaceted.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:08:39):**  And I mean, this is something that I first started looking at several years ago.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:08:43):**  I mean, I had the good fortune of becoming involved with a group called TBLI, Triple  
**[0:08:50-0:08:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:08:50):**  Bottom Line Investment or investors.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:08:53):**  I was headed up through with Rubenstein.  
**[0:08:56-0:08:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:08:56):**  Yeah, right.  
**[0:08:57-0:08:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:08:57):**  Okay.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:08:58):**  So several years ago, I was introduced to Robert.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:09:01):**  And this, interestingly enough, came from a connection with the Mazda City project in  
**[0:09:10-0:09:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:09:10):**  Abu Dhabi.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:09:11):**  And during the time that I spent in Australia, Jeff had received a call from a large consulting  
**[0:09:18-0:09:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:09:18):**  entity that was competing for a part of the one of the contracts connected to the development  
**[0:09:24-0:09:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:09:24):**  of that project.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:09:26):**  And I had helped in getting some material together that eventually won the contract  
**[0:09:33-0:09:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:09:33):**  for the company that had called on Jeff to lend some help in putting together some ideas.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:09:40):**  And what had occurred to me then was, you know, well, the people that won the contract,  
**[0:09:45-0:09:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:09:45):**  like this is not the type of design work that they are accustomed to doing.  
**[0:09:51-0:09:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:09:51):**  Like this is not an area of expertise for them.  
**[0:09:53-0:09:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:09:53):**  And essentially, the way they won the contract was they took the information that was given  
**[0:09:57-0:10:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:09:57):**  to them and they kind of dressed it up in a nice front end package.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:10:02):**  Nice PowerPoint.  
**[0:10:03-0:10:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:10:03):**  Right.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:10:04):**  Nice PowerPoint, renderings, all the rest of it.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:10:07):**  And what I said to Jeff was, we really need to see about trying to put together a consulting  
**[0:10:12-0:10:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:10:12):**  outfit that can compete for that kind of work.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:10:16):**  This is an indication that there is a niche in the consulting market that is not being  
**[0:10:22-0:10:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:10:22):**  filled by the current players that are out there.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:10:26):**  So this is back in 2009 when we first started talking about this in particular.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:10:34):**  And so the involvement of TBLI kind of came out of that experience.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:10:41):**  And what we were attempting to do when I went on an investor salon tour in 2010 to try to  
**[0:10:48-0:10:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:10:48):**  speak to investment people about this opportunity of doing ecosystem restoration work, or what  
**[0:10:54-0:10:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:10:54):**  I had called at the time, earth repair work.  
**[0:10:57-0:11:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:10:57):**  And that by investing in trying to recover portions of the globe that are effectively  
**[0:11:06-0:11:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:11:06):**  no longer functional, that this is a way to be able to provide added value.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:11:12):**  Like for instance, during the time of the real estate boom, when people would buy dilapidated  
**[0:11:19-0:11:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:11:19):**  properties, they would invest in the refurbishing of a house and then you would sell the house  
**[0:11:23-0:11:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:11:23):**  for many times what it was that you had bought it for.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:11:26):**  In this instance, you're seeing a very similar principle, similar idea at work where you're  
**[0:11:32-0:11:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:11:32):**  taking land that's no longer functional, you sort of fix it, and then you could put it  
**[0:11:37-0:11:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:11:37):**  back on the market either for an increased value or you're able to reap the benefits  
**[0:11:42-0:11:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:11:42):**  of the services that are provided by these functional landscapes again.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:11:48):**  This was something that I thought had a very high degree of attraction and great market  
**[0:11:56-0:11:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:11:56):**  potential because-  
**[0:11:57-0:11:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:11:57):**  Really see the land as the product.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:11:59):**  Where the land is the product, not what's produced from the land.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:12:03):**  But the actual land is-  
**[0:12:05-0:12:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:12:05):**  Underlying asset.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:12:06):**  Exactly.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:12:07):**  It's sort of the primary asset from which the derivatives, what's produced from land  
**[0:12:13-0:12:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:12:13):**  are made possible.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:12:14):**  And so this is something that John Liu, for instance, this is one of the great commonalities  
**[0:12:21-0:12:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:12:21):**  that we had in terms of the interest, the common interest that we had seen when we met  
**[0:12:25-0:12:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:12:25):**  one another was this idea that land is sort of the primary, most important asset that  
**[0:12:31-0:12:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:12:31):**  we have.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:12:32):**  And that it's a logical fallacy to believe that the derivatives, the things that are  
**[0:12:37-0:12:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:12:37):**  actually produced from land has more value than the land itself.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:12:42):**  And that is presently the way that I think most investment people, that this is the way  
**[0:12:49-0:12:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:12:49):**  they look at the world is that you're almost, you're essentially cannibalizing the body,  
**[0:12:55-0:13:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:12:55):**  if you will, sort of harvesting the organs of the body, the terrestrial body and placing  
**[0:13:01-0:13:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:13:01):**  value on the organs and completely disregarding the body.  
**[0:13:06-0:13:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:13:06):**  And if you are removing too many of the vital organs from the body, you eventually kill  
**[0:13:12-0:13:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:13:12):**  the body.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:13:13):**  So you're an extractor, not an investor or an entrepreneur.  
**[0:13:16-0:13:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:13:16):**  Right.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:13:17):**  You're an extractor, not an investor.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:13:18):**  You're basically making, you're making money from harvesting organs.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:13:22):**  Almost wildly wild harvesting instead of properly farming or instead of making sure that the  
**[0:13:28-0:13:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:13:28):**  body between brackets that you're taking it from has the capacity to regenerate.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:13:33):**  Right.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:13:34):**  Exactly.  
**[0:13:35-0:13:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:13:35):**  I mean, what we really should be encouraging is a type of husbandry.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:13:40):**  You know, and husbandry is really about partnership.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:13:43):**  You form a partnership, something that is mutually beneficial.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:13:47):**  And really, you're doing this out of a sense of an enlightened self-interest, realizing  
**[0:13:53-0:14:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:13:53):**  that if the moment you diminish the functional capability of landscape or an ecosystem or  
**[0:14:01-0:14:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:14:01):**  some sort of ecological infrastructure, you diminish yourself because you are a part of  
**[0:14:07-0:14:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:14:07):**  that system.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:14:08):**  You are a part of that infrastructure and that, you know, you're literally pulling the  
**[0:14:13-0:14:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:14:13):**  rug out from underneath your feet.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:14:16):**  And so if that understanding can be inculcated into people that have the capital, which enables,  
**[0:14:25-0:14:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:14:25):**  you know, the economic activity that dictates the world within which they live.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:14:31):**  Just to be clear, the financial capital.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:14:33):**  Exactly.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:14:34):**  So in particular, the financial capital and that financial capital is being used to enable  
**[0:14:38-0:14:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:14:38):**  certain types of activity with regard to our interaction with living capital and natural  
**[0:14:44-0:14:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:14:44):**  capital or ecosystem capital.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:14:48):**  And if you can use financial capital to regenerate those things or to make them better as opposed  
**[0:14:55-0:15:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:14:55):**  to making them worse, then you're able to prolong your ability to be able to have some  
**[0:15:02-0:15:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:15:02):**  sort of regenerative, beneficial economic activity that is not predicated on extraction,  
**[0:15:08-0:15:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:15:08):**  you know, which eventually you just get to the point where there's nothing left to extract.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:15:12):**  And at this point in history, you know, we're living on a planet with, again, a limited  
**[0:15:18-0:15:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:15:18):**  number of resources that are becoming less and less available and viable by the day.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:15:25):**  And unless we change the way in which we think about how we invest in things and how we generate  
**[0:15:30-0:15:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:15:30):**  economic activity, we don't change that in relatively short order.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:15:34):**  There's going to be nothing left to extract.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:15:37):**  And so if that's the way people make money, how do you make money when the source of your  
**[0:15:44-0:15:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:15:44):**  ability to make money is no longer available?  
**[0:15:46-0:15:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:15:46):**  And have you seen since you started talking with TVLI in 2009, 2010, have you seen a change  
**[0:15:54-0:16:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:15:54):**  in the amount or the number of investors that are seeing this, maybe the way they're investing?  
**[0:16:02-0:16:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:16:02):**  Has that changed in the last eight years?  
**[0:16:04-0:16:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:16:04):**  And if so, how?  
**[0:16:06-0:16:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:16:06):**  I think some of the language, I think the way people are talking about these kinds of  
**[0:16:13-0:16:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:16:13):**  things is changing.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:16:15):**  However, I think the direction in which investment is being directed and the degree to which  
**[0:16:24-0:16:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:16:24):**  investment is being directed as far as the financial capital is made available, it's  
**[0:16:29-0:16:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:16:29):**  still not ending up in the places that it needs to end up in order to affect the type  
**[0:16:34-0:16:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:16:34):**  of ends I think people in our camp have in mind.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:16:40):**  And I think a great deal of this has to do with the nature of the investment cycles that  
**[0:16:46-0:16:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:16:46):**  most people, most investment people are used to dealing with.  
**[0:16:50-0:16:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:16:50):**  There's certain markets or there's certain ways in which investors are accustomed to  
**[0:16:55-0:16:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:16:55):**  being able to realize financial returns.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:16:58):**  They're just vehicles that they're used to dealing with.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:17:03):**  And the investment cycles, which are often connected to some sort of intellectual property  
**[0:17:07-0:17:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:17:07):**  or proprietary technology, some sort of discrete product that can be financialized, that's  
**[0:17:15-0:17:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:17:15):**  not necessarily what we're talking about when we're discussing things like ecosystem restoration  
**[0:17:21-0:17:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:17:21):**  or land restoration or rehabilitation or earth repair work.  
**[0:17:27-0:17:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:17:27):**  Instead of investment cycles that are along the lines of several months or sometime maybe  
**[0:17:36-0:17:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:17:36):**  within a year or a couple of years, we're really looking at one to two decades that  
**[0:17:44-0:17:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:17:44):**  we need people to stay engaged.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:17:47):**  Most long-term funds are seven to 10 years and you're lucky if you can add one or two  
**[0:17:52-0:17:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:17:52):**  extra so you're at 12.  
**[0:17:54-0:17:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:17:54):**  Then you're just getting started.  
**[0:17:57-0:17:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:17:57):**  Then you're restoring ecosystems.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:17:59):**  So you're just getting in the game as far as what most people would think of as quote  
**[0:18:06-0:18:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:18:06):**  unquote long-term investment, as you said, seven to 10 years.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:18:10):**  When we look at the Common Land Foundation, which we had been discussing earlier and the  
**[0:18:16-0:18:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:18:16):**  work of Vilham Fawurta, he's been, Vilham's been talking about and whenever he has contact  
**[0:18:22-0:18:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:18:22):**  with potential investors and supporters, he says, I need you to stay engaged in this process  
**[0:18:28-0:18:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:18:28):**  for at least 20 years because ultimately that's the kind of timescale that you need capital  
**[0:18:36-0:18:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:18:36):**  or the people that hold or have access to the types of financial capital that enables  
**[0:18:43-0:18:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:18:43):**  the work.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:18:44):**  That's what we need.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:18:45):**  Those are the lengths of time or the time windows that we need people to stay engaged  
**[0:18:51-0:18:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:18:51):**  because that's really when you begin to see the recovery and the benefits that are produced  
**[0:18:57-0:18:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:18:57):**  from engaging in this kind of work.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:18:59):**  That's when you really start to see the benefits manifest.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:19:03):**  The problem is that that financial people are not known for their patience necessarily.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:19:08):**  No, and they're also always asking for track records, which of course, if the work takes,  
**[0:19:13-0:19:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:19:13):**  let's say at least 15 years to really show itself and this movement of large-scale ecosystem  
**[0:19:20-0:19:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:19:20):**  restoration isn't that old and there are not so many examples where you can show that because  
**[0:19:26-0:19:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:19:26):**  a lot of projects started maybe five years ago or if we're lucky eight.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:19:30):**  We still need to wait quite a bit before we can show you.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:19:33):**  Let's see, there's almost a portfolio of examples, but most of them are still very underdeveloped  
**[0:19:39-0:19:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:19:39):**  yet, but they're on the way.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:19:41):**  You cannot see too much.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:19:42):**  No, exactly.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:19:43):**  The funny thing is in some cases, it's not even necessarily a matter of even the work  
**[0:19:51-0:19:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:19:51):**  that is being called for taking 20 years necessarily.  
**[0:19:55-0:20:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:19:55):**  If you look at one of the better large-scale examples, which would of course be the Los  
**[0:20:02-0:20:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:20:02):**  Cueto Watershed Rehabilitation Project that John Liu has done a lot of media work on,  
**[0:20:08-0:20:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:20:08):**  that's a project that it's seen great results.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:20:12):**  Rehabilitating returns within a decade, but I think the key to the success of that project  
**[0:20:19-0:20:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:20:19):**  was number one, having a sizable amount of capital be made available at the beginning  
**[0:20:25-0:20:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:20:25):**  of the project and of course, there were certain aspects of the governance and the management  
**[0:20:31-0:20:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:20:31):**  of the area that was being worked on that facilitated its ability to produce the results  
**[0:20:40-0:20:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:20:40):**  that we saw.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:20:41):**  But if you break down the amount of investment per unit area in the Los Cueto Project, it's  
**[0:20:48-0:20:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:20:48):**  embarrassingly small.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:20:50):**  If you look at that project, it covered roughly 3.5 million hectares.  
**[0:20:57-0:21:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:20:57):**  The amount of money that was put up by the World Bank Rural Development Agency was half  
**[0:21:03-0:21:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:21:03):**  a billion dollars, it was $500 million over the course of 10 years.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:21:08):**  If you break down $500 million over 3.5 million hectares, that's roughly $143 per hectare  
**[0:21:18-0:21:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:21:18):**  over 10 years.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:21:20):**  So that means per year, it's roughly $14.30 a hectare for 10 years.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:21:28):**  And for that money, they were able to take 2.5 million people out of poverty in the four  
**[0:21:34-0:21:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:21:34):**  poorest regions of China.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:21:37):**  They were able to cut the rate of poverty from about 59% to 27%.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:21:42):**  And they tripled the incomes of the farmers in that area.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:21:46):**  And in the process of doing that, they were able to remedy all of the problems they had  
**[0:21:49-0:21:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:21:49):**  with famine, drought, flood, dust storms, the silting of the Yellow River and a number  
**[0:21:58-0:22:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:21:58):**  of the other kind of waterways in the region.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:22:00):**  But they brought back this entire, the ecological health of this entire region and revitalized  
**[0:22:06-0:22:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:22:06):**  the economy at the same time.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:22:08):**  So what that tells you is that they were able to identify kind of the acupressure points,  
**[0:22:16-0:22:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:22:16):**  which revived that entire terrestrial body, not only in terms of the ecosystem health,  
**[0:22:23-0:22:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:22:23):**  the ecosystem function, but also the economic health and the economic function and all the  
**[0:22:28-0:22:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:22:28):**  other things that are connected to that.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:22:29):**  So these things are not operating in a mutually exclusive manner.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:22:34):**  They're very much linked.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:22:36):**  They're very much connected, but you have to identify the right pressure points so you  
**[0:22:41-0:22:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:22:41):**  get that optimization or that maximizing of benefit by investing in the right place.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:22:47):**  And if that one has been such a success and it's been financed by partly by the World  
**[0:22:52-0:22:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:22:52):**  Bank, why haven't we seen more?  
**[0:22:54-0:22:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:22:54):**  Because it's been a few years.  
**[0:22:55-0:22:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:22:55):**  Well, that's a good question.  
**[0:22:57-0:23:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:22:57):**  I mean, I think part of it is, I think part of it is ignorance.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:23:02):**  And I think a lot, I think there are many people outside of a relatively small group  
**[0:23:07-0:23:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:23:07):**  of folks that, you know, operating in certain, you know, certain areas of activity that even  
**[0:23:15-0:23:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:23:15):**  know that a project like this even exists.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:23:19):**  And I know when I talk to people, I mean, especially, you know, anybody that's involved  
**[0:23:24-0:23:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:23:24):**  in finance or investment, they don't know anything about, you know, about this project.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:23:28):**  And a question should be, how can I invest in that?  
**[0:23:31-0:23:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:23:31):**  How can I put money to work?  
**[0:23:32-0:23:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:23:32):**  Because this was a World Bank grant, right?  
**[0:23:35-0:23:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:23:35):**  It wasn't an investment.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:23:36):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:23:37):**  I mean, the funny thing is if you take that project and you, you know, you use the same  
**[0:23:45-0:23:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:23:45):**  figures in terms of the amount of investment per unit area and you were to scale that up  
**[0:23:51-0:24:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:23:51):**  to the amount of land that is characterized as being either degraded, desertifying or  
**[0:24:00-0:24:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:24:00):**  desertified, which is approximately 2 billion hectares globally, and that number is growing  
**[0:24:07-0:24:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:24:07):**  according to the UNCCD, it's growing at a rate of about 10 to 12 million hectares per  
**[0:24:14-0:24:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:24:14):**  year.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:24:17):**  If you take that same figure, the investment numbers from the Los Plateo and you were to  
**[0:24:21-0:24:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:24:21):**  apply it to that area of degraded land, you could recover, theoretically, you could recover  
**[0:24:29-0:24:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:24:29):**  all of that land for a fraction of the annual defense budget for the United States.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:24:35):**  Which would probably also save a lot on the defense budget.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:24:38):**  Right, which would ultimately save a lot on the defense budget, which admittedly, you  
**[0:24:44-0:24:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:24:44):**  know, the US Department of Defense...  
**[0:24:46-0:24:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:24:46):**  Is quite well advanced in thinking on this part.  
**[0:24:48-0:24:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:24:48):**  Yeah, I mean, even the, you know, the US Department of Defense and other, you know, military and  
**[0:24:54-0:25:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:24:54):**  intelligence agencies have admitted that environmental issues are among the most important, if not  
**[0:25:04-0:25:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:25:04):**  the most important national security issues to be faced at present.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:25:09):**  So it's not like this isn't on the radar of the folks who see this as being, you know,  
**[0:25:18-0:25:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:25:18):**  a type of enlightened self-interest and understanding that, you know, this is going to impact not  
**[0:25:24-0:25:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:25:24):**  only the people that are, you know, would be characterized as being sort of tree huggers  
**[0:25:28-0:25:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:25:28):**  or, you know, environmentally minded, but just sort of the nuts and bolts, basic, you  
**[0:25:34-0:25:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:25:34):**  know, security minded people see this as being of prime critical importance and worthy of  
**[0:25:43-0:25:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:25:43):**  attention.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:25:44):**  And they should.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:25:45):**  Yeah.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:25:46):**  So let's recap.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:25:47):**  I'm an impact investor.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:25:48):**  I'm listening to this.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:25:49):**  I don't have $500 million in my back pocket, but I do have money to invest and I'm in the  
**[0:25:54-0:25:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:25:54):**  mindset of looking long term.  
**[0:25:57-0:25:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:25:57):**  I'm not scared anymore for the 20 years.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:25:59):**  And also the 20 years doesn't mean just to be clarified that your investment is locked  
**[0:26:05-0:26:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:26:05):**  up for 20 years.  
**[0:26:06-0:26:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:26:06):**  I mean, many of these ecosystem restoration projects have multiple different types of  
**[0:26:12-0:26:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:26:12):**  investments, different types of returns, different types of cycles, et cetera, but it takes about  
**[0:26:16-0:26:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:26:16):**  20 years to restore an ecosystem normally.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:26:18):**  So I'm used to that thinking.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:26:21):**  Where do I start and what do I set as goals as an investor that wants to put his or her  
**[0:26:25-0:26:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:26:25):**  own personal wealth to work?  
**[0:26:27-0:26:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:26:27):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:26:28):**  Well, I mean, I think that there are a number of publications that in recent years that  
**[0:26:35-0:26:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:26:35):**  I think do a pretty good job of identifying ways in which investment dollars can be mobilized  
**[0:26:43-0:26:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:26:43):**  or can be placed to be able to put investors in a position to realize a healthy return  
**[0:26:49-0:26:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:26:49):**  while producing a lot of good.  
**[0:26:51-0:27:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:26:51):**  I mean, one of the more valuable publications or references was actually put out by the  
**[0:27:01-0:27:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:27:01):**  United Nations Environment Program.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:27:05):**  The UNEP put together something called Dead Planet, Living Planet, Biodiversity and Ecosystem  
**[0:27:10-0:27:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:27:10):**  Restoration for Sustainable Development, a rapid response assessment.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:27:16):**  What they did was they tried to assess, number one, the financial impact that paying attention  
**[0:27:28-0:27:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:27:28):**  to the loss of ecosystem services, the impact it has on the economy.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:27:33):**  So for one...  
**[0:27:35-0:27:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:27:35):**  Is that where the famous number of 40 billion comes from?  
**[0:27:38-0:27:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:27:38):**  No, what was it?  
**[0:27:39-0:27:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:27:39):**  40 trillion?  
**[0:27:40-0:27:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:27:40):**  Yeah.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:27:41):**  So basically, just reading a portion of the introduction of that document says, biodiversity  
**[0:27:46-0:27:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:27:46):**  and ecosystems deliver crucial services to humankind, from food security to keeping our  
**[0:27:51-0:27:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:27:51):**  waters clean, buffering against extreme weather, providing medicines to recreation, and adding  
**[0:27:56-0:27:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:27:56):**  to the foundation of human culture.  
**[0:27:58-0:28:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:27:58):**  Together, these services have been estimated to be worth over 21 to 72 trillion US dollars  
**[0:28:05-0:28:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:28:05):**  every year, comparable to the world gross national income of 58 trillion US dollars  
**[0:28:10-0:28:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:28:10):**  in 2008.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:28:12):**  So in attempting to provide some sort of valuation of what is lost when we don't pay attention  
**[0:28:25-0:28:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:28:25):**  to these issues, providing this estimate was obviously supposed to be a way of attracting  
**[0:28:35-0:28:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:28:35):**  people's attention, or drawing their attention to this issue, and then using a financial  
**[0:28:43-0:28:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:28:43):**  incentive to get investors to put more money into this particular area of activity, of  
**[0:28:52-0:28:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:28:52):**  recovering ecological systems, recovering degraded landscapes, restoring areas that  
**[0:28:59-0:29:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:28:59):**  have become heavily degraded.  
**[0:29:02-0:29:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:29:02):**  The economics of the TEEB report that had been published in, I guess it was 2009, a  
**[0:29:08-0:29:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:29:08):**  great deal of what was contained in those documents, that's what ended up in this publication,  
**[0:29:13-0:29:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:29:13):**  this UNEP publication.  
**[0:29:15-0:29:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:29:15):**  So they did a lot of, I think, really great work in trying to estimate the value of, for  
**[0:29:21-0:29:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:29:21):**  example, farmland that is managed in a way that would be considered acceptable for the  
**[0:29:31-0:29:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:29:31):**  sale of organic produce as opposed to conventional.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:29:35):**  The fact that you're able to get a much higher market price, for instance, the ecological  
**[0:29:40-0:29:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:29:40):**  benefits of adopting agroecology.  
**[0:29:44-0:29:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:29:44):**  So there's that report that had come out from Olivier de Schutter, the UN Special Representative  
**[0:29:52-0:29:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:29:52):**  on the Right to Food.  
**[0:29:56-0:30:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:29:56):**  All of the benefits, I think, have been very well documented.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:30:00):**  So I think those are not in question.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:30:04):**  I think the problem is we haven't done a very good job of communicating that to people who  
**[0:30:12-0:30:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:30:12):**  are not familiar with these things.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:30:16):**  So I think there's a certain kind of cognitive mapping that finance people and investment  
**[0:30:25-0:30:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:30:25):**  people are familiar with and they're accustomed to looking at the world via that mapping.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:30:32):**  That lens, yeah.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:30:33):**  Right, through that lens.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:30:35):**  And they're not quite able to get their head around what's being discussed here.  
**[0:30:43-0:30:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:30:43):**  So I don't think it's necessarily a matter of the information isn't available.  
**[0:30:47-0:30:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:30:47):**  The information is available.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:30:49):**  It's just that these are people that are not accustomed to looking in the places in which  
**[0:30:55-0:30:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:30:55):**  this information is available.  
**[0:30:58-0:31:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:30:58):**  And so how do we bridge the gap?  
**[0:31:01-0:31:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:31:01):**  How do we do a better job of marketing and of communicating this opportunity to people  
**[0:31:10-0:31:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:31:10):**  who may very well be interested in it if they knew that it was available?  
**[0:31:16-0:31:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:31:16):**  And if they understood the mechanisms by which they can put their money in and then eventually  
**[0:31:21-0:31:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:31:21):**  be able to see the returns come back.  
**[0:31:25-0:31:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:31:25):**  And again, very healthy long-term returns.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:31:29):**  And do you see a lot of those mechanisms?  
**[0:31:31-0:31:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:31:31):**  Because that would be probably the next question of an investor who has read all of these documents  
**[0:31:36-0:31:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:31:36):**  has seen, sees of course in his personal or her personal surrounding the effects of non-sustainable  
**[0:31:44-0:31:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:31:44):**  land management.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:31:45):**  And then the question, okay, what's next?  
**[0:31:47-0:31:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:31:47):**  How can I, what's my call to action?  
**[0:31:49-0:31:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:31:49):**  How can I get busy and start investing?  
**[0:31:53-0:31:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:31:53):**  And then you need vehicles or you buy a lot of land yourself and start developing that  
**[0:31:57-0:31:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:31:57):**  as sustainably as possible.  
**[0:31:59-0:32:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:31:59):**  But you probably usually run out of funds pretty quickly.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:32:03):**  How can you sort of indirectly put money to work in the sector?  
**[0:32:07-0:32:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:32:07):**  Well, again, I think the problem, and again, as we were discussing before we started recording  
**[0:32:14-0:32:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:32:14):**  was I think the investor's mindset, number one, has to change from one that is essentially  
**[0:32:28-0:32:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:32:28):**  a gambler's mindset or a speculators mindset.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:32:32):**  Which is not even an investor.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:32:34):**  We call it before, like it's a gambler instead of an investor.  
**[0:32:38-0:32:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:32:38):**  Can you distinguish the two?  
**[0:32:39-0:32:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:32:39):**  Right.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:32:40):**  Yeah.  
**[0:32:41-0:32:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:32:41):**  An investor is someone who I think is in reality and in actuality, they are looking to produce  
**[0:32:52-0:32:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:32:52):**  more benefit than simply being able to make a lot of money by finding a way to make the  
**[0:32:59-0:33:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:32:59):**  quick buck.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:33:00):**  They're actually looking for opportunities that produce more benefit than simply making  
**[0:33:09-0:33:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:33:09):**  fast money.  
**[0:33:10-0:33:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:33:10):**  I mean, if it's just a matter of making fast money, I mean, really, this drive to make  
**[0:33:14-0:33:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:33:14):**  fast money, it doesn't distinguish investment people from thieves.  
**[0:33:20-0:33:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:33:20):**  Thieves can make fast money by picking people's pockets.  
**[0:33:23-0:33:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:33:23):**  Drug dealers can make fast money by selling a narcotic to an addict.  
**[0:33:32-0:33:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:33:32):**  Bank robbers can make fast money by sticking up a bank.  
**[0:33:34-0:33:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:33:34):**  But nobody would call them investors.  
**[0:33:36-0:33:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:33:36):**  Right.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:33:37):**  But that's not what investment is.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:33:39):**  That's just that's making that's hustling.  
**[0:33:44-0:33:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:33:44):**  That's what that is.  
**[0:33:45-0:33:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:33:45):**  I think what investors do is they are able to take capital and they understand that there  
**[0:33:53-0:34:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:33:53):**  are many more types of capital other than that found in finance.  
**[0:34:03-0:34:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:34:03):**  So we had talked before about the work of some colleagues of mine, Ethan Roland and  
**[0:34:08-0:34:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:34:08):**  Gregory Landler, who have written this book on regenerative enterprise.  
**[0:34:14-0:34:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:34:14):**  And in the course of writing the book and presenting the ideas of the book, they talk  
**[0:34:17-0:34:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:34:17):**  about there being eight forms of capital.  
**[0:34:21-0:34:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:34:21):**  Among them, there's intellectual capital, there's cultural capital, there's financial  
**[0:34:27-0:34:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:34:27):**  capital, natural capital, living capital, spiritual capital, social capital.  
**[0:34:34-0:34:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:34:34):**  Again, there's all of these other forms of capital which forms the basis of our lives.  
**[0:34:43-0:34:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:34:43):**  And ultimately, I think what an investor is trying to do is take whatever capital they  
**[0:34:47-0:34:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:34:47):**  have in place or they have access to and they are looking to produce as much benefit as  
**[0:34:55-0:34:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:34:55):**  possible not only for themselves.  
**[0:34:57-0:34:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:34:57):**  Right.  
**[0:34:58-0:35:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:34:58):**  They are able to create this extended concatenation, if you will, of beneficial outcomes from identifying  
**[0:35:10-0:35:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:35:10):**  ways in which to employ finance, for instance.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:35:15):**  And then they are able to create this long-term extended benefit for circles outside of their  
**[0:35:23-0:35:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:35:23):**  immediate sphere of influence or operation.  
**[0:35:27-0:35:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:35:27):**  They are able to see how they can contribute to the creation of this creation of some sort  
**[0:35:33-0:35:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:35:33):**  of great civilizational outcome through the employment of their capital.  
**[0:35:40-0:35:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:35:40):**  And I think enabling people to be able to live a dignified existence, that's what I  
**[0:35:47-0:35:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:35:47):**  see an investor as being, as someone who produces that outcome.  
**[0:35:52-0:35:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:35:52):**  They are able to create more benefit than harm through their employment of their management  
**[0:35:56-0:35:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:35:56):**  of capital.  
**[0:35:58-0:36:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:35:58):**  And that's for me, that's what an investor is, is someone who does that.  
**[0:36:03-0:36:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:36:03):**  Anything aside from that, that's just solely interested in making a lot of money through  
**[0:36:10-0:36:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:36:10):**  admittedly employing some sort of skill and I think a great deal of it is luck and being  
**[0:36:18-0:36:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:36:18):**  able to flip $1 and make it into $5 somehow.  
**[0:36:22-0:36:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:36:22):**  I mean, that's artifice.  
**[0:36:25-0:36:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:36:25):**  You can extract money or you can extract some sort of selfish benefit out of a broken system.  
**[0:36:33-0:36:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:36:33):**  And essentially, that's what we see happening is people are very good at doing that.  
**[0:36:37-0:36:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:36:37):**  But ultimately, you're going to have to face not addressing some of those critical items  
**[0:36:43-0:36:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:36:43):**  that we now see confronting us in the world today.  
**[0:36:48-0:36:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:36:48):**  And that this idea that I'm safe if you're safe, I'm taken care of if you're taken care  
**[0:36:56-0:37:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:36:56):**  of, I'm in danger if you're in danger, unless that sensibility is adopted by people that  
**[0:37:03-0:37:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:37:03):**  are in the realm of investment, in the world of investment, unless that's a reality for  
**[0:37:11-0:37:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:37:11):**  people, then I think we're in for a very difficult time for the foreseeable future.  
**[0:37:16-0:37:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:37:16):**  Yeah, definitely.  
**[0:37:17-0:37:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:37:17):**  And to switch gears a bit, we've mentioned them before, but I don't think we've put enough  
**[0:37:23-0:37:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:37:23):**  attention to them, to the camps.  
**[0:37:26-0:37:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:37:26):**  So what are the ecosystem restoration camps?  
**[0:37:28-0:37:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:37:28):**  It's relatively new.  
**[0:37:29-0:37:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:37:29):**  There's one getting up in Spain, but can you explain a bit more on that?  
**[0:37:33-0:37:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:37:33):**  Well, I think the ecosystem restoration camps, interestingly enough, I believe is a product  
**[0:37:40-0:37:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:37:40):**  of an attempt to try to bring what we were just discussing to the fore.  
**[0:37:47-0:37:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:37:47):**  This idea of being able to take land, land that's degraded, land that is in particularly  
**[0:37:53-0:38:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:37:53):**  good shape, and employing certain strategies and techniques that are replicable.  
**[0:38:05-0:38:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:38:05):**  You're showing how you can use these ideas and these approaches to bring back damaged  
**[0:38:10-0:38:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:38:10):**  landscape and then training people in how to use them.  
**[0:38:14-0:38:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:38:14):**  And then going somewhere else in the world where you have a very similar condition, and  
**[0:38:21-0:38:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:38:21):**  you repeat what you were able to do at the camp.  
**[0:38:25-0:38:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:38:25):**  And so the first example that we have, the first camp is on a farm of a family that was  
**[0:38:34-0:38:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:38:34):**  interested in participating in the project.  
**[0:38:39-0:38:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:38:39):**  It's a farm that's in southern Spain, on the Altiplano, and a lot of southern Spain is  
**[0:38:45-0:38:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:38:45):**  in pretty bad shape in terms of land degradation.  
**[0:38:51-0:38:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:38:51):**  A lot of southern Spain is like North Africa.  
**[0:38:54-0:39:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:38:54):**  And because it was seen that there's a need for this kind of work to be done, these were  
**[0:39:01-0:39:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:39:01):**  folks that were willing to give us a base from which to work, to be able to demonstrate  
**[0:39:07-0:39:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:39:07):**  the idea, have it be documented, give people a place to be able to come and participate  
**[0:39:14-0:39:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:39:14):**  in this, and then eventually be able to deploy this in various regions of the globe that  
**[0:39:19-0:39:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:39:19):**  are in need of the same work.  
**[0:39:21-0:39:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:39:21):**  And I think by means of this, we're able to show not only how we can produce a great outcome  
**[0:39:30-0:39:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:39:30):**  from bringing back landscape and restoring its ecological function, but also seeing how  
**[0:39:35-0:39:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:39:35):**  economically this is something that can produce a great deal of benefit, not only in terms  
**[0:39:40-0:39:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:39:40):**  of the productive capabilities of landscape, but how it can employ a huge number of people  
**[0:39:49-0:39:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:39:49):**  potentially and give them meaningful work to do and provide a really robust economic  
**[0:39:58-0:40:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:39:58):**  engine that can be transferred to anywhere and everywhere.  
**[0:40:06-0:40:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:40:06):**  And the first one is up in Spain, I think since a few months.  
**[0:40:09-0:40:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:40:09):**  I mean, it's very new.  
**[0:40:10-0:40:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:40:10):**  I saw a lot of things on Twitter.  
**[0:40:12-0:40:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:40:12):**  Where the next plant or that depends on the people that come and then take it back home  
**[0:40:17-0:40:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:40:17):**  basically or taking to the landscapes that they're working or wanted to work in?  
**[0:40:21-0:40:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:40:21):**  Yeah, so if you look at, you know, one of the main participants or one of the main supporters  
**[0:40:26-0:40:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:40:26):**  of the project is Common Land Foundation.  
**[0:40:29-0:40:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:40:29):**  And so they're currently behind this effort to an extent, but they also have sort of similar  
**[0:40:36-0:40:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:40:36):**  work that's operating in a very similar vein in South Africa, in Western Australia, and  
**[0:40:45-0:40:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:40:45):**  also another area in southern Spain.  
**[0:40:48-0:40:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:40:48):**  And so, you know, we can, and these and those efforts are actually specifically oriented  
**[0:40:56-0:41:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:40:56):**  towards agricultural businesses, you know, that are looking to use more regenerative  
**[0:41:02-0:41:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:41:02):**  methods to, you know, to do what they've been doing.  
**[0:41:07-0:41:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:41:07):**  But obviously the regenerative methods are meant to be able to produce more benefit because  
**[0:41:12-0:41:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:41:12):**  they're using techniques and strategies that are much more amenable to being on landscape  
**[0:41:18-0:41:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:41:18):**  for an extended period of time.  
**[0:41:20-0:41:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:41:20):**  It's able to produce a more multifaceted benefit, not only in terms of, you know, economically  
**[0:41:25-0:41:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:41:25):**  speaking for the folks that are on land, but also, you know, you're able to see how in  
**[0:41:31-0:41:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:41:31):**  terms of the ecosystem function, the ecological functioning of that landscape, it's producing  
**[0:41:35-0:41:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:41:35):**  benefit as well.  
**[0:41:37-0:41:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:41:37):**  So you know, the camps right now, the first one is in Spain, although we have talked about  
**[0:41:43-0:41:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:41:43):**  the possibility of extending this.  
**[0:41:46-0:41:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:41:46):**  For instance, I have a colleague in Tasmania who I had suggested using his place as a site  
**[0:41:55-0:41:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:41:55):**  to be able to establish a camp because a great deal of what it is that we want to get set  
**[0:41:58-0:42:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:41:58):**  up in Spain, he already has going at his site.  
**[0:42:05-0:42:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:42:05):**  It's a colleague named Paul Ringo Keene, and he has a business called Tiger Hill Permaculture  
**[0:42:10-0:42:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:42:10):**  in Tasmania.  
**[0:42:11-0:42:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:42:11):**  And I would invite everybody to look up what he's been doing.  
**[0:42:18-0:42:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:42:18):**  But I think there are a number of other potential sites that could also serve as, you know,  
**[0:42:25-0:42:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:42:25):**  in a similar way as to what we have happening in southern Spain.  
**[0:42:28-0:42:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:42:28):**  It's just a matter of getting everybody sort of networked, being able to get the word out  
**[0:42:34-0:42:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:42:34):**  to people that are interested in becoming involved, to get the word out to people that  
**[0:42:39-0:42:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:42:39):**  may be interested in financially backing what it is that we're doing.  
**[0:42:43-0:42:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:42:43):**  Because right now, you know, this is largely financed through the contributions of the  
**[0:42:52-0:42:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:42:52):**  donations that are being put in by people that are becoming members of the project.  
**[0:42:56-0:43:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:42:56):**  So we're asking for 10 euros a month, about 120 euros a year to become a formal member  
**[0:43:02-0:43:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:43:02):**  of the ecosystem restoration camps.  
**[0:43:06-0:43:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:43:06):**  And this is, you know, largely what is financing the, you know, the present functioning of  
**[0:43:12-0:43:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:43:12):**  those camps, the provisioning of those camps.  
**[0:43:14-0:43:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:43:14):**  Extremely, extremely interesting.  
**[0:43:16-0:43:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:43:16):**  I want to end with a final question to you.  
**[0:43:21-0:43:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:43:21):**  What's next for you?  
**[0:43:22-0:43:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:43:22):**  What's next for the...  
**[0:43:23-0:43:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:43:23):**  I mean, you're traveling a lot through or for permaculture and regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:43:28-0:43:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:43:28):**  From now on, basically, let's say until the end of the year, what are you most excited  
**[0:43:31-0:43:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:43:31):**  about?  
**[0:43:32-0:43:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:43:32):**  What do you want to share?  
**[0:43:33-0:43:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:43:33):**  What can you share about what's coming up for you?  
**[0:43:36-0:43:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:43:36):**  Well, again, a lot of my work is centered on, you know, mostly the sort of the dry lands,  
**[0:43:46-0:43:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:43:46):**  the arid climate regions of the globe, so Middle East, North Africa, the Gulf, Southern  
**[0:43:53-0:43:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:43:53):**  Europe.  
**[0:43:54-0:44:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:43:54):**  And so I have a number of projects, you know, some of them are design courses and some of  
**[0:44:00-0:44:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:44:00):**  them are, again, are, you know, setting up similar types of project work that we see  
**[0:44:06-0:44:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:44:06):**  happening in Spain.  
**[0:44:08-0:44:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:44:08):**  Some of them are consultancies.  
**[0:44:10-0:44:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:44:10):**  So I'm continuing to do what I've been doing, you know, elsewhere in the region over the  
**[0:44:18-0:44:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:44:18):**  past several years.  
**[0:44:20-0:44:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:44:20):**  But I think, you know, ultimately, you know, the goal is always to try getting some variety  
**[0:44:31-0:44:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:44:31):**  of large-scale, long-term restoration work, you know, to be established.  
**[0:44:37-0:44:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:44:37):**  And again, get the proper backing, the proper financial backing and resourcing of those  
**[0:44:43-0:44:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:44:43):**  projects so that we have bigger and better examples to bring to the table.  
**[0:44:50-0:44:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:44:50):**  And you know, success breeds success, which is what I like to always say.  
**[0:44:54-0:45:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:44:54):**  And I think it's just a matter of having, you know, bigger and better, well-documented  
**[0:45:02-0:45:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:45:02):**  examples of the work to show to people so that, you know, they have the assurance that  
**[0:45:07-0:45:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:45:07):**  fine, if they're being asked to get behind this work, that, you know, it's something  
**[0:45:14-0:45:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:45:14):**  that is going to net them a return.  
**[0:45:16-0:45:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:45:16):**  They actually see that this is turning into something that's worth getting behind.  
**[0:45:22-0:45:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:45:22):**  And you know, a lot of what I'm doing is just simply trying to contribute whatever I can  
**[0:45:28-0:45:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:45:28):**  to that end, is to, you know, bring more attention to what it is that, you know, we're hoping  
**[0:45:33-0:45:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:45:33):**  to bring to the mainstream, if you will, mainstream consciousness, is understanding that this  
**[0:45:39-0:45:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:45:39):**  is a possibility for us, that we can bring back these degraded areas of the globe.  
**[0:45:46-0:45:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:45:46):**  And ultimately, that is what is going to provide the type of stability and security I think  
**[0:45:52-0:45:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:45:52):**  many of us are concerned about, you know, we're concerned about establishing.  
**[0:45:58-0:46:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:45:58):**  To bring back hope, if I can summarize it.  
**[0:46:01-0:46:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:46:01):**  Yeah, I mean, really, that's ultimately, I think, the goal is that, you know, it is possible  
**[0:46:08-0:46:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:46:08):**  for all of us to live in a world where we can live a dignified existence.  
**[0:46:13-0:46:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:46:13):**  And it doesn't have, you know, we don't have to be in a place to where, you know, you have  
**[0:46:18-0:46:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:46:18):**  a very small number of people that are living high on the hog, if you will, and everybody  
**[0:46:22-0:46:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:46:22):**  else is, you know, living this, you know, this decrepit, dystopian, depressing life,  
**[0:46:32-0:46:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:46:32):**  you know, at the expense of, you know, the small number of people that are just, you  
**[0:46:37-0:46:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:46:37):**  know, taking more than they really need.  
**[0:46:40-0:46:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:46:40):**  And it doesn't have to be that way.  
**[0:46:43-0:46:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:46:43):**  And I think if you really have a concern, not only for people, but just, you know, if  
**[0:46:48-0:46:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:46:48):**  you have a concern for the, you know, the world that you live in, you know, and you  
**[0:46:53-0:47:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:46:53):**  want to think about more than simply yourself, this is something that I believe is a very  
**[0:47:00-0:47:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:47:00):**  real possibility in terms of providing that potential to create that world to where everybody  
**[0:47:09-0:47:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:47:09):**  has enough, have more than enough.  
**[0:47:11-0:47:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:47:11):**  And, you know, we all can live a good life.  
**[0:47:15-0:47:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:47:15):**  With that, I would like to thank you and end this interview, I'm sure we'll be checking

**[0:47:35-0:47:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:47:35):**  and a gambler, the short time mindset of most investors, and his involvement in ecosystem  
**[0:47:40-0:47:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:47:40):**  restoration camps, which just started in Spain this year.

**[0:48:42-0:48:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:48:42):**  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[0:48:46-0:48:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:48:46):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  
**[0:48:50-0:48:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:48:50):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[0:48:51-0:48:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:48:51):**  After a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of audio asking the question  
**[0:48:55-0:49:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:48:55):**  how to put money to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011  
**[0:49:00-0:49:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:49:00):**  and recording these podcasts since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  
**[0:49:05-0:49:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:49:05):**  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  
**[0:49:08-0:49:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:49:08):**  How have we built our decision-making framework, what to focus on with the podcast, how have  
**[0:49:13-0:49:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:49:13):**  we picked interviewees and what questions should you ask, what is happening in the space,  
**[0:49:18-0:49:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:49:18):**  what should you read, what should you listen, what should you watch, how to approach this  
**[0:49:23-0:49:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:49:23):**  space.

**[0:50:00-0:50:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:50:00):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:50:02-0:50:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:50:02):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you and I'm very aware  
**[0:50:07-0:50:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:50:07):**  that among the listeners of this podcast we have people with very different means.  
**[0:50:12-0:50:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:50:12):**  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[0:50:17-0:50:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:50:17):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[0:50:20-0:50:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:50:20):**  Thank you.  
**[0:50:21-0:50:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:50:21):**  So what is this course?  
**[0:50:22-0:50:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:50:22):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  
**[0:50:28-0:50:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:50:28):**  so you don't have to write along.  
**[0:50:30-0:50:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:50:30):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:50:35-0:50:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:50:35):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:50:41-0:50:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:50:41):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[0:50:45-0:50:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:50:45):**  if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:50:47-0:50:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:50:47):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:50:52-0:50:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:50:52):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:50:56-0:51:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:50:56):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:51:01-0:51:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:51:01):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:51:02-0:51:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:51:02):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:51:04-0:51:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:51:04):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:51:06-0:51:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:51:06):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:51:10-0:51:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:51:10):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:51:12-0:51:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:51:12):**  Before making any investment please find professional investment advice.  
**[0:51:17-0:51:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/08/21/rhamis-kent/#t=0:51:17):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking.

## 140 Satish Kumar – Be humble, you can’t outsmart nature  
**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  
**[0:00:05-0:00:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:00:05):**  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com or in the links below.  
**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:00:14):**  Today a different conversation.  
**[0:00:16-0:00:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:00:16):**  We have an 85 year old author and philosopher and probably the most importantly a gardener  
**[0:00:21-0:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:00:21):**  about the role and your role and our role in nature and what can investors do and how  
**[0:00:26-0:00:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:00:26):**  to be humble and so much more.  
**[0:00:28-0:00:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:00:28):**  Be ready for the energy coming out of your speakers because Satish might be 85 but has  
**[0:00:32-0:00:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:00:32):**  more energy than most people I know.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:00:36):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture, Investing as if  
**[0:00:41-0:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:00:41):**  the Planet Mattered.  
**[0:00:42-0:00:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:00:42):**  A podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:46-0:00:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:00:46):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:00:52-0:00:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:00:52):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:56-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:00:56):**  Why my focus on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:58-0:01:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:00:58):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:02-0:01:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:01:02):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat and it's time that we as investors, big and small  
**[0:01:07-0:01:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:01:07):**  and consumers, start paying much more attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:01:14):**  In March last year we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support  
**[0:01:18-0:01:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:01:18):**  our work and so many of you have joined as a member.  
**[0:01:21-0:01:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:01:21):**  We've launched different types of benefits, exclusive content, Q&A webinars with former  
**[0:01:25-0:01:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:01:25):**  guests, ask me anything sessions plus so much more to come in the future.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:01:29):**  For more information on the different tiers, benefits and how to become a member check

**[0:01:38-0:01:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:01:38):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:01:39):**  So today a very special episode with the founder and director of programs at the Schumacher  
**[0:01:44-0:01:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:01:44):**  College, an international center for ecology studies and the editor emeritus of resurgence  
**[0:01:49-0:01:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:01:49):**  and ecologists.  
**[0:01:50-0:01:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:01:50):**  And mind you he did a peace walk a few years ago of 8,000 miles which is a bit more than  
**[0:01:55-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:01:55):**  the 10,000 steps that we all try to do per day and very importantly wrote a very interesting  
**[0:02:00-0:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:02:00):**  book on soil, soul and society.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:02:03):**  Welcome Satish.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:02:04):**  My pleasure to be your guest.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:02:07):**  And to start with a personal question, I have a thousand questions probably, but why are  
**[0:02:11-0:02:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:02:11):**  you focusing quite a bit of your attention, your writing and of course also your daily  
**[0:02:16-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:02:16):**  work on the soil, the food and the agriculture space?  
**[0:02:20-0:02:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:02:20):**  You know, in the world today we all talk about economic growth and economy, economy, economy,  
**[0:02:29-0:02:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:02:29):**  but they don't understand what economy means.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:02:33):**  They think economy means money.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:02:37):**  But economy is a very beautiful word and economy relates to ecosystem, ecology and soil is  
**[0:02:48-0:02:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:02:48):**  the source of ecology.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:02:51):**  Soil is life itself.  
**[0:02:54-0:02:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:02:54):**  Everything what we have comes from soil.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:02:57):**  Our body is made of soil.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:03:00):**  Our food we eat is soil transformed.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:03:04):**  The mangoes, the oranges, the apples, the grapes, the bread, the rice, everything what  
**[0:03:11-0:03:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:03:11):**  we eat is nothing but soil.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:03:13):**  Houses are made of soil.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:03:15):**  The wood is soil.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:03:17):**  The stones are soil.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:03:19):**  So soil is everything.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:03:21):**  At this moment, particularly soil is important because of climate change and the soil is  
**[0:03:27-0:03:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:03:27):**  the real bank of carbon.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:03:31):**  It can sequestrate and hold carbon.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:03:33):**  So at the moment I would like all politicians, business leaders, corporate leaders, economists,  
**[0:03:41-0:03:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:03:41):**  educationists, all to focus on soil.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:03:44):**  Soil is a source of life.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:03:46):**  And what would you tell them?  
**[0:03:49-0:03:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:03:49):**  Soil seems also sacred, but yet there are many people that are saying if we don't quantify  
**[0:03:55-0:03:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:03:55):**  ecosystem services like the carbon piece you just mentioned or the biodiversity and the  
**[0:03:59-0:04:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:03:59):**  water storage or infiltration, then we'll never get the investors interested.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:04:04):**  We'll never get the financial world, that is not the economy, but the financial world  
**[0:04:07-0:04:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:04:07):**  interested in it.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:04:08):**  I feel attention there.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:04:10):**  Do you feel that too?  
**[0:04:11-0:04:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:04:11):**  And what would you say to people that are working on these ecosystem services and getting  
**[0:04:15-0:04:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:04:15):**  them payable and thus maybe getting all the politicians, et cetera, interested in this  
**[0:04:21-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:04:21):**  dirt under our feet?  
**[0:04:23-0:04:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:04:23):**  Yes.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:04:24):**  Ecosystem services is a kind of metaphor.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:04:28):**  As long as you know that the measurement of nature can only be a kind of shorthand, in  
**[0:04:37-0:04:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:04:37):**  the long run you cannot measure the value of nature, value of soil.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:04:44):**  You cannot measure how much your breath is worth.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:04:49):**  You cannot value how much your water is worth.  
**[0:04:53-0:05:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:04:53):**  If you pay more for milk and less for water, it's not less valuable.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:05:00):**  Just because you pay less than milk doesn't mean that water is less valuable.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:05:04):**  You can live without milk, but you cannot live without water.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:05:08):**  Just because something is free, the sunshine is free, but doesn't mean the sunshine has  
**[0:05:13-0:05:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:05:13):**  no value, even though you cannot measure how much sunshine is valuable.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:05:19):**  But you pay to go to France or to Italy or to Greece or somewhere for holiday or Goa,  
**[0:05:26-0:05:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:05:26):**  but the sunshine is freely given.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:05:29):**  So in the end, we cannot put monetary value on nature.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:05:36):**  But in the meantime, as a metaphor, just to communicate, to understand how valuable the  
**[0:05:42-0:05:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:05:42):**  natural systems are for us in monetary terms, we can use ecosystem services and monetary  
**[0:05:49-0:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:05:49):**  value as a kind of shorthand on a very superficial level.  
**[0:05:54-0:06:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:05:54):**  But in the heart of heart, we have to understand that nature is beyond monetary value.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:06:01):**  So let's say it's a transition.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:06:03):**  We can use it now to get people hooked to the world of soil, the immense possibilities,  
**[0:06:11-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:06:11):**  and use it even though we cannot properly fully measure nature.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:06:15):**  We can use a proxy or we can actually kickstart the regeneration by using ecosystem services,  
**[0:06:20-0:06:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:06:20):**  even though we all know it's not perfect.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:06:22):**  Yes, our language is a kind of tool and we can use the language to understand something  
**[0:06:29-0:06:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:06:29):**  deeper which goes beyond language, beyond measurement.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:06:33):**  But our modern science and modern economy and modern technology somehow have to come  
**[0:06:39-0:06:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:06:39):**  to believe that what you cannot measure does not exist.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:06:45):**  Only what exists that you can measure.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:06:48):**  I think that is a bit too narrow a view.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:06:51):**  We have to say, yes, we can measure something.  
**[0:06:54-0:06:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:06:54):**  We can measure the length and breadth of something.  
**[0:06:57-0:07:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:06:57):**  But we cannot measure love.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:07:00):**  We cannot measure friendship.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:07:02):**  We cannot measure the value of a mother.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:07:06):**  How much the mother's breast milk.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:07:09):**  It may be very little for the baby, only 4% or 3% of protein in mother's milk.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:07:16):**  And yet without that milk, we will not exist.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:07:19):**  So we have to always understand that there are measured measurements and we can measure  
**[0:07:25-0:07:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:07:25):**  things and they are important.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:07:27):**  They are matter.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:07:28):**  But there's more than matter, more than measurement.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:07:31):**  That is value.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:07:33):**  The meaning, the meaning of what we are doing.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:07:36):**  You can measure the house is this long and this wide, but the meaning of the house is  
**[0:07:41-0:07:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:07:41):**  more how you live there.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:07:43):**  So measurement and meaning must come together.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:07:47):**  Measurement and meaning should be married rather than separated.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:07:51):**  At the moment, people have separated meaning from the measure and they only value measure  
**[0:07:56-0:07:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:07:56):**  and they don't value meaning.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:07:58):**  This is a problem of our time.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:08:00):**  You said language is important.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:08:02):**  I think we can all agree or many would agree ecosystem services is a horrible term.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:08:07):**  Do you have a better suggestion how to call these two more?  
**[0:08:11-0:08:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:08:11):**  Marry those two like we're measuring something.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:08:13):**  We know it's not perfect, but it gets us to a world of more meaning.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:08:17):**  Are there better terms that you know of that can capture a bit of the complexity and still  
**[0:08:21-0:08:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:08:21):**  something we can potentially measure?  
**[0:08:24-0:08:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:08:24):**  I think I'm not denying the importance of measurement for material things you can measure,  
**[0:08:30-0:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:08:30):**  but for that, there is a non material aspect of life and that you cannot measure.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:08:36):**  So meaningful measurement, meaningful measurement is my word.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:08:42):**  If you have a meaningful measurement, then ecosystem services can be a useful way to  
**[0:08:48-0:08:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:08:48):**  approach.  
**[0:08:49-0:08:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:08:49):**  And let's talk a bit about Schumacher College, which I've heard about a lot.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:08:53):**  I've never been.  
**[0:08:54-0:08:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:08:54):**  I know a few people that have attended.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:08:57):**  Can you share a bit more about that story of how it started because you were there absolutely  
**[0:09:01-0:09:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:09:01):**  at the beginning and where it like what it morphed into, what it evolved into now as  
**[0:09:07-0:09:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:09:07):**  we're talking end of October 2021.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:09:09):**  Schumacher College is a nature centered education.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:09:14):**  At Schumacher College, we say that education is not only to get a job.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:09:19):**  I hope so.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:09:20):**  To be successful in your life and have a big car or a big house or have a name, fame, prestige,  
**[0:09:30-0:09:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:09:30):**  power, status, control.  
**[0:09:32-0:09:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:09:32):**  These are the egocentric education.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:09:36):**  Schumacher College is an ecocentric education.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:09:38):**  We move from ego to eco.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:09:40):**  Eco is about relationship.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:09:42):**  We all exist in mutuality and reciprocity.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:09:45):**  So we educate our young people at Schumacher College so that they can go out in the world  
**[0:09:51-0:09:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:09:51):**  and live in harmony with nature, look after the soil, look after the trees and how we  
**[0:09:57-0:10:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:09:57):**  enhance our relationship on the basis of mutuality and reciprocity.  
**[0:10:03-0:10:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:10:03):**  And also at Schumacher College, we have education of head, education of heart and education  
**[0:10:08-0:10:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:10:08):**  of hands.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:10:09):**  So all our students touch the soil, all our students partake in the gardening.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:10:16):**  And Schumacher College is based at an estate called Dartington Hall.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:10:21):**  And this estate is 1000 acres.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:10:25):**  And at a part of Schumacher College, we have two programs.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:10:30):**  Program number one is training in the gardening.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:10:33):**  So we have about 20 students coming to Schumacher College for six months.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:10:39):**  They come in April and they stay there until September.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:10:42):**  And these six months, they learn about all agroecological principles, permaculture principles.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:10:49):**  So agroecology, permaculture, no-dig gardening, organic gardening, biodynamic gardening, all  
**[0:10:56-0:11:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:10:56):**  methods of sustainable and regenerative gardening so that we build the soil because soil is  
**[0:11:04-0:11:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:11:04):**  the bank for carbon.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:11:06):**  Soil is the home for the millions of microorganisms.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:11:11):**  Soil is a source of life.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:11:13):**  And so we teach our young people how to look after the soil and how to build soil so that  
**[0:11:19-0:11:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:11:19):**  we can have economy of nature for millions and millions of years to come.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:11:25):**  But in addition to that six months program of gardening, we have a master's program in  
**[0:11:31-0:11:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:11:31):**  food and farming in a regenerative way, regenerative food and farming.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:11:37):**  And that's a master's program because we, as I said, we have 1000 acres of land and  
**[0:11:42-0:11:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:11:42):**  we are looking for people to invest if they can and come with some funding as well.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:11:48):**  We need some funding.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:11:50):**  So we are going to use this 1000 acres to create an example of regenerative farming,  
**[0:11:56-0:12:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:11:56):**  regenerative food system, and training young people.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:12:00):**  Even we think that at the moment, agriculture is neglected.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:12:04):**  In our society, we value computers and cars and industry and business and cities and the  
**[0:12:12-0:12:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:12:12):**  farmers are kind of left behind.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:12:15):**  Only if you are uneducated, you are not smart, you are not clever, then you live in the village  
**[0:12:22-0:12:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:12:22):**  and you farm.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:12:23):**  And even the farmers don't want their children to go in farming, but farming has no money,  
**[0:12:28-0:12:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:12:28):**  no much capital.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:12:30):**  So everybody wants to go and work in a bank.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:12:32):**  If you are working in a bank, you get hundreds and thousands of euros or pounds or dollars  
**[0:12:38-0:12:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:12:38):**  paid to you.  
**[0:12:39-0:12:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:12:39):**  But if you are working on a farm, you are a farm laborer or farm worker or farmer, you  
**[0:12:43-0:12:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:12:43):**  get maybe 100 pounds or 200 pounds a day.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:12:46):**  So this is the kind of status of farming in our society is very, very low.  
**[0:12:52-0:12:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:12:52):**  At Schumacher College and at Dartington, we want to lift the status of farming.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:12:56):**  We want to say that farming is more important than banking.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:13:00):**  Farming is more important than creating computers.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:13:03):**  Farming is more important than politics.  
**[0:13:06-0:13:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:13:06):**  Farming is more important than industry.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:13:07):**  But without farming, there is no food.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:13:09):**  And without food, humans cannot exist.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:13:11):**  And in order to do good farming, we have to build good soil.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:13:15):**  Soil is a living soil.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:13:17):**  And we have to revere and respect the sacred living soil.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:13:21):**  So this is why at Schumacher College, we have these two programs to teach young people how  
**[0:13:26-0:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:13:26):**  to do regenerative gardening and how to do regenerative farming.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:13:32):**  And so I hope that your listeners can visit Schumacher College website and see what we  
**[0:13:37-0:13:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:13:37):**  are doing.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:13:38):**  And if they are interested, please get in touch with us and we can do some work together.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:13:43):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:13:44):**  I will put a link below.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:13:45):**  Yeah, we have land, but we are looking for some capital.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:13:48):**  I will put a link below and also if people are interested, obviously, to attend the courses  
**[0:13:53-0:13:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:13:53):**  to become involved in other ways.  
**[0:13:55-0:13:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:13:55):**  I think it's more than highly recommended.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:13:58):**  And what have you seen change over time?  
**[0:14:01-0:14:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:14:01):**  I mean, Schumacher College, I think, was founded 30 years ago.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:14:04):**  What has changed, if something, what has changed in the courses?  
**[0:14:07-0:14:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:14:07):**  What has changed in the outside world?  
**[0:14:09-0:14:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:14:09):**  Is there more attention or less attention?  
**[0:14:11-0:14:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:14:11):**  Has soil become more important finally?  
**[0:14:13-0:14:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:14:13):**  Or actually, we're at the same level as we were 30 years ago when you started?  
**[0:14:17-0:14:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:14:17):**  You know, this is good news.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:14:19):**  Let's start with that.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:14:20):**  When we started Schumacher College and when we started to talk about climate change, our  
**[0:14:26-0:14:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:14:26):**  first teacher was James Lovelock, the author of Gaia Hypothesis.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:14:31):**  That wasn't bad.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:14:32):**  Yeah.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:14:33):**  And at that time, James Lovelock was not listened to.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:14:38):**  People were not paying attention to the work of James Lovelock.  
**[0:14:41-0:14:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:14:41):**  And we were talking about climate change in 1991 and in the early 90s.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:14:46):**  At that time, they were not paying much attention.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:14:49):**  Everybody say, oh, it's not man-made.  
**[0:14:51-0:14:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:14:51):**  It's nothing to do with us.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:14:52):**  It's a kind of natural phenomena happening.  
**[0:14:55-0:14:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:14:55):**  And sometimes people say, maybe there is no climate change.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:14:58):**  But now, in the last 30 years, there has been a tremendous transformation in consciousness.  
**[0:15:05-0:15:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:15:05):**  More and more people around the world are rising to the challenge and realizing that  
**[0:15:11-0:15:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:15:11):**  we are facing a climate catastrophe.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:15:15):**  If we don't change our way, if we don't use more natural resources and more renewable  
**[0:15:22-0:15:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:15:22):**  energy resources, we are facing a great urgency.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:15:27):**  And we are facing a catastrophe as well.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:15:30):**  Because you know, the oil and the coal and the gas come from the underworld.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:15:37):**  We have to go deep down, thousands of meters under the world to get this dark gold.  
**[0:15:44-0:15:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:15:44):**  I call it energy from the hell because it's dark energy, underworld energy.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:15:53):**  So our answer to that is that we must go to the energy, which is light energy, energy  
**[0:15:59-0:16:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:15:59):**  from heaven.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:16:00):**  If you have energy from the sun, energy from the rain, energy from the wind, energy from  
**[0:16:07-0:16:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:16:07):**  the water, that energy is light energy, free of charge, provided by nature, which will  
**[0:16:14-0:16:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:16:14):**  use that energy from heaven.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:16:16):**  If you use energy from the hell, you create hell on earth.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:16:20):**  If you use energy from heaven, you create heaven on earth.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:16:25):**  Therefore, the climate change, answer to climate change is use energy from heaven.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:16:31):**  Then we can, there's an abundance of energy.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:16:35):**  Can you measure how much energy the sun provides?  
**[0:16:38-0:16:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:16:38):**  Can you imagine how much energy there is in the ocean and the tides and the wind?  
**[0:16:45-0:16:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:16:45):**  So there is no shortage of energy.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:16:48):**  We have to be frugal.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:16:49):**  We have to use only what we really need and not waste energy.  
**[0:16:53-0:16:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:16:53):**  At the moment, we are too much wasting energy.  
**[0:16:56-0:17:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:16:56):**  And so in 30 years of time since Chewbacca College started, we have seen a tremendous  
**[0:17:03-0:17:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:17:03):**  transformation of consciousness, tremendous change in people's thinking.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:17:08):**  And now our courses at Chewbacca College in gardening, in farming, in holistic science,  
**[0:17:14-0:17:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:17:14):**  in ecological design, in ecological and holistic economics, all the courses are being full.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:17:21):**  And there are many, many people want to come.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:17:23):**  And that's a great change that young people want to go back to nature.  
**[0:17:27-0:17:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:17:27):**  Young people want to work on the land.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:17:29):**  Young people want to grow food.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:17:31):**  And it's becoming respectful.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:17:33):**  And there's a good news.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:17:34):**  And I would like to encourage your listeners to put their money in land.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:17:40):**  The real investment is land.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:17:42):**  If you put your money in the land, that is your much better bank than Barclays Bank or  
**[0:17:47-0:17:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:17:47):**  HSC Bank or any bank of America or any other bank.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:17:52):**  The soil is the real bank.  
**[0:17:54-0:18:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:17:54):**  So I will encourage your listeners to revere soil and see soil as a real bank, not only  
**[0:18:02-0:18:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:18:02):**  bank for carbon, but even your capital, your money you put in the soil, that money, that  
**[0:18:08-0:18:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:18:08):**  land will last forever.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:18:11):**  And that land will give you food and clothes and houses and trees and animals.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:18:16):**  Everything will be looked after.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:18:18):**  So real investment in the land and in the soil is a real investment.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:18:23):**  And with this focus on or with this growth of consciousness on climate change, also a  
**[0:18:29-0:18:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:18:29):**  lot of people, let's say, don't take the nature approach.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:18:33):**  They go for technology fixes, cellular agriculture, lab grown meat.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:18:38):**  They go really to the, I would almost call it technological utopian.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:18:42):**  Like if we just fix a few technology things, we can grow a lot of food inside, et cetera,  
**[0:18:47-0:18:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:18:47):**  et cetera.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:18:48):**  I'm not here to debate that because we do that very often on the podcast, but I would  
**[0:18:52-0:18:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:18:52):**  wonder what do you say when you meet people like that, meet people that are in the city  
**[0:18:56-0:18:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:18:56):**  that are completely disconnected to nature?  
**[0:18:58-0:19:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:18:58):**  How do we get them on this journey as well?  
**[0:19:00-0:19:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:19:00):**  How do we get them to see the potential of the biomimicry movement, putting nature in  
**[0:19:06-0:19:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:19:06):**  the center and acknowledging that we are as much part of nature as anything else?  
**[0:19:11-0:19:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:19:11):**  How do we get more people to see that potential and to get interested in that instead of going  
**[0:19:16-0:19:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:19:16):**  for the quick fixes in the technology corner that all seem to save us constantly, but never  
**[0:19:21-0:19:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:19:21):**  do?  
**[0:19:22-0:19:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:19:22):**  Yes.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:19:23):**  So Einstein, the great scientist, he said that you cannot solve the problem with the  
**[0:19:29-0:19:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:19:29):**  same tools and the same mindset which created the problem in the first place.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:19:34):**  So the problems we face today in the world, including climate change, including the diminishing  
**[0:19:40-0:19:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:19:40):**  biodiversity and cultural diversity, and including all the pollution and waste we have today  
**[0:19:46-0:19:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:19:46):**  is created by technology, created by industry, which is run by technology.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:19:52):**  But then they say, if I say that, you cannot fix it.  
**[0:19:54-0:19:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:19:54):**  They say, yeah, but this technology is different.  
**[0:19:55-0:19:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:19:55):**  This time it's different.  
**[0:19:56-0:19:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:19:56):**  What do you say when you do a talk or when you did?  
**[0:19:59-0:20:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:19:59):**  Now again, you will hopefully soon, when somebody stands up and we have technology, and what  
**[0:20:04-0:20:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:20:04):**  do you respond to that?  
**[0:20:06-0:20:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:20:06):**  Technology has a place, but you must keep it in its place and not allow to think that  
**[0:20:11-0:20:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:20:11):**  technology can solve all your problems.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:20:14):**  Our problems are partly technological and solutions are partly technological, but more  
**[0:20:22-0:20:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:20:22):**  importantly, our attitude towards nature.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:20:25):**  At the moment, we see nature as a resource for the economy.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:20:29):**  That attitude has to change.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:20:31):**  Nature is more than a resource for the economy.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:20:35):**  Nature is a source of life itself.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:20:37):**  We have to think that nature is not just out there.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:20:41):**  The birds, the animals, the mountains, the forest, the rivers, and the oceans.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:20:46):**  We are also nature.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:20:48):**  We are also made of same elements as forests and mountains and animals are made of.  
**[0:20:54-0:20:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:20:54):**  We are made of earth, air, fire, water.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:20:58):**  We are made of consciousness.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:21:00):**  And earth is conscious.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:21:01):**  Nature is conscious.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:21:02):**  Nature is intelligent.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:21:03):**  Animals are intelligent.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:21:04):**  Trees have intelligence.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:21:05):**  So we have to change our attitude.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:21:06):**  This is a kind of attitude of deep ecology, where we say that nature has intrinsic value.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:21:15):**  As we recognize the rights of humans, we have to recognize the rights of nature.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:21:21):**  Nature also has rights.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:21:22):**  Rivers have rights.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:21:23):**  Forests have rights.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:21:24):**  The way we are treating nature at the moment is like war with nature.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:21:29):**  The way we are cutting down the rainforest in Amazon and in many other parts of the world  
**[0:21:35-0:21:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:21:35):**  is like war with nature.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:21:37):**  And the way we are treating animals in our factory farms in a cruelty way, that is also  
**[0:21:41-0:21:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:21:41):**  war with nature.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:21:43):**  So we have to make peace with nature.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:21:45):**  And so unless we change our attitude, unless we change our worldview, we are not going  
**[0:21:49-0:21:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:21:49):**  to solve problems just by technology.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:21:52):**  Technology has a place.  
**[0:21:53-0:22:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:21:53):**  But more importantly, our attitude, our values, and our spirituality, and our respect for  
**[0:22:00-0:22:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:22:00):**  nature, and the unity of nature and humans.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:22:03):**  Humans are nature.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:22:05):**  What we do to nature, we do to ourselves.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:22:07):**  If we pollute the water, we have to drink it.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:22:10):**  If we pollute the air, we have to breathe it.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:22:12):**  If we pollute the biosphere, atmosphere, we have to live with the global warming and climate  
**[0:22:17-0:22:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:22:17):**  change.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:22:18):**  What we do to nature, we do to ourselves.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:22:20):**  So unless we stop waste and pollution, unless we stop using nature as a resource for the  
**[0:22:26-0:22:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:22:26):**  economy and making more money, more money, more profit, we are not going to solve problems.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:22:32):**  Technology is not the answer.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:22:33):**  Technology can go so far.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:22:34):**  But more than that, we have to change our attitude and our relationship with nature.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:22:39):**  We have to learn to live in humility with nature and in harmony with nature.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:22:44):**  And so then I come back to the question, how do we bring people that are not seeing themselves  
**[0:22:49-0:22:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:22:49):**  as part of nature yet?  
**[0:22:50-0:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:22:50):**  What in your experience of the last few decades, what is the best way to reconnect people with  
**[0:22:56-0:22:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:22:56):**  nature?  
**[0:22:57-0:22:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:22:57):**  Is it gardening?  
**[0:22:58-0:22:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:22:58):**  Is it walking in nature?  
**[0:22:59-0:23:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:22:59):**  Forest?  
**[0:23:00-0:23:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:23:00):**  What has been the most effective or the best way?  
**[0:23:01-0:23:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:23:01):**  You've seen people that are those light bulbs go off like, oh, I'm actually part of this  
**[0:23:05-0:23:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:23:05):**  system and everything I do, I do to myself.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:23:08):**  What has been your experience there?  
**[0:23:10-0:23:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:23:10):**  Well, yes, I mean, your question is very good, because at the moment we feel disconnected  
**[0:23:15-0:23:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:23:15):**  from nature.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:23:16):**  And therefore we take nature for granted.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:23:19):**  But we are not in nature.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:23:20):**  We don't go in nature.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:23:22):**  So what I would like to say is that, practically speaking, every person should spend at least  
**[0:23:28-0:23:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:23:28):**  few hours a day or two or three days a week in the garden.  
**[0:23:33-0:23:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:23:33):**  When you touch the soil, when you touch the plants, when you touch the seeds, you know  
**[0:23:38-0:23:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:23:38):**  what nature is.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:23:39):**  And you know the magic of nature.  
**[0:23:41-0:23:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:23:41):**  You know the miracle of nature.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:23:43):**  You see nature, one seed of tomato becoming a plant and giving you 100 tomatoes, one seed  
**[0:23:51-0:23:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:23:51):**  of an apple tree giving you 1,000 apples.  
**[0:23:55-0:23:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:23:55):**  That miracle, that magic of nature.  
**[0:23:58-0:23:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:23:58):**  People don't know.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:23:59):**  People don't understand.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:24:00):**  Therefore, being in nature, walking in nature, I would say everybody, whoever you are, how  
**[0:24:06-0:24:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:24:06):**  busy you are, at least one hour, two hours every day, we should walk in nature, in the  
**[0:24:12-0:24:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:24:12):**  forest, along the river, among the trees, among the flowers, among the animals, and  
**[0:24:17-0:24:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:24:17):**  watch the birds, and see the butterflies, and see the bees.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:24:22):**  Unless you experience nature, you will not value nature.  
**[0:24:25-0:24:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:24:25):**  Unless you know nature, you will not love nature.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:24:27):**  And unless you love nature, you will not protect nature.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:24:30):**  So the way to do it is to, whether you are a prime minister, or a corporate leader, or  
**[0:24:35-0:24:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:24:35):**  a business leader, or an economist, or a professor, or a queen, or a queen, or whoever you are,  
**[0:24:42-0:24:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:24:42):**  you have to eat.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:24:43):**  And if you are eating, you must participate in growing the food.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:24:47):**  Even a prime minister, a president, should have a garden, and they should do some work  
**[0:24:51-0:24:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:24:51):**  in the gardening.  
**[0:24:52-0:24:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:24:52):**  That is the way that we can understand what nature is.  
**[0:24:56-0:24:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:24:56):**  Nature is miraculous, but we don't know nature.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:24:59):**  We know all the signs of Tesco, and BP, and Shell, and Apple, and all the websites we  
**[0:25:06-0:25:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:25:06):**  know, but we don't know the trees, we don't know the animals, we don't know the butterflies,  
**[0:25:11-0:25:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:25:11):**  we don't know nature.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:25:12):**  So there is a nature deficit disorder in the world.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:25:17):**  And therefore, we need to reconnect with nature.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:25:19):**  We have to go out in nature, spend some time in nature.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:25:23):**  Don't spend eight hours a day in front of your computer.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:25:27):**  Spend eight hours, or two hours, or three hours, or four hours, how much time you can  
**[0:25:31-0:25:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:25:31):**  spend out in nature, working in the garden, walking in nature, and writing poetry about  
**[0:25:37-0:25:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:25:37):**  nature, making a picture of nature, making a photograph of nature, painting a beautiful  
**[0:25:42-0:25:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:25:42):**  picture of nature.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:25:43):**  That is the way to reconnect with nature.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:25:45):**  And then when we have reconnected, and imagine there's a theater, we're in an old theater,  
**[0:25:51-0:25:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:25:51):**  and the listeners of this podcast are actually live with us, which we hope to do at some  
**[0:25:55-0:25:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:25:55):**  point.  
**[0:25:56-0:25:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:25:56):**  We are on stage, and people have done that in the week before.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:25:59):**  They have reconnected to nature, but they also bring their professional background.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:26:02):**  They might have worked in companies, they might have set up companies, they might be  
**[0:26:05-0:26:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:26:05):**  investors because they sold companies, et cetera.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:26:07):**  So they have resources, either time, experience, and money.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:26:11):**  What would you, of course, we don't give investment advice, but what would you tell them, what  
**[0:26:15-0:26:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:26:15):**  should be next for them?  
**[0:26:16-0:26:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:26:16):**  What should be next after they are reconnected with nature?  
**[0:26:20-0:26:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:26:20):**  How should they apply their resources or put their resources to work to regenerate nature  
**[0:26:24-0:26:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:26:24):**  and to reconnect more people potentially with nature?  
**[0:26:27-0:26:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:26:27):**  What would you tell them what would be some interesting places to get started?  
**[0:26:31-0:26:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:26:31):**  To regenerate nature, we have to embrace the idea of circular economy.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:26:36):**  At the moment, our economy is linear.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:26:39):**  We take from nature, use it, and throw it away on the landfills.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:26:45):**  And we are wasting so much natural resources and plastic in the oceans and sewage in the  
**[0:26:50-0:26:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:26:50):**  rivers.  
**[0:26:51-0:27:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:26:51):**  So what we need to do is to invest your capital, your time, your talent, your energy in cyclical  
**[0:27:01-0:27:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:27:01):**  or circular economy.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:27:03):**  Whatever comes from nature must go back to nature.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:27:07):**  Economy of nature is circular, but the industrial economy is linear.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:27:12):**  We have to change industrial economy, which is linear economy, into the economy of nature,  
**[0:27:17-0:27:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:27:17):**  which is a circular economy.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:27:19):**  In nature, there is no waste.  
**[0:27:21-0:27:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:27:21):**  In nature, there is no pollution.  
**[0:27:23-0:27:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:27:23):**  All the trees come from the soil, become the trees, give leaves, give fruit, and go back  
**[0:27:30-0:27:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:27:30):**  to soil.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:27:31):**  And in between, you can eat and you can celebrate.  
**[0:27:34-0:27:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:27:34):**  So circular economy, where everything is going back to nature and there's no waste, zero  
**[0:27:40-0:27:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:27:40):**  waste, and zero pollution.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:27:42):**  If you can invest your capital in zero waste, zero pollution, circular economy, then you  
**[0:27:49-0:27:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:27:49):**  are making good investment for the future.  
**[0:27:51-0:27:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:27:51):**  If you are investing your money, which create waste and pollution and climate change and  
**[0:27:57-0:28:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:27:57):**  carbon emission, all that kind of investment is going to bring catastrophe to our children  
**[0:28:02-0:28:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:28:02):**  and grandchildren and many, many future generations to come.  
**[0:28:05-0:28:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:28:05):**  Therefore, wise investment is investment in economy, which is mimicking the nature.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:28:13):**  Nature's economy, economy of nature, is circular economy.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:28:18):**  So make that as your teacher.  
**[0:28:21-0:28:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:28:21):**  Nature is your teacher.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:28:23):**  Nature is our mentor.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:28:25):**  And if we can learn from nature, and nature has survived for billions of years.  
**[0:28:30-0:28:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:28:30):**  Nature has been here for billions of years.  
**[0:28:32-0:28:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:28:32):**  For we humans, just in the last three, four hundred years, we have made a mess of the  
**[0:28:36-0:28:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:28:36):**  world.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:28:37):**  And therefore, we have to be humble and we have to say that we will learn from nature.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:28:41):**  Nature is our great teacher.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:28:43):**  What would you do?  
**[0:28:44-0:28:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:28:44):**  Let's say tomorrow morning you wake up and you are an investment manager, not in a suit  
**[0:28:49-0:28:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:28:49):**  in London.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:28:50):**  I won't do that to you.  
**[0:28:51-0:28:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:28:51):**  You can stay in your beautiful house, but you have, let's say, a very, very considerable  
**[0:28:56-0:28:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:28:56):**  investment amount, let's say a billion pounds.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:28:59):**  What would you focus on?  
**[0:29:01-0:29:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:29:01):**  You said land before, which you spend it all on land, which you focus on education, on  
**[0:29:04-0:29:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:29:04):**  technology, on food companies, on nature walks.  
**[0:29:08-0:29:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:29:08):**  What would you, if you turned an investor tomorrow morning, what would you?  
**[0:29:11-0:29:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:29:11):**  I don't think any new investment is needed for new technology.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:29:16):**  We have got plenty of investment already in technology.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:29:19):**  There is no shortage of technology.  
**[0:29:22-0:29:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:29:22):**  Bill Gates of this world have already made a big mess of this world already with technology.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:29:27):**  So we don't need more investment technology.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:29:29):**  I would say either partner with a farmer and invest money so that the produce of the farm  
**[0:29:37-0:29:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:29:37):**  are transformed into food.  
**[0:29:39-0:29:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:29:39):**  For example, if you are producing grapes, that grape should be transformed on the farm  
**[0:29:45-0:29:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:29:45):**  into wine.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:29:46):**  If you are producing milk, that should be transformed into cheese and butter and many  
**[0:29:51-0:29:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:29:51):**  other things.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:29:52):**  If you are transforming vegetables, transform them.  
**[0:29:55-0:30:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:29:55):**  If you are producing vegetables, transform them into more preserves so that farmers get  
**[0:30:00-0:30:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:30:00):**  better income.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:30:02):**  At the moment, farmers sell very cheaply to supermarkets.  
**[0:30:07-0:30:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:30:07):**  Supermarkets make a big profit and become rich, and farmers remain poor.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:30:13):**  I think we need to invest money to make farmers better off and live better life and have more  
**[0:30:19-0:30:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:30:19):**  respect and more dignity.  
**[0:30:22-0:30:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:30:22):**  At the moment, the dignity of farming is lost, and we need to bring back that dignity to  
**[0:30:28-0:30:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:30:28):**  farming.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:30:29):**  I would say if you have capital, if you have money, invest in land, make partnership with  
**[0:30:35-0:30:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:30:35):**  a farmer and make farming food should be a source of joy, a source of celebration, a  
**[0:30:42-0:30:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:30:42):**  source of not only food to eat, but also to celebrate.  
**[0:30:46-0:30:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:30:46):**  That is missing at the moment.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:30:48):**  The factory farms are so ugly and so much wasteful and so much smelling and a bad smell,  
**[0:30:55-0:30:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:30:55):**  and it's bad farming at the moment.  
**[0:30:57-0:31:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:30:57):**  Make farming good farming.  
**[0:31:00-0:31:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:31:00):**  I prefer also small farms.  
**[0:31:02-0:31:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:31:02):**  Invest in small farms, 50 acres, 100 acres, 200 acres, not large monolithic in the United  
**[0:31:09-0:31:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:31:09):**  States.  
**[0:31:10-0:31:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:31:10):**  You can farm with 10,000 acres or 20,000 acres.  
**[0:31:12-0:31:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:31:12):**  In Australia, maybe you can get even 50,000 or 100,000 acres.  
**[0:31:16-0:31:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:31:16):**  That is a madness in farming.  
**[0:31:19-0:31:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:31:19):**  Farming is to love the land.  
**[0:31:20-0:31:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:31:20):**  Farming is to care for the land.  
**[0:31:23-0:31:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:31:23):**  Farming is to respect the land and work with the land.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:31:26):**  If you don't put your hands in the soil and don't make your hands dirty, then you are  
**[0:31:30-0:31:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:31:30):**  not a good farmer.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:31:32):**  Always remember, dirt is not dirty.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:31:35):**  Dirt is sacred.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:31:37):**  Land and soil is sacred.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:31:39):**  All farmers should touch the earth, touch the soil, and look after the animals, and  
**[0:31:43-0:31:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:31:43):**  look after the trees and the forests and plants.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:31:46):**  That is a true investment.  
**[0:31:48-0:31:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:31:48):**  If you had a magic power to change one thing overnight in the food and agriculture system,  
**[0:31:54-0:31:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:31:54):**  what would that one thing be?  
**[0:31:55-0:31:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:31:55):**  It could be anything.  
**[0:31:56-0:32:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:31:56):**  Global consciousness, taste, no longer CAFOs, anything you can imagine.  
**[0:32:01-0:32:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:32:01):**  What would you change overnight if you had to change one thing?  
**[0:32:05-0:32:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:32:05):**  One thing I would like to change is ban all artificial chemical fertilizers from the land.  
**[0:32:14-0:32:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:32:14):**  Because those artificial fertilizers like pesticide and herbicide and all the other  
**[0:32:20-0:32:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:32:20):**  similar things should be totally banned.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:32:22):**  They should be seen as a crime against the soil.  
**[0:32:25-0:32:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:32:25):**  Because soil, the living soil, if you feed people instead of feeding food and good food  
**[0:32:32-0:32:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:32:32):**  and good fruit and good vegetables, if you feed people only with chemicals, human beings  
**[0:32:37-0:32:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:32:37):**  are not going to be very happy.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:32:40):**  Soil should be fed with good food, good compost.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:32:43):**  We have to build the soil with lots of good compost.  
**[0:32:48-0:32:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:32:48):**  By putting herbicide and pesticide and chemicals and poisonous things into the soil is a crime  
**[0:32:54-0:33:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:32:54):**  against nature, like we are treating humans by feeding them only with chemicals.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:33:00):**  Soil is a living soil, and we should always respect that living quality.  
**[0:33:03-0:33:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:33:03):**  So that's one thing I would like to ban all kinds of chemicals and poisonous herbicide  
**[0:33:11-0:33:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:33:11):**  and pesticide.  
**[0:33:12-0:33:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:33:12):**  The number two I would like to say is that ban all genetic engineering of seeds.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:33:19):**  Because we have to respect the nature.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:33:22):**  Nature knows better than all the technological industrialists and the scientists put together.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:33:28):**  We need to humble and save our seeds, protect our seeds, and make farmers free to save their  
**[0:33:35-0:33:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:33:35):**  seeds so that they can use and reuse and reuse their seeds.  
**[0:33:40-0:33:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:33:40):**  So all genetic engineering of seeds should be banned.  
**[0:33:44-0:33:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:33:44):**  So no chemical pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers, and no genetically engineered  
**[0:33:50-0:33:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:33:50):**  seeds.  
**[0:33:51-0:33:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:33:51):**  These are the two things absolutely essential in order to make good farming for the future.  
**[0:33:56-0:34:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:33:56):**  How do we reach, because many poor communities are often also the most degraded, and maybe  
**[0:34:02-0:34:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:34:02):**  not even for the last 400 years, but for the last 10,000 years or even more since we started  
**[0:34:07-0:34:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:34:07):**  agriculture or started agriculture a bit more seriously.  
**[0:34:10-0:34:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:34:10):**  How do we reach the poorest and the most degraded communities of this planet, which aren't in  
**[0:34:15-0:34:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:34:15):**  the UK where you're now or in the Netherlands where I am?  
**[0:34:18-0:34:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:34:18):**  They're different places.  
**[0:34:19-0:34:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:34:19):**  Is there a role for, let's say, the finance world for investors?  
**[0:34:23-0:34:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:34:23):**  What do you see there as you have traveled a lot to reach the poorest?  
**[0:34:27-0:34:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:34:27):**  You know, the communities are degraded because of the history of colonialism, imperialism,  
**[0:34:37-0:34:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:34:37):**  racism, slavery, and industrial exploitation.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:34:41):**  The Western European countries like UK, France, Netherlands, Spain, Italy, all these countries  
**[0:34:51-0:34:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:34:51):**  have been responsible for degrading the countries in Africa and Asia and South America.  
**[0:34:57-0:35:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:34:57):**  The Europeans have gone to South America in Brazil and Mexico and the United States, which  
**[0:35:03-0:35:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:35:03):**  is North America and Canada.  
**[0:35:05-0:35:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:35:05):**  We have made a mess with our kind of arrogant thinking that we know better.  
**[0:35:11-0:35:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:35:11):**  We are civilized, and the people there in Africa and Asia are not civilized.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:35:15):**  So we have to go and civilize them.  
**[0:35:17-0:35:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:35:17):**  We have to bring them industry.  
**[0:35:18-0:35:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:35:18):**  We have to bring them technology of the kind which they don't know.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:35:22):**  So that way, we have degraded and then deprived many, many small rural communities.  
**[0:35:29-0:35:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:35:29):**  And they have lost their value of land.  
**[0:35:32-0:35:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:35:32):**  They have lost the value of food.  
**[0:35:34-0:35:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:35:34):**  They have lost the skills to make clothes, to build houses.  
**[0:35:38-0:35:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:35:38):**  So poor are poor not because they are stupid.  
**[0:35:41-0:35:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:35:41):**  Poor are poor because the powerful and rich nations have exploited them, suppressed them,  
**[0:35:47-0:35:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:35:47):**  ignored them.  
**[0:35:48-0:35:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:35:48):**  Therefore, we need to give them freedom and the land so they can grow their food, they  
**[0:35:52-0:35:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:35:52):**  can build their houses, they can make their clothes, they can make their shoes, they can  
**[0:35:56-0:35:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:35:56):**  make their furniture, they can live a good life.  
**[0:35:59-0:36:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:35:59):**  But they have the two hands.  
**[0:36:00-0:36:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:36:00):**  They have a tradition.  
**[0:36:01-0:36:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:36:01):**  They have a culture.  
**[0:36:02-0:36:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:36:02):**  They have intelligence.  
**[0:36:03-0:36:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:36:03):**  They have everything.  
**[0:36:04-0:36:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:36:04):**  Poor are poor not because of themselves.  
**[0:36:06-0:36:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:36:06):**  Poor are poor because of us, the very rich in the Western world.  
**[0:36:10-0:36:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:36:10):**  And so what would you say to investors or also people, entrepreneurs that are starting  
**[0:36:15-0:36:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:36:15):**  companies or wanting to start companies in these more degraded areas, in the poorer places?  
**[0:36:20-0:36:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:36:20):**  Because that's where most impact can be made.  
**[0:36:22-0:36:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:36:22):**  That's where the potential of impacting as many lives as possible and impact as much  
**[0:36:27-0:36:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:36:27):**  soil as possible is potentially the greatest.  
**[0:36:29-0:36:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:36:29):**  How do we approach that without making the same mistakes as we've made in the past?  
**[0:36:33-0:36:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:36:33):**  And we're still making because we're still trying to push technology.  
**[0:36:35-0:36:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:36:35):**  We're still trying to push.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:36:36):**  We know better.  
**[0:36:37-0:36:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:36:37):**  Let's educate, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:36:39-0:36:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:36:39):**  How do we approach that differently to make sure we don't make that mistake?  
**[0:36:42-0:36:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:36:42):**  Because we can bring something in some cases, some resources, some experience, some money,  
**[0:36:46-0:36:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:36:46):**  obviously, or processing or markets that are interested in the coffee, the cacao and a  
**[0:36:50-0:36:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:36:50):**  lot of products from there.  
**[0:36:52-0:36:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:36:52):**  How do we approach that differently to make sure we don't fall in the same trap?  
**[0:36:55-0:37:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:36:55):**  First of all, when we invest money in poor countries like India or Africa or many other  
**[0:37:02-0:37:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:37:02):**  countries, we have to say the people who are living in the villages, they should remain  
**[0:37:09-0:37:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:37:09):**  in the villages.  
**[0:37:10-0:37:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:37:10):**  Villages are very beautiful, part of nature.  
**[0:37:13-0:37:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:37:13):**  Villages surrounded by trees and birds and lakes and rivers and beauty and serenity.  
**[0:37:21-0:37:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:37:21):**  Just the idea that we all need to be brought into industrial system of urbanized and roads  
**[0:37:28-0:37:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:37:28):**  and cars and kind of aeroplanes and airports and seaports and all that kind of infrastructure  
**[0:37:35-0:37:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:37:35):**  is not necessary.  
**[0:37:37-0:37:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:37:37):**  Villages are very beautiful.  
**[0:37:39-0:37:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:37:39):**  They have integrity.  
**[0:37:40-0:37:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:37:40):**  They are natural and they have less impact on nature and they are frugal.  
**[0:37:45-0:37:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:37:45):**  Therefore, that village culture, the rural culture and the rural reconstruction should  
**[0:37:49-0:37:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:37:49):**  be maintained.  
**[0:37:50-0:37:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:37:50):**  Number two, when you are going into third world countries like Africa or Asia, do not  
**[0:37:56-0:37:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:37:56):**  think that you know better.  
**[0:37:58-0:37:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:37:58):**  Give them land.  
**[0:37:59-0:38:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:37:59):**  If the poor people have no land, give them some help to buy the land or have the land  
**[0:38:05-0:38:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:38:05):**  so that they have land.  
**[0:38:06-0:38:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:38:06):**  If you have land, that will give you work.  
**[0:38:10-0:38:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:38:10):**  Land will give you employment.  
**[0:38:12-0:38:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:38:12):**  Land will give you jobs.  
**[0:38:14-0:38:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:38:14):**  Land will give you food.  
**[0:38:15-0:38:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:38:15):**  Land will give you trees and fruit and herbs.  
**[0:38:18-0:38:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:38:18):**  Land will give you houses.  
**[0:38:20-0:38:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:38:20):**  Land is the source of life.  
**[0:38:22-0:38:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:38:22):**  If you can help people to have land, that is one thing, good investment.  
**[0:38:28-0:38:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:38:28):**  Then of course, when they are producing food and so on, they can share back something to  
**[0:38:33-0:38:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:38:33):**  the investors.  
**[0:38:34-0:38:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:38:34):**  I have no difficulty.  
**[0:38:35-0:38:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:38:35):**  Five percent, 10 percent of their produce can be given back to the investors.  
**[0:38:40-0:38:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:38:40):**  The 80 to 90 percent of investment should benefit the local people who are being helped.  
**[0:38:47-0:38:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:38:47):**  The land is the best investment.  
**[0:38:49-0:38:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:38:49):**  That is what I would say.  
**[0:38:50-0:38:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:38:50):**  Let the farmers and the laborers and the workers in the rural areas develop their own culture  
**[0:38:58-0:39:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:38:58):**  and develop their own wisdom.  
**[0:39:00-0:39:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:39:00):**  You do not have to export wisdom, which is not really so much wisdom, from the Western  
**[0:39:04-0:39:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:39:04):**  countries and industrial technological paradigm.  
**[0:39:08-0:39:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:39:08):**  We do not need it.  
**[0:39:09-0:39:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:39:09):**  Rural paradigm with agriculture, agro-economy and agricultural culture.  
**[0:39:15-0:39:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:39:15):**  Agriculture, that is a real culture.  
**[0:39:17-0:39:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:39:17):**  We have to be humble.  
**[0:39:19-0:39:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:39:19):**  The Western people who are investing money in poorer countries, they have to be humble  
**[0:39:24-0:39:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:39:24):**  and they have to respect the poor.  
**[0:39:25-0:39:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:39:25):**  The poor have wisdom more than we, the rich, think they have.  
**[0:39:30-0:39:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:39:30):**  We need to respect them.  
**[0:39:31-0:39:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:39:31):**  I want to ask a final question, it never is.  
**[0:39:35-0:39:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:39:35):**  At Schumacher College, seeing this movement, you have traveled the world, you have walked  
**[0:39:40-0:39:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:39:40):**  the world, what has been the biggest surprise over the last 30, 40, 50 years?  
**[0:39:47-0:39:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:39:47):**  What makes you wake up in the morning with so much energy, which radiates through the  
**[0:39:52-0:39:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:39:52):**  screen?  
**[0:39:53-0:39:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:39:53):**  I can see the video, people can only hear the audio, but I would definitely encourage  
**[0:39:56-0:39:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:39:56):**  people to watch some talks, etc.  
**[0:39:58-0:40:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:39:58):**  What keeps you so energetic and what has been that surprise or that flame of energy that  
**[0:40:03-0:40:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:40:03):**  keeps you going?  
**[0:40:04-0:40:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:40:04):**  What keeps me going is the young people.  
**[0:40:07-0:40:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:40:07):**  I'm amazed at how increasing number of young people are waking up.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:40:14):**  Is it really that different from 20, 30 years ago?  
**[0:40:17-0:40:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:40:17):**  Because I live in my bubble, but you've seen that difference, you've seen that growth.  
**[0:40:20-0:40:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:40:20):**  Yes, I see the difference.  
**[0:40:22-0:40:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:40:22):**  The greater Thunberg generation is something amazing.  
**[0:40:26-0:40:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:40:26):**  There are hundreds of thousands of young boys and girls around the world are marching for  
**[0:40:32-0:40:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:40:32):**  climate change and climate sustainability and ecology and regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:40:39-0:40:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:40:39):**  Hundreds of thousands of young people in India, in China, in Africa, in America, in Europe,  
**[0:40:44-0:40:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:40:44):**  everywhere, this is a great new development.  
**[0:40:47-0:40:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:40:47):**  At Schumacher College, young people are coming to learn gardening.  
**[0:40:51-0:40:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:40:51):**  Young people are coming to learn how to live in harmony with nature.  
**[0:40:55-0:40:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:40:55):**  They don't want PhD for their personal success.  
**[0:40:58-0:41:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:40:58):**  This change among the younger generation gives me tremendous hope.  
**[0:41:02-0:41:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:41:02):**  I'm 85 years old.  
**[0:41:04-0:41:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:41:04):**  When I see young people coming up to me and saying that we want to learn about how to  
**[0:41:09-0:41:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:41:09):**  grow food and how to live simple life, and they are buying my book, Elegant Simplicity,  
**[0:41:14-0:41:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:41:14):**  and they are buying my book, Pilgrimage for Peace, and they want to say, we want to do  
**[0:41:17-0:41:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:41:17):**  something like you did when you were young.

**[0:44:38-0:44:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:44:38):**  We're gonna look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:44:43-0:44:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:44:43):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:44:49-0:44:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:44:49):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[0:44:53-0:44:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:44:53):**  if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:44:55-0:45:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:44:55):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:45:00-0:45:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:45:00):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.

**[0:45:09-0:45:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:45:09):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:45:11-0:45:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:45:11):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:45:14-0:45:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:45:14):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:45:17-0:45:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/satish-kumar#t=0:45:17):**  It's also not investment advice.

**[0:00:16-0:00:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:00:16):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture, investing as if  
**[0:00:20-0:00:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:00:20):**  the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:00:21):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:26-0:00:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:00:26):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:00:31-0:00:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:00:31):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:00:36):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:38-0:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:00:38):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:00:42-0:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:00:42):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:00:44):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:00:49-0:00:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:00:49):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:00:53-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:00:53):**  In March last year, we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support  
**[0:00:58-0:00:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:00:58):**  our work.

**[0:01:18-0:01:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:01:18):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:19-0:01:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:01:19):**  How did a medical doctor ended up going deep?  
**[0:01:22-0:01:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:01:22):**  Very deep on soil and discovering that almost all health issues can be traced back to how  
**[0:01:27-0:01:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:01:27):**  we treat our soils.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:01:28):**  Learn about the role of glyphosate and other chemicals and why after seeing all this doom  
**[0:01:33-0:01:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:01:33):**  and gloom, he actually has a lot of hope for the human species.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:01:38):**  So welcome to another episode.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:01:40):**  Today with Dr. Zach Bush.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:01:41):**  Dr. Zach Bush is a renowned multidisciplinary physician of internal medicine, endocrinology,  
**[0:01:48-0:01:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:01:48):**  hospice care and international recognized educator on the microbiome as it relates to  
**[0:01:52-0:01:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:01:52):**  health, human health, soil health, food systems and a regenerative future.  
**[0:01:57-0:01:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:01:57):**  Welcome Dr. Zach.  
**[0:01:58-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:01:58):**  Thanks so much Colin for having me on.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:02:00):**  It's a real pleasure to be with you.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:02:02):**  And for anybody that doesn't know your story, what does a doctor do looking at healthy soils?  
**[0:02:09-0:02:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:02:09):**  Every doctor should do that, but not many do.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:02:11):**  So why are you doing that?  
**[0:02:13-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:02:13):**  I'm probably the most unlikely of soil advocates out there, but yeah, it was a long journey  
**[0:02:18-0:02:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:02:18):**  so I spent 17 years in academic medicine, learning medicine from many different perspectives  
**[0:02:24-0:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:02:24):**  of biochemistry, cellular biology, pharmaceutical management, disease and ultimately worked  
**[0:02:31-0:02:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:02:31):**  for many years in the hospital system at the University of Virginia after my doctorate  
**[0:02:36-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:02:36):**  at the University of Colorado.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:02:37):**  I did all my postdoctoral specialization there at the University of Virginia and in that  
**[0:02:43-0:02:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:02:43):**  journey I worked into endocrinology after four years of internal medicine work which  
**[0:02:48-0:02:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:02:48):**  was kind of hospital-based and a little bit of outpatient care, doing chronic disease  
**[0:02:52-0:02:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:02:52):**  management mostly and compensation of those chronic diseases in the hospital.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:02:57):**  Things like kidney disease, liver disease, gastrointestinal diseases, cardiovascular,  
**[0:03:01-0:03:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:03:01):**  stroke, heart attacks, moving into the cancers and all of that.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:03:05):**  You tend to rotate through many different wards especially when you're in residency,  
**[0:03:10-0:03:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:03:10):**  you take your bone marrow transplant ward and cancer wards and then you're suddenly  
**[0:03:15-0:03:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:03:15):**  on the GI ward.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:03:16):**  So I had this very holistic I guess image of the current landscape of chronic disease  
**[0:03:22-0:03:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:03:22):**  in the United States that was certainly accelerated if not emerging for the first time in late  
**[0:03:29-0:03:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:03:29):**  1990s, early 2000s and it was just a coincidence that I showed up at this moment in history  
**[0:03:35-0:03:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:03:35):**  where we hit this brink or tipping point of human health where we saw a sudden epidemic  
**[0:03:42-0:03:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:03:42):**  phenomenon in chronic disease which had never been seen before.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:03:47):**  Epidemics had always been relegated to world of infectious disease and things like this.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:03:51):**  But to see things like cancer double rates in just 20 years was impossible based on our  
**[0:03:59-0:04:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:03:59):**  current model at the time of what is cancer.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:04:01):**  Cancer is supposed to take 17 years to develop in an individual, supposed to be an accumulation  
**[0:04:06-0:04:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:04:06):**  of genetic breaks that go on unrepaired and end up with dysfunction.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:04:11):**  To see it double in just a short period of time in the entire population with a very  
**[0:04:16-0:04:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:04:16):**  heterogeneous genetic background that the United States has, to see that explosion happen  
**[0:04:22-0:04:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:04:22):**  simultaneous to this massive surge in neurodegenerative diseases in our children appearing with autism  
**[0:04:29-0:04:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:04:29):**  spectrum disorders by the time they're one and a half, two years old, moving into attention  
**[0:04:34-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:04:34):**  deficit hyperactivity disorder for those that hadn't been diagnosed with the autism and  
**[0:04:39-0:04:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:04:39):**  then really bizarre dysfunction of immune system and saw severe allergies and environmental  
**[0:04:46-0:04:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:04:46):**  sensitivities and intolerances emerge in that same period of time, late 1990s, early 2000s.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:04:53):**  The phenomenon of gluten sensitivity emerged for the first time.  
**[0:04:56-0:05:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:04:56):**  It was just like this bizarre explosion of dysfunction.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:05:01):**  And ultimately what we were seeing was that humans living on Earth were starting to fail  
**[0:05:07-0:05:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:05:07):**  to live within Earth's environment.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:05:09):**  You think back to like those Star Trek movies that we grew up with.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:05:14):**  You see Spock land on the planet and teleported down and he uses his telecommunicator to take  
**[0:05:22-0:05:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:05:22):**  back to the Enterprise to say, good news, this amenable to life, there's oxygen here,  
**[0:05:29-0:05:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:05:29):**  there's water.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:05:30):**  That whole concept of a planet that's capable of supporting life was starting to decay and  
**[0:05:36-0:05:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:05:36):**  we were starting to see children born intolerant to their environment as if the planet was  
**[0:05:41-0:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:05:41):**  suddenly not built for them.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:05:43):**  Suddenly the planet was not amenable to their survival.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:05:47):**  We're seeing kids with cancer by the time they're two years old, five years old, nobody's  
**[0:05:51-0:05:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:05:51):**  seen solid tumors develop like sarcomas and things like this.  
**[0:05:55-0:06:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:05:55):**  We used to see those as a 17, 18 year old, but now we're seeing osteosarcoma and these  
**[0:06:00-0:06:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:06:00):**  bizarre cardiac sarcomas and soft tissue tumors and it didn't make sense.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:06:06):**  And of course I had no history, I was a brand new physician and everything else.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:06:09):**  So it's like, okay, well maybe this is the state of affairs.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:06:13):**  But by the time I was a chief resident and on faculty teaching residents and med students,  
**[0:06:20-0:06:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:06:20):**  there's nothing like teaching to learn something, right?  
**[0:06:22-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:06:22):**  That's what they say.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:06:23):**  And that certainly was the case for me.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:06:24):**  And I suddenly went in that year from really believing I was at the pinnacle of knowledge  
**[0:06:29-0:06:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:06:29):**  in this space of being a physician and the scientific mind and all this.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:06:34):**  By the time I started teaching and really digging into literature, I realized this is  
**[0:06:38-0:06:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:06:38):**  new.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:06:39):**  Like we've never had this situation before.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:06:41):**  We've never had this degree of cancers and everything else.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:06:44):**  Not to mention, we were right at the beginning of the obesity epidemic in the United States.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:06:48):**  We were seeing skyrocketing rates of obesity and metabolic disorders, diabetes and the  
**[0:06:53-0:06:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:06:53):**  like.  
**[0:06:54-0:06:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:06:54):**  That shaped a lot of my decision going into endocrinology.  
**[0:06:56-0:07:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:06:56):**  And endocrinology is the focus of hormones and how they dictate and coordinate human  
**[0:07:00-0:07:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:07:00):**  health and beyond human health.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:07:03):**  Any multicellular organism is going to ultimately rely upon this endocrine system of signaling  
**[0:07:07-0:07:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:07:07):**  communication to coordinate complex systems.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:07:11):**  What made you choose to go in there?  
**[0:07:12-0:07:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:07:12):**  Because you saw this explosion of 10, 20 types of very serious diseases and circumstances.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:07:20):**  You could have chosen any different path to dive deeper into any of them separately, but  
**[0:07:25-0:07:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:07:25):**  you chose this specific path.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:07:27):**  Do you remember why or how that happened?  
**[0:07:30-0:07:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:07:30):**  Yeah, I do.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:07:31):**  It had to do with a real desire to find a cohesive root cause for what was going on  
**[0:07:36-0:07:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:07:36):**  in my patients.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:07:37):**  And I loved cardiology.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:07:39):**  I loved nephrology, which is kidney disease study.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:07:44):**  I loved my neuropsychology stuff going on.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:07:48):**  Some of my early research was in neuropsych, understanding the plasticity of the brain  
**[0:07:51-0:07:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:07:51):**  and how it changes.  
**[0:07:53-0:07:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:07:53):**  But I realized that if I was going to go into any of those, I'd be pigeonholed into one  
**[0:07:57-0:07:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:07:57):**  viewpoint.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:07:58):**  And I was seeing diseases happen across all organ spectrum.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:08:02):**  So I felt like if I go into cardiology, I'm not going to ever understand what the root  
**[0:08:06-0:08:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:08:06):**  causes of this situation is.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:08:08):**  So the endocrine system, which dictates all of the organ systems at once, seemed like  
**[0:08:12-0:08:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:08:12):**  a good place to go if I was ever going to get some sort of holistic understanding of  
**[0:08:16-0:08:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:08:16):**  the mechanisms.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:08:18):**  And before I was going to go into medicine, I actually had no idea I was going to be a  
**[0:08:21-0:08:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:08:21):**  doctor.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:08:22):**  I had no plans of being in medicine at all in my early part of my life.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:08:25):**  I was a mechanic and I did construction.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:08:28):**  I was always working with my hands.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:08:30):**  I wanted to be a robotics engineer, got accepted to an engineering program at the University  
**[0:08:34-0:08:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:08:34):**  of Colorado.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:08:35):**  And then only as a 19-year-old can have this kind of drama is I had a girlfriend, she broke  
**[0:08:41-0:08:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:08:41):**  up with me, cheated on me, whatever.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:08:43):**  And I was like so heartbroken, I convinced myself that I was so heartbroken as a 19-year-old,  
**[0:08:47-0:08:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:08:47):**  I needed a year off just to recover from this, which was so dramatic and silly in retrospect,  
**[0:08:52-0:08:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:08:52):**  but it completely changed my life in that year off.  
**[0:08:55-0:08:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:08:55):**  So you did need it.  
**[0:08:57-0:08:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:08:57):**  Yeah, I needed it.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:08:59):**  And for reasons I didn't understand, I took that year off.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:09:01):**  And instead of going into my engineering program, I went to the Philippines with an aunt of  
**[0:09:05-0:09:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:09:05):**  mine who was working with a group of international midwives, birthing babies over in the Philippines.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:09:10):**  And that was my turning point.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:09:12):**  That's when everything kind of fell apart in my previous world.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:09:15):**  I had never seen poverty like what's happening in the squats of Manila, outside of Manila  
**[0:09:20-0:09:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:09:20):**  and Quezon City there.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:09:22):**  I had never seen this degree of malnutrition.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:09:26):**  I had never seen so much of what I saw there.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:09:28):**  I had never seen this level of injustice towards women and children.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:09:31):**  I had never seen this level of abuse of a society.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:09:34):**  The Philippines has been chronically abused by occupying nation states for hundreds of  
**[0:09:41-0:09:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:09:41):**  years.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:09:42):**  And so it was just a really broken human system that I got introduced to.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:09:46):**  And out of that was this birth of children that was so extraordinary.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:09:49):**  And these children were resilient.  
**[0:09:51-0:09:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:09:51):**  I watched babies born into the squalor of what seemed like filth at the time and just  
**[0:09:57-0:10:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:09:57):**  this complete depravity, it felt like, of human.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:10:00):**  And yet these children were resilient, healthy and so hopeful and full of joy and running  
**[0:10:05-0:10:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:10:05):**  around with plastic bags taped up like a soccer ball and they would play for 10 hours of sheer  
**[0:10:11-0:10:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:10:11):**  joy in a parking lot with a fake soccer ball that they taped together.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:10:16):**  And I wasn't seeing that level of joy in my own life as a child.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:10:19):**  I wasn't seeing that same level of exuberance.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:10:22):**  And so I was starting to have this dissidence between what the West would call wellness  
**[0:10:27-0:10:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:10:27):**  and wealth and what I was seeing on the ground there.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:10:30):**  And I was seeing this connection to mothers and children for the first time in a way I  
**[0:10:33-0:10:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:10:33):**  couldn't have understood it previous to that.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:10:36):**  And that whole journey was starting to set me up for this reality that I now live in  
**[0:10:41-0:10:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:10:41):**  today, which is where is the foundation of life?  
**[0:10:44-0:10:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:10:44):**  And then how do we define once we're alive, quality of life and how do we foster that  
**[0:10:49-0:10:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:10:49):**  quality of life, which goes beyond your blood pressure and your cholesterol level and all  
**[0:10:55-0:10:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:10:55):**  this.  
**[0:10:56-0:11:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:10:56):**  And things like your sense of spiritual connection to the Mother Earth, your sense of thrive  
**[0:11:00-0:11:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:11:00):**  within that Mother Earth, your sense of providence from that Mother Earth and nature that we  
**[0:11:05-0:11:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:11:05):**  were developed within.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:11:07):**  And so that I think is what set me up for this journey into a deeper and deeper dive  
**[0:11:13-0:11:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:11:13):**  onto where are we coming from?  
**[0:11:15-0:11:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:11:15):**  Why are we here and why are we starting to fail as a species?  
**[0:11:19-0:11:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:11:19):**  How is it that we brought ourselves to this brink of extinction?  
**[0:11:23-0:11:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:11:23):**  You know, the numbers were very clear by 2005, 2010, we've got less than 100 years left as  
**[0:11:29-0:11:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:11:29):**  a species at our current rate of decline.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:11:31):**  And now that number is accelerated.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:11:33):**  Can you explain that a bit?  
**[0:11:34-0:11:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:11:34):**  Because for some that might sound as a shock that they can see the chemical levels and  
**[0:11:39-0:11:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:11:39):**  some of the reports out there.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:11:40):**  What makes you say we have less than 100 years as a species?  
**[0:11:44-0:11:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:11:44):**  Yeah, there's two important phenomenon happening in human health right now to conspire to extinction.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:11:50):**  And the extinction of humans is just symptomatic of a deeper extinction event of planet Earth  
**[0:11:54-0:11:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:11:54):**  itself.  
**[0:11:56-0:11:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:11:56):**  The Earth has been through five great extinction events in the past.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:11:59):**  And this is now going to start to get us into how did I find myself in soil.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:12:04):**  When you start to study the previous extinction events, the last one being the easiest to  
**[0:12:08-0:12:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:12:08):**  refer to here, which was 55 million years ago, there was seemingly an asteroid that  
**[0:12:12-0:12:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:12:12):**  hit the surface of the planet.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:12:13):**  And in that asteroid percussion on the surface of the Earth, there was a huge cloud of small  
**[0:12:19-0:12:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:12:19):**  particle debris that was airborne at that moment and then settled on our top soils around  
**[0:12:23-0:12:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:12:23):**  the world and choked out creating an anaerobic event.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:12:26):**  And we lost topsoil over a course of a few years, maybe a decade, something like that.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:12:31):**  We had this complete collapse of the ecosystem.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:12:35):**  And it was short enough lived because it was a single hit that we lost about 85-87% of  
**[0:12:40-0:12:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:12:40):**  life on Earth.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:12:41):**  And then it launched into a massive, beautiful recovery, which we could go into later as  
**[0:12:45-0:12:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:12:45):**  we start to think about the regenerative capacity of nature.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:12:48):**  And first, it's important to realize that the collapse of soil, if it's short lived,  
**[0:12:54-0:12:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:12:54):**  will preserve the oceans.  
**[0:12:55-0:13:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:12:55):**  And so if the oceans don't acidify, you'll lose somewhere around 85-87%.  
**[0:13:01-0:13:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:13:01):**  Of the four other great extinctions that preceded the last one, there was two of them that were  
**[0:13:05-0:13:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:13:05):**  severe enough collapses of the soil architecture in this relationship with soil and air that  
**[0:13:10-0:13:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:13:10):**  the oceans acidified.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:13:12):**  And when the oceans acidify, as much as the soil is damaged, then we see about 95-97%  
**[0:13:17-0:13:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:13:17):**  of life on Earth destroyed.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:13:19):**  And so this is now kind of getting us to this current moment where in 2005, we're starting  
**[0:13:24-0:13:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:13:24):**  to look at the collapse of the planet.  
**[0:13:25-0:13:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:13:25):**  We're starting to have to come to terms with the fact that we are seeing rapid acceleration  
**[0:13:30-0:13:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:13:30):**  of decline of ice pack and everything else that should take millions of years is suddenly  
**[0:13:34-0:13:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:13:34):**  taking decades.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:13:36):**  And so we're accelerating somehow these natural cycles of Earth and its warming and its cooling  
**[0:13:40-0:13:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:13:40):**  periods and all that.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:13:41):**  Somehow we're doing something to accelerate that.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:13:44):**  And more importantly, we're doing something to really screw up the air quality.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:13:47):**  We were starting to get huge amounts of carbon substrate in the air.  
**[0:13:51-0:13:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:13:51):**  That's not just CO2.  
**[0:13:52-0:13:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:13:52):**  I think CO2 and methane have gotten too much clay in some ways.  
**[0:13:56-0:13:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:13:56):**  A lot of air time.  
**[0:13:57-0:14:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:13:57):**  But small carbon particulate that can no longer be absorbed from the ground is probably a  
**[0:14:01-0:14:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:14:01):**  bigger problem for biologic health in some ways.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:14:04):**  And so we're failing to get carbon back into the soil systems.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:14:08):**  And of course, you know better than I did in 2005 that the death of the soil, the death  
**[0:14:14-0:14:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:14:14):**  of the microbiome and the fungi and the living, breathing life forms there is what set us  
**[0:14:19-0:14:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:14:19):**  up for this collapse of biology on Earth.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:14:22):**  When you lose that topsoil, you can no longer breathe as a planet.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:14:25):**  The entire respiratory cycle of the planet relies on soil carbon cycling.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:14:30):**  This whole concept of carbon sequestration that the US government has put out there is  
**[0:14:35-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:14:35):**  this big yes, gee, kind of, it's completely bogus in this concept.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:14:40):**  We're not never supposed to sequester carbon.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:14:42):**  We're supposed to cycle carbon.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:14:44):**  Carbon is literally the backbone of carbohydrates and fats that turn into the energy that we  
**[0:14:50-0:14:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:14:50):**  would produce in our cells.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:14:52):**  And so in a fascinating way, you can't have a single cell survive without carbon cycling  
**[0:14:57-0:15:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:14:57):**  through whether it be a bacteria or in a complex cells like ours, we rely on the little bacteria  
**[0:15:03-0:15:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:15:03):**  called mitochondria that live inside our cells.  
**[0:15:05-0:15:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:15:05):**  And these bacteria outside of our cells, mitochondria inside ourselves are in concert working to  
**[0:15:11-0:15:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:15:11):**  break down carbon back into an exchange of electrons where we can move oxygen and hydrogen  
**[0:15:17-0:15:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:15:17):**  on these carbon backbones.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:15:18):**  And so in that relationship of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, we create life.  
**[0:15:23-0:15:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:15:23):**  And when you start to sequester carbon in the atmosphere because the planet can no longer  
**[0:15:27-0:15:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:15:27):**  breathe it in, or you start to sequester it in giant tanks because you've paid engineers  
**[0:15:32-0:15:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:15:32):**  billions of dollars to pull it out of the atmosphere and store it, you are literally  
**[0:15:38-0:15:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:15:38):**  robbing the Earth of its vital potential life.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:15:40):**  Yeah.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:15:41):**  And life is disappearing.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:15:42):**  So that's a long story of how a physician finds himself feeling pretty worthless in  
**[0:15:48-0:15:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:15:48):**  this chronic disease epidemic that we're facing.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:15:51):**  And we get to this point where, and as a physician, you're sitting in an office and you're seeing  
**[0:15:56-0:16:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:15:56):**  patients all day long and the best you can do is lower their blood pressure a few points  
**[0:16:01-0:16:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:16:01):**  or lower their blood sugar a few points by putting more and more drugs.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:16:04):**  And they come back three months later, they look better.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:16:06):**  They come back in six, nine months, they look worse again.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:16:08):**  So you increase their meds, you change their meds up and they look better for a moment.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:16:12):**  And then they come back.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:16:13):**  By the time I'd been doing this for 10 years, it definitely felt like a dog and pony show  
**[0:16:17-0:16:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:16:17):**  or it's just smoking me ears like I am not making anybody better.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:16:21):**  In fact, the more drugs I put on, the worse these people get over time.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:16:26):**  And it was when one of my patients, a young woman who already had severe obesity, metabolic  
**[0:16:31-0:16:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:16:31):**  disorder, peripheral vascular disease and neuropathy by the time she's 18 years old,  
**[0:16:36-0:16:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:16:36):**  just committed suicide and that moment was a huge wake up call for me.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:16:41):**  And for those of you who are not physicians, it's hard to explain what it feels like when  
**[0:16:47-0:16:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:16:47):**  you're put in a position of responsibility for somebody else's health and then something  
**[0:16:52-0:16:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:16:52):**  like that happens.  
**[0:16:54-0:16:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:16:54):**  And suicide has this very intense side of it.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:16:58):**  It's not like somebody died of a stroke.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:17:00):**  It's not the same experience where when you've developed a relationship with somebody over  
**[0:17:03-0:17:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:17:03):**  years of care and you know their family and you know their dog and their dog's name and  
**[0:17:08-0:17:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:17:08):**  you see their family pictures because they want to show you that and you become part  
**[0:17:13-0:17:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:17:13):**  of this person's life and you feel this sense of responsibility to see what's coming down  
**[0:17:18-0:17:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:17:18):**  the pike.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:17:19):**  And I didn't have the wherewithal to see this depression sneaking into her life.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:17:23):**  We talked about depression.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:17:24):**  I had her on antidepressants, but I never really got at the root cause of that thing  
**[0:17:28-0:17:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:17:28):**  and she ends up dying from suicide.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:17:30):**  And that moment was definitely one of the many slaps in the face that happened to me  
**[0:17:35-0:17:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:17:35):**  between kind of 2005 and 2010 that started to make me realize I was not equipped to deal  
**[0:17:42-0:17:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:17:42):**  with this problem.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:17:43):**  I was a finger in the dike of this explosion of chronic disease happening and I was getting  
**[0:17:48-0:17:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:17:48):**  more and more desperate for some sort of solution for my patients.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:17:51):**  And so in that journey, I happened to be doing chemotherapy research at that point in 2005.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:17:58):**  My endocrine research had taken me into tumor management of endocrine organs, the pituitary  
**[0:18:04-0:18:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:18:04):**  gland based the brain and these tumors didn't have good chemotherapy options for them.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:18:10):**  And so I started to develop a unique vitamin A compound approach to killing cancer cells  
**[0:18:16-0:18:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:18:16):**  through something called apoptosis or programmed cell suicide.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:18:19):**  And so here I'm watching on the microscope the effort to turn on the cell suicide in  
**[0:18:24-0:18:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:18:24):**  cells realizing that if a cell realized it was not part of the greater good, when a cell  
**[0:18:30-0:18:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:18:30):**  realizes that it's too damaged to repair itself and commit suicide.  
**[0:18:34-0:18:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:18:34):**  And for me to see this young girl at 18 commit suicide in the midst of my research understanding  
**[0:18:39-0:18:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:18:39):**  that a cell knows when it's no longer, it's doing more harm than good and it will kill  
**[0:18:44-0:18:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:18:44):**  itself, I was terrified to think that this woman felt that, that this young woman at  
**[0:18:49-0:18:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:18:49):**  18 years of age, her whole life ahead of her, had so much chronic disorder and disease in  
**[0:18:54-0:18:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:18:54):**  her life and she's watching her mother 20 years older get amputated below the knee because  
**[0:18:59-0:19:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:18:59):**  of her severe peripheral vascular disease and diabetes and all of this neuropathy that  
**[0:19:04-0:19:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:19:04):**  this girl at 18 is already starting to suffer from.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:19:07):**  She's so hopeless that she can participate in a positive way of humanity that she eliminates  
**[0:19:11-0:19:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:19:11):**  herself from the situation just as if one of my cancer cells comes into the realization  
**[0:19:16-0:19:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:19:16):**  of what it is and realizes it needs to die to be replaced by healthy tissue.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:19:21):**  It's an intense thing to think that our children may be getting to the point where they realize  
**[0:19:26-0:19:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:19:26):**  that humanity is functioning as a cancer on the planet and humanity is sucking the life  
**[0:19:31-0:19:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:19:31):**  out of this planet in the same way that a cancer cell and its damage does.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:19:36):**  And I think that this rash of suicides we're having in young people over the last couple  
**[0:19:42-0:19:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:19:42):**  of years and especially the amount of narcotic overdose and opioid addiction that we're seeing  
**[0:19:48-0:19:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:19:48):**  in these children are speaking to the reality that at the biological level, we have fundamentally  
**[0:19:53-0:19:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:19:53):**  disconnected ourselves from the reality that we were born into, which is nature.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:19:59):**  And so this is setting us up for that tough question of like where is our extinction event  
**[0:20:04-0:20:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:20:04):**  heading and this is again a long answer and I'm famous for lack of brevity.  
**[0:20:10-0:20:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:20:10):**  But as we start to look at this accumulation of damage and disconnect from our natural  
**[0:20:15-0:20:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:20:15):**  capacity for life, we can start to chart this out of the public health level and see the  
**[0:20:20-0:20:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:20:20):**  decline.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:20:21):**  On the planetary level, we're seeing the extinction of one species every 20 minutes.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:20:26):**  We've had a 10,000 fold increase in the extinction rate over the last 40-50 years and this is  
**[0:20:33-0:20:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:20:33):**  from the microbiome of the soils to microorganisms and small life within the oceans to large  
**[0:20:39-0:20:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:20:39):**  life within the oceans.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:20:40):**  Some estimates are now that we're at 92% extinction rate in our oceans already and so we're getting  
**[0:20:46-0:20:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:20:46):**  to this point of just catastrophic collapse around us and the human side of that is showing  
**[0:20:51-0:20:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:20:51):**  us this chronic disease epidemic in children coupled with the phenomenon of infertility.  
**[0:20:57-0:20:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:20:57):**  And so while chronic disease will certainly...  
**[0:20:59-0:21:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:20:59):**  And those are the two that gets you say we have less than 100 years.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:21:03):**  That's where you get it.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:21:04):**  Which in some cases, if you look at all the huge collapses that are happening, it sounds  
**[0:21:09-0:21:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:21:09):**  even like a lot, obviously it doesn't sound like a lot because it's only 100 years, but  
**[0:21:12-0:21:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:21:12):**  it also sounds like a lot if you look at what is collapsing around us.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:21:17):**  But still I'm seeing, okay, how did you get to nutrient density, to food, to soil?  
**[0:21:23-0:21:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:21:23):**  Because I know many other people probably around the world, many other doctors are seeing  
**[0:21:27-0:21:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:21:27):**  basically as an engineer, they're just between brackets, tweaking the medicine, seeing a  
**[0:21:32-0:21:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:21:32):**  patient nine months later, some patients, they might be losing some patients or not,  
**[0:21:36-0:21:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:21:36):**  but not many and actually very few end up going that deep into soil microbiome and really  
**[0:21:44-0:21:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:21:44):**  going deep into where health comes from and where life comes from.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:21:47):**  So there are some steps there that we haven't covered yet.  
**[0:21:50-0:21:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:21:50):**  It was a slippery slope for me.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:21:52):**  I mean, I was very fortunate to be doing the research I was doing.  
**[0:21:55-0:22:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:21:55):**  So this vitamin A compound that was killing cancer cells more effectively than a lot of  
**[0:22:01-0:22:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:22:01):**  chemotherapies out there was interesting to work with because after a few years of working  
**[0:22:06-0:22:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:22:06):**  with it, I came to realize that that comes naturally in a carrot, you know?  
**[0:22:10-0:22:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:22:10):**  And it took me years of studying this vitamin A compound before I made that connection,  
**[0:22:14-0:22:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:22:14):**  which just shows you how divorced my 17 years in academic medicine was from the concept  
**[0:22:19-0:22:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:22:19):**  of nutrition.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:22:20):**  But eventually came to realize, wait, this is in food and so that's interesting.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:22:24):**  I wonder, you know, if that's part of the piece of the puzzle.  
**[0:22:28-0:22:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:22:28):**  And it was actually a really intense night with one of my patients in one of my first  
**[0:22:32-0:22:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:22:32):**  clinical trials.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:22:33):**  And she got approval and went through multiple years of getting this vitamin A compound into  
**[0:22:38-0:22:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:22:38):**  an initial clinical trial.  
**[0:22:40-0:22:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:22:40):**  But not in the form of a carrot, I think.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:22:42):**  Not in the form of a carrot.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:22:43):**  Yeah, it was a fancy pharmaceuticalized, chemicalized version of a carrot.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:22:48):**  And so I had this drug and I sat with this patient and I spent 45 minutes trying to convince  
**[0:22:54-0:22:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:22:54):**  this woman to take this capsule, these six capsules in her hand.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:22:58):**  Every fiber in her body was telling her not to do this.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:23:01):**  And I spent 45 minutes breaking her down with a combination of fear and guilt and this patriarchal  
**[0:23:07-0:23:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:23:07):**  hubris that I knew better and I knew her tumor.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:23:10):**  And without this, I'm the doctor, I've got 17 years of science and blah, blah, blah.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:23:16):**  Finally she took these and I couldn't figure out why I felt so dark for the next couple  
**[0:23:21-0:23:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:23:21):**  days after that experience because it seemed like a success here.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:23:24):**  I had my first patient enrolled in the clinical trial, the novel chemotherapy.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:23:28):**  Like this was, I was supposed to be winning the game right now.  
**[0:23:31-0:23:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:23:31):**  Like I should have been at this pinnacle of exuberance and instead I just felt depressed.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:23:36):**  And it's taken me years and years to, well over a decade to figure out that piece of  
**[0:23:40-0:23:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:23:40):**  the puzzle which was at that moment as a physician, I broke the spirit of a human being and she  
**[0:23:47-0:23:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:23:47):**  ended up doing something that at this deep body-soul level she wasn't supposed to do.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:23:52):**  That chemotherapy went on to be totally fine for her.  
**[0:23:54-0:23:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:23:54):**  She didn't have any negative side effects or anything like that.  
**[0:23:57-0:23:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:23:57):**  It didn't seem to do any harm.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:23:59):**  But the harm had been done through my lack of respect for her and my lack of willingness  
**[0:24:03-0:24:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:24:03):**  to let her follow her own intuition and I broke her spirit through a combination of  
**[0:24:08-0:24:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:24:08):**  fear and guilt.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:24:09):**  So that was the worst I had ever been as a physician and it was a slow realization of  
**[0:24:15-0:24:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:24:15):**  that.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:24:16):**  Combined with some tough questions she'd asked me in those 45 minutes about the nature of  
**[0:24:20-0:24:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:24:20):**  this chemotherapy and how I came to believe that it would heal her.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:24:24):**  And what it really revealed was that in no point in human history had cancer been caused  
**[0:24:30-0:24:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:24:30):**  by a lack of chemotherapy.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:24:33):**  And that was suddenly this daunting realization of my God, no matter how good I get, no matter  
**[0:24:38-0:24:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:24:38):**  how good my drugs get, I'm never going to solve this epidemic of cancer because I'm  
**[0:24:42-0:24:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:24:42):**  in the wrong space.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:24:44):**  And so as I started to see this complete collapse happen of my whole system at that point, as  
**[0:24:49-0:24:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:24:49):**  soon as you start to ask those kind of questions, you realize there's no pharmaceutical drug  
**[0:24:52-0:24:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:24:52):**  that's going to solve the problem.  
**[0:24:55-0:25:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:24:55):**  And so I had $200,000 of school debt and 17 years invested and I put my family through  
**[0:25:00-0:25:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:25:00):**  just tough years of working 120 hours a week in the hospital and they had young kids and  
**[0:25:06-0:25:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:25:06):**  I had put my family through it and I put us in a huge debt and I was depressed and didn't  
**[0:25:11-0:25:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:25:11):**  know what my direction was.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:25:13):**  But that vitamin A saved me.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:25:15):**  I kept thinking about that like that carrot, why does the carrot have that in it?  
**[0:25:21-0:25:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:25:21):**  And so I started studying nutrition and in 2008 I dug into a bunch of books.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:25:25):**  One of them was Neil Barnard's program for reversing diabetes.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:25:28):**  I had been trained in the third best endocrine program in the world, the largest endocrine  
**[0:25:33-0:25:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:25:33):**  faculty in the world in our division.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:25:35):**  Like I was pinnacle and nobody had told me that you could reverse diabetes.  
**[0:25:40-0:25:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:25:40):**  I was just like, what is this doctor saying to reverse it?  
**[0:25:43-0:25:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:25:43):**  How many hours do you think you would have spent on let's say food and nutrition in your  
**[0:25:48-0:25:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:25:48):**  studies?  
**[0:25:49-0:25:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:25:49):**  There's only one course taught on food and nutrition is taught in your first semester  
**[0:25:53-0:25:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:25:53):**  of medical school, which by the time 10 years later you're a practicing physician, you have  
**[0:25:56-0:25:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:25:56):**  no memory of.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:25:58):**  And looking back into those nutrition textbooks that I was taught for that one semester, it  
**[0:26:03-0:26:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:26:03):**  was completely bogus.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:26:05):**  There's not a single mention of nutrients, there's not a single mention of soil, there's  
**[0:26:08-0:26:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:26:08):**  not a single mention of minerals.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:26:10):**  And it's still the case?  
**[0:26:12-0:26:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:26:12):**  Still the case.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:26:13):**  You're taught about carbohydrates, protein and fat.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:26:17):**  That's it.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:26:18):**  That's the whole paradigm you're handed.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:26:20):**  And you're taught about calories.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:26:22):**  Calories are causing the collapse of human health.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:26:24):**  We're eating too many calories, which is completely bogus obviously.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:26:27):**  Our athletes eat 9,000 calories a day and they're the leanest, best biologic specimens  
**[0:26:31-0:26:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:26:31):**  on the planet.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:26:32):**  If calories caused obesity and killed people, they would not be performing well.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:26:36):**  So we just have completely the wrong lens on this thing, nutrition.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:26:41):**  So in some ways it's less about not enough nutrition.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:26:45):**  Thank God they only teach that for three months because it's so wrong.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:26:48):**  That's a good point.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:26:49):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:26:50):**  Imagine if they were teaching all the years.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:26:52):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:53-0:26:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:26:53):**  If they just drilled that into us harder, we'd be impossible to remodel.  
**[0:26:56-0:27:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:26:56):**  But in the end, this realization took me to 2010 where the whole university was in freefall  
**[0:27:02-0:27:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:27:02):**  as was academia in that area of the recession.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:27:05):**  So 2008 brought about a huge collapse.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:27:08):**  By 2010, the NIH, our National Institutes of Health had made radical cuts on research  
**[0:27:13-0:27:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:27:13):**  and all of this.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:27:14):**  And in 2010, the University of Virginia where I had all my clinical research at lost our  
**[0:27:17-0:27:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:27:17):**  funding from the NIH for our General Clinical Research Center that had been funded since  
**[0:27:21-0:27:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:27:21):**  1969 just to give you a sense of just how bad that recession was on research.  
**[0:27:26-0:27:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:27:26):**  And so suddenly our division was in complete collapse and I needed to find a way out.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:27:31):**  And I started interviewing at other big universities and all this and just had this deep sense  
**[0:27:37-0:27:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:27:37):**  of it's just going to be more of the same.  
**[0:27:40-0:27:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:27:40):**  So I just started calling out to literally God, universe, nature, whatever I could think  
**[0:27:45-0:27:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:27:45):**  of just saying, show me my next path, show me my next path.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:27:48):**  And through that, a huge moment of visioning or downloading, however you want to call it  
**[0:27:54-0:27:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:27:54):**  happened to me while I was in my lab one day and just drew out all these Venn diagrams,  
**[0:27:58-0:28:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:27:58):**  all these companies and investment strategies and everything else that could be used to  
**[0:28:01-0:28:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:28:01):**  change academia and extract us from the pharmaceutical model and all this.  
**[0:28:05-0:28:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:28:05):**  And I didn't know how to deal with that.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:28:07):**  I had never started a company.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:28:08):**  I had no idea on how to start a company at the time.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:28:10):**  And so it was overwhelming and daunting.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:28:13):**  But as I went through the next few weeks, all the doors started to slam.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:28:17):**  And I think when the world wants you to go a different direction, it makes damn sure  
**[0:28:20-0:28:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:28:20):**  you go a different direction.  
**[0:28:21-0:28:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:28:21):**  And in this case, I had a complete deconstruction of my life from the next six months.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:28:26):**  And finally in the end, I had one path to follow and that was to this massive diagram  
**[0:28:32-0:28:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:28:32):**  of all these clinics and everything else.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:28:34):**  And a friend of mine's dad was in town and I had mentioned to her that I didn't have  
**[0:28:39-0:28:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:28:39):**  any idea on how to start businesses.  
**[0:28:40-0:28:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:28:40):**  She said, well, my dad's in town.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:28:42):**  He's a consultant to small businesses and startups and I help you.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:28:45):**  So this guy kindly listened to me for four hours and then said, all you have to do is  
**[0:28:48-0:28:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:28:48):**  start this one little thing down here, which is I think you said a one little clinic.  
**[0:28:52-0:28:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:28:52):**  Go start that, do that well and maybe all of this other stuff will happen.  
**[0:28:55-0:28:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:28:55):**  And so that's what I did.  
**[0:28:56-0:29:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:28:56):**  In 2010, I left the university and went to rural Virginia into a food desert there, which  
**[0:29:01-0:29:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:29:01):**  was in the end, the only place that I felt confident enough to teach nutrition was a  
**[0:29:05-0:29:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:29:05):**  place where there was no grocery store and everybody was eating out of gas stations.  
**[0:29:08-0:29:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:29:08):**  I figured I could do better than a Twinkie.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:29:11):**  And that was pretty much my level of confidence.  
**[0:29:13-0:29:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:29:13):**  I set the bar very low.  
**[0:29:15-0:29:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:29:15):**  Yeah.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:29:16):**  Yeah, I had to set it low because I did not know what I was talking about.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:29:19):**  And so I just started teaching nutrition and I started studying the hell out of it.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:29:23):**  And it turned out that my biochemistry background, cell biology, pharmaceutical background became  
**[0:29:28-0:29:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:29:28):**  incredibly helpful because in 2012 when we were studying kale and its failure to make  
**[0:29:34-0:29:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:29:34):**  my patients better.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:29:35):**  This superfood.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:29:36):**  Yeah.  
**[0:29:37-0:29:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:29:37):**  So it's interesting because kale is being like, please put it in every smoothie, et  
**[0:29:41-0:29:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:29:41):**  cetera, et cetera, because it's going to do magic.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:29:43):**  And you found that it wasn't doing its magic.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:29:46):**  It wasn't doing magic.  
**[0:29:49-0:29:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:29:49):**  It wasn't doing magic.  
**[0:29:50-0:29:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:29:50):**  In fact, it was making my patients worse in a lot of cases.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:29:52):**  I was having patients increase their inflammation markers as I increased the amount of kale  
**[0:29:57-0:29:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:29:57):**  in their life.  
**[0:29:58-0:30:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:29:58):**  And it took me a couple of years of seeing that phenomenon happen before I really realized  
**[0:30:02-0:30:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:30:02):**  that maybe it really is the kale.  
**[0:30:03-0:30:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:30:03):**  Like is it possible that superfoods are actually becoming toxins somehow?  
**[0:30:08-0:30:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:30:08):**  Which gets us back to that interesting shift in the planet.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:30:10):**  Like when does the planet become intolerable or unable to support life?  
**[0:30:15-0:30:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:30:15):**  If our superfoods are failing us, what does that mean?  
**[0:30:17-0:30:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:30:17):**  And so that's actually the moment that we started looking into soil science and my colleague  
**[0:30:22-0:30:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:30:22):**  William Vitalis brought in a 90-page white paper on soil science and I was blown away  
**[0:30:26-0:30:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:30:26):**  that anybody knew anything on dirt that would fill 90 pages of a white paper.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:30:32):**  And so I started diving into soil for the first time in 2012 and in that first few minutes  
**[0:30:37-0:30:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:30:37):**  of looking at that white paper, William shows me this molecule and he said like, this is  
**[0:30:42-0:30:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:30:42):**  important one for soil because of, I can't remember what he said, but I'm sitting there  
**[0:30:46-0:30:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:30:46):**  looking at that thing and blown away because that molecule on the right side of it looked  
**[0:30:51-0:30:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:30:51):**  like the chemotherapy I used to make.  
**[0:30:53-0:30:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:30:53):**  And I had gotten to the point in my mind where I understood medicine could come out of food,  
**[0:30:58-0:31:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:30:58):**  but I had no inkling that medicine could be as deep as the soil.  
**[0:31:02-0:31:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:31:02):**  And so that was the moment we started a biotech company and we started doing soil extraction  
**[0:31:06-0:31:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:31:06):**  to understand what kind of medicines within the soil itself.  
**[0:31:09-0:31:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:31:09):**  And of course these molecules were carbon backbone oxygen-hydrogen carriers that we  
**[0:31:13-0:31:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:31:13):**  call redox molecules.  
**[0:31:15-0:31:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:31:15):**  And so that was my excitement, that was my big shift and that's why I've become so profoundly  
**[0:31:20-0:31:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:31:20):**  excited about the microbiome because it turns out it's the bacteria and fungi within soil  
**[0:31:24-0:31:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:31:24):**  that makes this medicine.  
**[0:31:25-0:31:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:31:25):**  And so the idea that the microbiome was making medicine within our soils and ultimately within  
**[0:31:30-0:31:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:31:30):**  the soil of our gut closed the loop on a bunch of science that was emerging between 2008  
**[0:31:35-0:31:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:31:35):**  and 2012 because of genomics, we were starting to be able to sequence the genome of the human  
**[0:31:40-0:31:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:31:40):**  gut.  
**[0:31:41-0:31:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:31:41):**  What does it mean when somebody says that, like we were able to sequence the genome?  
**[0:31:45-0:31:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:31:45):**  What does that in layman's terms actually mean?  
**[0:31:48-0:31:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:31:48):**  The amount of bacteria in a human being is so astronomical.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:31:52):**  You're looking at 1.4 quadrillion bacteria and at least 30,000.  
**[0:31:57-0:31:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:31:57):**  We're more bacteria than ourselves.  
**[0:31:58-0:32:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:31:58):**  I mean, we're a carrier of bacteria.  
**[0:32:00-0:32:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:32:00):**  We're more of us basically.  
**[0:32:01-0:32:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:32:01):**  And then even more daunting than that is there's 10x more than the bacteria of mitochondria,  
**[0:32:07-0:32:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:32:07):**  which are also bacteria that live inside ourselves.  
**[0:32:10-0:32:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:32:10):**  And so you really outnumbered a hundred to one, if not a thousand to one by these other  
**[0:32:16-0:32:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:32:16):**  creatures that are around you and within you.  
**[0:32:19-0:32:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:32:19):**  And so that was a, we were starting to come to terms with the scale of that, but we had  
**[0:32:22-0:32:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:32:22):**  no idea how we were going to ever categorize all that until our genome sequencers evolved  
**[0:32:27-0:32:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:32:27):**  to the point where we could take that massive population and sequence the entire genome  
**[0:32:32-0:32:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:32:32):**  of that.  
**[0:32:33-0:32:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:32:33):**  Sequence basically means mapping, mapping your gut microbiome.  
**[0:32:37-0:32:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:32:37):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:32:38-0:32:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:32:38):**  And so you're, when we say sequencing, you're figuring out the sequence of amino acids that  
**[0:32:42-0:32:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:32:42):**  will line up for a protein are patterned off of nucleic acids of DNA.  
**[0:32:47-0:32:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:32:47):**  And so when you start to map that sequence of DNA, you're starting to see the linear  
**[0:32:52-0:32:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:32:52):**  patterns there.  
**[0:32:53-0:32:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:32:53):**  You can start to cipher species and more importantly, their behavior.  
**[0:32:57-0:33:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:32:57):**  And so with the advent of epigenetics and now micro RNA, we can actually start to understand  
**[0:33:03-0:33:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:33:03):**  not only what species are there, but which species are active and which species are stressed  
**[0:33:07-0:33:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:33:07):**  or which species are turning on which genes.  
**[0:33:09-0:33:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:33:09):**  And so that started to allow us to see some amazing things that we had never even imagined  
**[0:33:14-0:33:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:33:14):**  about cancer, which was that when you have a shift in the loss of bacteria in the soil  
**[0:33:18-0:33:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:33:18):**  system, you get this cancer in the organism.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:33:22):**  That seemed impossible.  
**[0:33:24-0:33:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:33:24):**  How can the bacteria in your gut predict which cancer you get?  
**[0:33:27-0:33:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:33:27):**  In fact, that was exactly what's happening.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:33:28):**  You miss these bacteria, you get breast cancer.  
**[0:33:30-0:33:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:33:30):**  You miss these, you get prostate cancer.  
**[0:33:32-0:33:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:33:32):**  You miss these bacteria, you get lung cancer.  
**[0:33:35-0:33:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:33:35):**  That was just didn't make any sense.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:33:37):**  And in my lab group at the University of Virginia where I was making chemotherapy, we used to  
**[0:33:40-0:33:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:33:40):**  joke about this because the studies were coming out of UCLA and all this.  
**[0:33:44-0:33:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:33:44):**  So it was like hippies in California thought this, but all of us on the East Coast Ivy  
**[0:33:48-0:33:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:33:48):**  League schools, we were serious.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:33:50):**  We knew that it was not about bacteria.  
**[0:33:52-0:33:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:33:52):**  We knew it was genetic sequencing and mTOR and all these crazy intracellular human pathways.  
**[0:33:58-0:34:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:33:58):**  But certainly bacteria had nothing to do with cancer.  
**[0:34:01-0:34:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:34:01):**  By the time 2014 rolled around, it was just, you know, it's just stupid obvious now that  
**[0:34:06-0:34:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:34:06):**  we were completely wrong about our entire cancer model and it's entirely about the soil  
**[0:34:10-0:34:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:34:10):**  system and that soil system predicting health or disease in the individual now has been  
**[0:34:14-0:34:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:34:14):**  mapped back to everything that's gone epidemic, autoimmune disease, obesity, diabetes, all  
**[0:34:19-0:34:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:34:19):**  of it maps back to the gut microbiome and damage to it as the initial pathology, the  
**[0:34:23-0:34:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:34:23):**  initial physiologic.  
**[0:34:25-0:34:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:34:25):**  So the question is why?  
**[0:34:26-0:34:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:34:26):**  Because we have been, I mean, some are saying, let's say since the invention of agriculture,  
**[0:34:31-0:34:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:34:31):**  which obviously wasn't an invention, it was a gradual transition.  
**[0:34:34-0:34:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:34:34):**  We've been farming in many cases, not regeneratively.  
**[0:34:37-0:34:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:34:37):**  We've been farming extractively, some cases slower, some places faster, some cases actually  
**[0:34:42-0:34:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:34:42):**  relatively regeneratively, but it has been small pockets of exceptions, especially indigenous  
**[0:34:47-0:34:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:34:47):**  peoples have been able to manage landscapes in a very different way.  
**[0:34:50-0:34:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:34:50):**  But on a broader scale, we've been mining soil, but we've never had these huge spikes  
**[0:34:56-0:35:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:34:56):**  like you were saying in the late nineties and the two thousands.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:35:00):**  So what has changed for anybody that knows your work?  
**[0:35:02-0:35:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:35:02):**  I'm asking very obvious question, but for anybody that doesn't, what has changed since  
**[0:35:06-0:35:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:35:06):**  then?  
**[0:35:07-0:35:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:35:07):**  What changed over the last now 2020, let's say 25, 30 years.  
**[0:35:11-0:35:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:35:11):**  Yeah, that was the question we started to ask ourselves.  
**[0:35:13-0:35:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:35:13):**  I didn't know in 2012, but I understood that it looked like our soil systems were collapsing,  
**[0:35:18-0:35:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:35:18):**  but I didn't know anything about why.  
**[0:35:20-0:35:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:35:20):**  And it was my chief science advisor, John Gilday, a PhD out of Johns Hopkins geneticist  
**[0:35:25-0:35:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:35:25):**  and incredible cell biologists who first did the thought experiment.  
**[0:35:30-0:35:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:35:30):**  He actually got the flu and the first time in years he was laid up in bed with a high  
**[0:35:35-0:35:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:35:35):**  fever and all he did during that four days in bed was read that 90 page white paper that  
**[0:35:40-0:35:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:35:40):**  I'd given him.  
**[0:35:41-0:35:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:35:41):**  And at the end of that, he called me on Monday and said, Zach, I think what we actually have  
**[0:35:47-0:35:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:35:47):**  here is something much different than we thought.  
**[0:35:49-0:35:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:35:49):**  I think that we actually have the antidote to Roundup.  
**[0:35:52-0:35:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:35:52):**  And as a pharmaceutical guy, I was like Roundup, like it took me a couple of seconds to even  
**[0:35:58-0:36:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:35:58):**  place that word in my lexicon.  
**[0:36:00-0:36:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:36:00):**  I was like, isn't that like a weed killer?  
**[0:36:02-0:36:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:36:02):**  You know?  
**[0:36:03-0:36:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:36:03):**  He's like, yeah, and it's in our food and it's in our water and there's some data coming  
**[0:36:06-0:36:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:36:06):**  out that it can damage some of their systems.  
**[0:36:09-0:36:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:36:09):**  And we'd been using this compound now.  
**[0:36:11-0:36:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:36:11):**  We had figured out how to extract it from soil and we were using these compounds in  
**[0:36:15-0:36:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:36:15):**  our clinic and seeing unbelievable results.  
**[0:36:17-0:36:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:36:17):**  I was thinking of it as a cancer treatment, but we were seeing things that had nothing  
**[0:36:21-0:36:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:36:21):**  to do with cancer change.  
**[0:36:22-0:36:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:36:22):**  We were seeing things like autoimmune disease and just inflammation itself.  
**[0:36:25-0:36:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:36:25):**  And it didn't seem like an anti-inflammatory.  
**[0:36:28-0:36:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:36:28):**  And I couldn't figure out why it was doing any of the things it was doing.  
**[0:36:31-0:36:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:36:31):**  And so John was the first one to come up with this thought experiment where he said, I think  
**[0:36:35-0:36:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:36:35):**  that this is actually changing the chemistry and biochemistry around bifosate and which  
**[0:36:39-0:36:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:36:39):**  is the active ingredient in Roundup.  
**[0:36:41-0:36:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:36:41):**  And so that was the moment we started shifting to this compound.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:36:45):**  And in the first few months I was just thinking it as a pure toxin and it was unbelievable  
**[0:36:49-0:36:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:36:49):**  what this thing did to our cells.  
**[0:36:50-0:36:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:36:50):**  Like we were studying in human cells of different types and kidney tubules and gut cells and  
**[0:36:55-0:36:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:36:55):**  it just destroys them.  
**[0:36:56-0:36:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:36:56):**  It's an unbelievable toxin.  
**[0:36:58-0:36:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:36:58):**  And so I was in this mindset.  
**[0:36:59-0:37:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:36:59):**  Which is why farmers loved and loved them so much because it just kills.  
**[0:37:04-0:37:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:37:04):**  And just Roundup is the brand name and glyphosate is the ingredient, which now also actually  
**[0:37:09-0:37:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:37:09):**  you can buy and you don't only have to buy Roundup, you can actually buy them in many  
**[0:37:12-0:37:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:37:12):**  other forms and shapes.  
**[0:37:13-0:37:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:37:13):**  Yeah.  
**[0:37:14-0:37:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:37:14):**  You just saw what it did to human tissue and to non-human tissue.  
**[0:37:18-0:37:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:37:18):**  It doesn't only kill weeds.  
**[0:37:19-0:37:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:37:19):**  I think that's a very understatement claim.  
**[0:37:22-0:37:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:37:22):**  Yeah.  
**[0:37:23-0:37:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:37:23):**  It's an understatement of the URI for sure.  
**[0:37:24-0:37:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:37:24):**  But it's interesting, you know, the deeper you go on that chemical, you know, thinking  
**[0:37:28-0:37:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:37:28):**  of it as a toxin was bad.  
**[0:37:30-0:37:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:37:30):**  I was like, oh my gosh.  
**[0:37:31-0:37:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:37:31):**  And it turned out that John was right.  
**[0:37:32-0:37:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:37:32):**  This soil compound acts as an antidote to that damaged cell.  
**[0:37:37-0:37:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:37:37):**  So then the question is, you know, but we're seeing this human disease accelerate in this  
**[0:37:41-0:37:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:37:41):**  short 20, 30 year period.  
**[0:37:43-0:37:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:37:43):**  And Roundup certainly got introduced at the beginning of that journey into this chronic  
**[0:37:47-0:37:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:37:47):**  disease epidemic.  
**[0:37:48-0:37:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:37:48):**  But there doesn't seem to be enough of the toxin in the water and food systems to directly  
**[0:37:53-0:37:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:37:53):**  cause all of that disease.  
**[0:37:54-0:37:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:37:54):**  But I had already come to the conclusion that the microbiome was predicting disease.  
**[0:37:58-0:38:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:37:58):**  You didn't need a direct toxin.  
**[0:38:00-0:38:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:38:00):**  And it turns out that I saw just like, I don't even remember how I saw it, something online.  
**[0:38:06-0:38:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:38:06):**  I was not on social media at the time.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:38:07):**  I don't even know if we had Instagram in 2013.  
**[0:38:10-0:38:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:38:10):**  I don't think we did.  
**[0:38:11-0:38:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:38:11):**  But this little blurb came up about an antibiotic function of Roundup.  
**[0:38:15-0:38:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:38:15):**  And I was like, wait, hold on.  
**[0:38:17-0:38:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:38:17):**  What?  
**[0:38:18-0:38:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:38:18):**  Nobody's ever told me that.  
**[0:38:19-0:38:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:38:19):**  And looking into that, I suddenly realized this is the smoking gun.  
**[0:38:23-0:38:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:38:23):**  Yes, it has toxic effects directly on human cells and is predicting cancer and other diseases  
**[0:38:29-0:38:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:38:29):**  through that mechanism.  
**[0:38:31-0:38:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:38:31):**  But how much more harmful would it be if it actually had functioned first as an antibiotic  
**[0:38:35-0:38:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:38:35):**  and destroyed the microbiome?  
**[0:38:37-0:38:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:38:37):**  And in the end, that's what our data now really points to is that we destroyed life on Earth  
**[0:38:41-0:38:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:38:41):**  the moment we put billions of pounds.  
**[0:38:44-0:38:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:38:44):**  And we currently spread four and a half to five billion pounds of this chemical globally  
**[0:38:48-0:38:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:38:48):**  every year.  
**[0:38:49-0:38:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:38:49):**  When we start pouring billions of pounds of an antibiotic into our soils, which are with  
**[0:38:54-0:38:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:38:54):**  a water soluble antibiotic that then will be picked up by the rainwater or irrigation  
**[0:38:59-0:39:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:38:59):**  systems and washed into our freshwater and down into our oceans.  
**[0:39:03-0:39:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:39:03):**  And during that path, it evaporates into the air we breathe and the rain that then falls.  
**[0:39:08-0:39:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:39:08):**  That antibiotic is now percolating through all ecosystems of the planet to destroy the  
**[0:39:13-0:39:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:39:13):**  fabric of Earth, which ultimately was built on the backs of the microbiome.  
**[0:39:18-0:39:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:39:18):**  And so this is why soil has become the most important topic for any investor, any CEO  
**[0:39:24-0:39:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:39:24):**  out there, any person, any person that wants to be alive, any mother who wants to have  
**[0:39:29-0:39:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:39:29):**  children, anybody on any track needs to come to terms with the fact that the most important  
**[0:39:36-0:39:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:39:36):**  thing that we need to do is rebuild a microbiome ecosystem on the planet.  
**[0:39:41-0:39:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:39:41):**  It is paramount to the survival of our species.  
**[0:39:43-0:39:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:39:43):**  It's paramount to the survival of the planet as we understand it and speed at which we're  
**[0:39:47-0:39:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:39:47):**  destroying that microbiome has never been seen in 55 million years.  
**[0:39:51-0:39:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:39:51):**  It's been that long since we've seen this level of devastation to the microbiome.  
**[0:39:55-0:39:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:39:55):**  And this time we are the cause.  
**[0:39:57-0:40:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:39:57):**  We are the cataclysmic event that's causing this and it's through our treatment of soil.  
**[0:40:02-0:40:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:40:02):**  And so it's just incredibly simple in the end.  
**[0:40:04-0:40:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:40:04):**  We don't have a chronic disease epidemic in the end.  
**[0:40:06-0:40:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:40:06):**  We have a soil death process happening in front of us.  
**[0:40:10-0:40:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:40:10):**  And if we don't see it that simply, we're going to miss it.  
**[0:40:12-0:40:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:40:12):**  If we keep chasing, running away from viruses as if they could be run away from, hiding  
**[0:40:18-0:40:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:40:18):**  in our houses as if we can hide from a virus.  
**[0:40:21-0:40:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:40:21):**  We are so backwards in our medicine and our public health response, our consumer understanding  
**[0:40:28-0:40:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:40:28):**  of viruses.  
**[0:40:29-0:40:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:40:29):**  Like we are just in the dark ages, literally, of the science that's out there today.  
**[0:40:33-0:40:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:40:33):**  We have 40 years of science proving that the microbiome and viruses are the reason we're  
**[0:40:38-0:40:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:40:38):**  here.  
**[0:40:39-0:40:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:40:39):**  We should not be spraying.  
**[0:40:41-0:40:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:40:41):**  I'm watching football players and baseball players, young healthy men being sprayed with  
**[0:40:46-0:40:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:40:46):**  chemicals before they can go into practice so that they're sterile.  
**[0:40:50-0:40:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:40:50):**  That is the stupidest thing we've ever done as humans.  
**[0:40:52-0:40:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:40:52):**  I'm seeing municipalities repurpose their fire trucks and all the way to like their  
**[0:40:58-0:41:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:40:58):**  snowmaking machines to spray chemicals into the air to kill viruses so that they can get  
**[0:41:03-0:41:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:41:03):**  back to work from pandemic.  
**[0:41:05-0:41:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:41:05):**  It is the stupidest thing that we could ever do is to think that we're going to like,  
**[0:41:10-0:41:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:41:10):**  war ourselves into with better and better chemical technology, sterilize the planet  
**[0:41:15-0:41:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:41:15):**  so humans can be here.  
**[0:41:17-0:41:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:41:17):**  We won't be here because of the sterility.  
**[0:41:21-0:41:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:41:21):**  We have to end this war on the microbiome.  
**[0:41:23-0:41:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:41:23):**  We have to end this catastrophic Holocaust on soil that we are currently perpetuating.  
**[0:41:31-0:41:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:41:31):**  And the ocean, I think.  
**[0:41:32-0:41:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:41:32):**  And I definitely, I will unpack the investor bit because you briefly mentioned that, but  
**[0:41:36-0:41:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:41:36):**  just to be clear, the smoking gun is round up in glyphosate.  
**[0:41:40-0:41:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:41:40):**  Is that the only one?  
**[0:41:41-0:41:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:41:41):**  We just got very unlucky because there's so many other chemicals we have been spraying,  
**[0:41:46-0:41:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:41:46):**  pumping, spreading on everything.  
**[0:41:49-0:41:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:41:49):**  Is there a cocktail of things?  
**[0:41:50-0:41:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:41:50):**  Is it mostly glyphosate?  
**[0:41:51-0:41:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:41:51):**  What have you seen?  
**[0:41:52-0:41:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:41:52):**  Like if we get glyphosate gun, for sure companies will come up with a lot of other very nicely  
**[0:41:57-0:42:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:41:57):**  sounding things that obviously don't harm us until we find out they do.  
**[0:42:01-0:42:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:42:01):**  Is it glyphosate or is there a whole, let's say, army cabinet full of smoking guns here?  
**[0:42:07-0:42:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:42:07):**  It's a great question.  
**[0:42:09-0:42:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:42:09):**  Yeah.  
**[0:42:10-0:42:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:42:10):**  And it's interesting when you look at the chemicals that existed at the time that glyphosate  
**[0:42:14-0:42:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:42:14):**  did viewed, our primary chemical we were spraying in the US was atrazine as a weed killer.  
**[0:42:20-0:42:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:42:20):**  And atrazine and the nicotinamides, second to those are profoundly carcinogenic, have  
**[0:42:26-0:42:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:42:26):**  horrible toxin capacity on everything from the brain to human cells of all types.  
**[0:42:32-0:42:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:42:32):**  And so you think, well, glyphosate actually came along to be the less toxic thing.  
**[0:42:36-0:42:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:42:36):**  So we're better than atrazine.  
**[0:42:38-0:42:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:42:38):**  The war to end all wars.  
**[0:42:39-0:42:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:42:39):**  Yeah.  
**[0:42:40-0:42:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:42:40):**  It's the war to end all wars.  
**[0:42:41-0:42:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:42:41):**  We were going to be safer and more effective and it was more effective.  
**[0:42:44-0:42:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:42:44):**  Roundup was way more effective than atrazine in killing weeds.  
**[0:42:47-0:42:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:42:47):**  And so it was this panacea of, oh, here's something that's not as toxic and works better.  
**[0:42:52-0:42:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:42:52):**  And so it just went crazy like, but it killed plants.  
**[0:42:55-0:42:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:42:55):**  And so you couldn't spray anything too close to the crops.  
**[0:42:58-0:43:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:42:58):**  You had to watch your concentrations and you had to be very careful with it.  
**[0:43:02-0:43:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:43:02):**  Until 1992, we realized, well, we could spray our wheat and legumes directly with this as  
**[0:43:07-0:43:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:43:07):**  a desiccant and dry it out faster to harvest quicker.  
**[0:43:11-0:43:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:43:11):**  And so we started spraying our food directly in 1991, 92.  
**[0:43:14-0:43:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:43:14):**  And then by 1996, of course, we had the debut of the GMO Roundup Ready crops.  
**[0:43:19-0:43:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:43:19):**  And so now we're spraying not only the crops that need to be killed right before harvest  
**[0:43:23-0:43:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:43:23):**  or dried, but now we're spraying everything.  
**[0:43:26-0:43:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:43:26):**  So it was corn, soybean, alfalfa, and the whole cascade.  
**[0:43:30-0:43:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:43:30):**  And so in that journey, we became addicted to this chemical.  
**[0:43:33-0:43:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:43:33):**  And so is it the worst one or is it really better than atrazine?  
**[0:43:36-0:43:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:43:36):**  As a small aside here, it's interesting to know that we have so much Roundup resistant  
**[0:43:40-0:43:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:43:40):**  weeds in the Midwest in the United States.  
**[0:43:42-0:43:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:43:42):**  The number one chemical growth sprayed in the United States today is atrazine.  
**[0:43:46-0:43:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:43:46):**  And so the 40 years of warfare failed completely and we're back to atrazine again, spraying  
**[0:43:51-0:43:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:43:51):**  our crops.  
**[0:43:52-0:43:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:43:52):**  So atrazine is worse than this.  
**[0:43:54-0:43:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:43:54):**  And certainly as a direct carcinogen, I would say atrazine is probably worse.  
**[0:43:57-0:44:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:43:57):**  2,4-D is the new one on that.  
**[0:44:00-0:44:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:44:00):**  That's really coming on hard.  
**[0:44:01-0:44:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:44:01):**  Dicamba, fortunately, just got banned in a number of locations and all that.  
**[0:44:07-0:44:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:44:07):**  But dicamba and 2,4-D are a direct relationship to Agent Orange, which so is, like I say,  
**[0:44:12-0:44:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:44:12):**  they're all organophosphates.  
**[0:44:14-0:44:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:44:14):**  And so this cocktail that we've created is now necessary because we have so much Roundup  
**[0:44:19-0:44:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:44:19):**  resistant weeds.  
**[0:44:20-0:44:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:44:20):**  You can no longer just spray Roundup.  
**[0:44:22-0:44:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:44:22):**  You can spray Roundup, dicamba, or 2,4-D, or atrazine in this chemical stew that's just  
**[0:44:27-0:44:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:44:27):**  like a disaster to life.  
**[0:44:29-0:44:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:44:29):**  And so we're spraying our fields in the United States now with these multi-chemical stews  
**[0:44:34-0:44:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:44:34):**  that will destroy things.  
**[0:44:36-0:44:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:44:36):**  But within that mix, I hold glyphosate as the primary ground zero of the global injury  
**[0:44:42-0:44:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:44:42):**  because of the way glyphosate works.  
**[0:44:44-0:44:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:44:44):**  So glyphosate damages the shikimate pathway, which is an enzyme pathway that undermines  
**[0:44:48-0:44:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:44:48):**  amino acid production.  
**[0:44:50-0:44:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:44:50):**  And importantly, it blocks three of the most critical amino acids in our nutrition, which  
**[0:44:54-0:44:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:44:54):**  are the essential amino acids.  
**[0:44:55-0:44:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:44:55):**  These are the ones that we can't produce as human beings.  
**[0:44:57-0:45:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:44:57):**  So we need to get them from either the bacteria in our gut or the plants we eat, which of  
**[0:45:01-0:45:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:45:01):**  course get those either through plant manufacturing or fungi and bacteria.  
**[0:45:04-0:45:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:45:04):**  Now we get back to the kale question.  
**[0:45:06-0:45:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:45:06):**  We get back to the kale.  
**[0:45:08-0:45:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:45:08):**  How did kale become toxic for humans?  
**[0:45:10-0:45:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:45:10):**  We started growing in an environment where it was blocking the ability of kale to make  
**[0:45:14-0:45:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:45:14):**  medicines within it.  
**[0:45:15-0:45:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:45:15):**  And we were left with a chemical residue that was breaking down the boundary of the human  
**[0:45:20-0:45:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:45:20):**  gut.  
**[0:45:21-0:45:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:45:21):**  And so this is the leaky gut phenomenon you hear about in the press.  
**[0:45:25-0:45:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:45:25):**  Leaky gut is really interesting in that it's reliant on a protein structure that's directly  
**[0:45:31-0:45:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:45:31):**  blown apart by glyphosate.  
**[0:45:33-0:45:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:45:33):**  And then we have a hard time rebuilding it because glyphosate has taken away the ability  
**[0:45:36-0:45:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:45:36):**  for us to have these essential amino acids as critical building blocks for those proteins.  
**[0:45:41-0:45:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:45:41):**  And so not only does it injure the cells, it's taken away the antidote or the reconstructive  
**[0:45:46-0:45:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:45:46):**  regenerative capacity of the cells through the deletion of these essential amino acids.  
**[0:45:50-0:45:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:45:50):**  There's nine essential amino acids out of the 22 amino acids that make up all the 280,000  
**[0:45:55-0:45:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:45:55):**  different proteins that make up the human body.  
**[0:45:58-0:46:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:45:58):**  And so it's very much like the alphabet.  
**[0:46:00-0:46:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:46:00):**  So you've got 26 letters and you've got five vowels.  
**[0:46:04-0:46:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:46:04):**  If you start to drop out the vowels, you start misspelling all of the words.  
**[0:46:08-0:46:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:46:08):**  That's what's happening with the essential amino acids.  
**[0:46:10-0:46:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:46:10):**  As we drop the essential amino acids out of the nutrition, we're starting to misspell  
**[0:46:14-0:46:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:46:14):**  all of the proteins in the human body.  
**[0:46:16-0:46:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:46:16):**  And that's how an infant at 18 months of age can have a cancer that used to be seen at  
**[0:46:20-0:46:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:46:20):**  80 because that child literally has misspelled all of the detox pathways, all the repair  
**[0:46:25-0:46:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:46:25):**  enzymes can be misspelled and therefore dysfunctional in their enzymatic three-dimensional structure.  
**[0:46:31-0:46:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:46:31):**  And so we have got this gatekeeper drug, if you will, or this gatekeeper injury of glyphosate,  
**[0:46:37-0:46:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:46:37):**  which is destroying and undermining the workhorse of the body, which is the microbiome, then  
**[0:46:41-0:46:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:46:41):**  causing direct damage to the tight junctions, which create this leaky sieve of the gut,  
**[0:46:45-0:46:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:46:45):**  the vascular tree, the blood-brain barrier.  
**[0:46:48-0:46:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:46:48):**  And our whole body is now overwhelmed every single day.  
**[0:46:51-0:46:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:46:51):**  When we breathe, when we eat, we're going to start to develop sensitivities and allergies  
**[0:46:55-0:46:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:46:55):**  to our environment because we can't keep the environment at bay.  
**[0:46:58-0:47:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:46:58):**  We can't keep it outside the body.  
**[0:47:00-0:47:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:47:00):**  So the environment is now moving into the immune system and now your immune system is  
**[0:47:03-0:47:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:47:03):**  in a constant battle against the environment you live in.  
**[0:47:06-0:47:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:47:06):**  And this is how we define a planet that no longer is amenable to human life.  
**[0:47:10-0:47:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:47:10):**  It's not because the planet changed, it's because the human no longer can tolerate life  
**[0:47:13-0:47:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:47:13):**  on Earth.  
**[0:47:14-0:47:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:47:14):**  And so with our extinction looming, if we continue on the path that we're on, we'll  
**[0:47:19-0:47:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:47:19):**  disappear and planet Earth will recover.  
**[0:47:21-0:47:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:47:21):**  And not only will she fight her way back to some sort of previous normal, she's going  
**[0:47:25-0:47:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:47:25):**  to come back more regenerative, more resilient than she ever has before.  
**[0:47:29-0:47:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:47:29):**  And my excitement about that is the evidence that we have in that fossil record.  
**[0:47:32-0:47:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:47:32):**  Every time we've had a great extinction event, we have an explosion of life right after that.  
**[0:47:37-0:47:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:47:37):**  And those few million years that unfold in the following, it's not like the Earth fights  
**[0:47:41-0:47:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:47:41):**  back to some previous normal.  
**[0:47:43-0:47:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:47:43):**  Instead, we have more biodiversity and more intelligence on the planet that's ever happened  
**[0:47:47-0:47:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:47:47):**  before.  
**[0:47:48-0:47:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:47:48):**  And I think that's going to happen again.  
**[0:47:49-0:47:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:47:49):**  And interestingly, that happens because of the viruses.  
**[0:47:52-0:47:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:47:52):**  When you put organisms under stress, they produce more genetic variants to allow for  
**[0:47:57-0:47:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:47:57):**  adaptation and biodiversity to occur.  
**[0:47:59-0:48:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:47:59):**  That's what viruses are.  
**[0:48:00-0:48:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:48:00):**  They're not living organisms.  
**[0:48:01-0:48:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:48:01):**  They have nothing to do with the microbiome.  
**[0:48:03-0:48:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:48:03):**  They're not part of the microbiome.  
**[0:48:04-0:48:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:48:04):**  They are literally the language of the microbiome and the language of multicellular organisms  
**[0:48:09-0:48:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:48:09):**  to one another.  
**[0:48:10-0:48:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:48:10):**  We communicate genetically through the virome.  
**[0:48:13-0:48:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:48:13):**  And so here we are running away from this virus as if it's going to kill humanity.  
**[0:48:17-0:48:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:48:17):**  We're going to die for the lack of vital life on Earth.  
**[0:48:20-0:48:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:48:20):**  And in the process, we will see the viruses survive us and they will code for a more complex,  
**[0:48:26-0:48:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:48:26):**  more resilient and more adaptive biology on the other side of this extinction event.  
**[0:48:29-0:48:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:48:29):**  And so the choice is do we want to be part of that transition or not?  
**[0:48:34-0:48:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:48:34):**  And I want to transition a bit because I'm going to be very conscious of your time and  
**[0:48:37-0:48:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:48:37):**  ask a few questions on the investment piece because I've heard you in many interviews  
**[0:48:43-0:48:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:48:43):**  and recently you've started mentioning impact investing and our impact investors as well.  
**[0:48:48-0:48:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:48:48):**  And so I'm changing gears a bit in this piece to make sure we can answer a few of those  
**[0:48:53-0:48:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:48:53):**  questions or at least I can ask them to you.  
**[0:48:55-0:48:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:48:55):**  This is a question I like to ask.  
**[0:48:56-0:49:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:48:56):**  I've been asking it a few times over the last months.  
**[0:49:00-0:49:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:49:00):**  And in some cases, people have never thought about this amount of money, but I think you  
**[0:49:03-0:49:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:49:03):**  have.  
**[0:49:04-0:49:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:49:04):**  What would you do if tomorrow morning or today, like after this interview, you'll be in charge  
**[0:49:08-0:49:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:49:08):**  of a $1 billion investment portfolio so you can freely invest it.  
**[0:49:12-0:49:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:49:12):**  It's not a grand portfolio.  
**[0:49:13-0:49:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:49:13):**  You can make some grants if you want, but what would you focus it on?  
**[0:49:16-0:49:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:49:16):**  What would you use it for to put that that amount of money, which is, I mean, people  
**[0:49:20-0:49:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:49:20):**  have said on the podcast, it's a lot and it's nothing at the same time.  
**[0:49:23-0:49:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:49:23):**  What would you use a billion dollars for to put it to work?  
**[0:49:26-0:49:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:49:26):**  Yeah, before I would mobilize that money, I would want to make sure that I had the right  
**[0:49:30-0:49:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:49:30):**  trade and so when you pick the wrong time to invest, it's a disaster, even if you're  
**[0:49:34-0:49:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:49:34):**  investing the right thing.  
**[0:49:36-0:49:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:49:36):**  So timing is everything and it has nothing to do with the time on the clock.  
**[0:49:39-0:49:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:49:39):**  It has nothing to do with the year.  
**[0:49:41-0:49:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:49:41):**  It has to do with the train that is set at that moment.  
**[0:49:44-0:49:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:49:44):**  And so I've known that, you know, and all of us in this space have known that a massive  
**[0:49:49-0:49:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:49:49):**  revolution is necessary and is already a foot.  
**[0:49:53-0:50:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:49:53):**  We have a 1.5 trillion dollar US agricultural system globally around 2.7 trillion estimate  
**[0:50:00-0:50:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:50:00):**  or something like that, which I think is an old estimate, a couple of years old.  
**[0:50:04-0:50:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:50:04):**  So give it a three trillion dollar global ag industry and it's already shifting.  
**[0:50:10-0:50:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:50:10):**  And that's only the measured part.  
**[0:50:11-0:50:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:50:11):**  That's only the small farmers are mostly, I mean, the people you met in the Philippines  
**[0:50:17-0:50:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:50:17):**  are mostly outside the system.  
**[0:50:18-0:50:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:50:18):**  They're not measured.  
**[0:50:19-0:50:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:50:19):**  They're definitely in the food system, but they're definitely not part of that amount.  
**[0:50:23-0:50:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:50:23):**  That's the modern chemical agricultural system basically is that 2.7 trillion.  
**[0:50:28-0:50:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:50:28):**  Outside of that is the people that are actually feeding 70% of the population.  
**[0:50:32-0:50:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:50:32):**  So chemical ag at three trillion dollars would feed about 30% of the population of the world.  
**[0:50:36-0:50:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:50:36):**  And so we have this interesting situation where a three trillion dollar industry of  
**[0:50:41-0:50:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:50:41):**  chemical ag has to pivot because the farmer is seeing their soil and farms die and they're  
**[0:50:47-0:50:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:50:47):**  going out of business and the consumer wants things to change now.  
**[0:50:51-0:50:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:50:51):**  So this was the moment we were waiting for in a lot of ways, but to get that moment right,  
**[0:50:55-0:50:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:50:55):**  you have to do awareness.  
**[0:50:56-0:51:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:50:56):**  And so before launching our impact investment fund, we've been working, we launched a nonprofit  
**[0:51:01-0:51:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:51:01):**  with the intention of creating awareness.  
**[0:51:04-0:51:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:51:04):**  The nonprofit is a storytelling agency that is running around the world, explaining everything  
**[0:51:09-0:51:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:51:09):**  that I've talked to you about the last hour in great detail and showing the science behind  
**[0:51:13-0:51:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:51:13):**  that to physicians, to consumers, to special interest groups, to investors and saying,  
**[0:51:18-0:51:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:51:18):**  here's what we've created.  
**[0:51:20-0:51:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:51:20):**  And with that awareness comes the opportunity then to mobilize money.  
**[0:51:23-0:51:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:51:23):**  And so we've been doing this kind of in a stepwise fashion, come to realize the problem.  
**[0:51:28-0:51:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:51:28):**  Then before trying to trigger the solutions, you need people to understand the scale and  
**[0:51:33-0:51:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:51:33):**  scope of the problem and the simple solutions that exist to that problem.  
**[0:51:37-0:51:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:51:37):**  So awareness has been our effort over the last two years.  
**[0:51:40-0:51:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:51:40):**  We've reached millions of consumers globally now.  
**[0:51:43-0:51:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:51:43):**  And I feel like we have a literal army behind us now of people banging the drum for change.  
**[0:51:49-0:51:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:51:49):**  And it started with mothers with autism.  
**[0:51:50-0:51:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:51:50):**  I launched my whole science and everything else in 2014 with Autism One in the United  
**[0:51:55-0:51:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:51:55):**  States, one of the largest autism events in the world.  
**[0:51:59-0:52:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:51:59):**  And there was 40,000 mothers of autistic children.  
**[0:52:03-0:52:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:52:03):**  And those mothers have become one of the most vocal and powerful groups I've ever worked  
**[0:52:08-0:52:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:52:08):**  with.  
**[0:52:09-0:52:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:52:09):**  They are more knowledgeable about autism and chemical toxicity than any physician out there.  
**[0:52:13-0:52:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:52:13):**  And these mothers are so well self-educated and they're mobilized for action.  
**[0:52:18-0:52:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:52:18):**  And so I think it's intriguing that moms are at the front of this transformation effort  
**[0:52:22-0:52:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:52:22):**  and are really going to give us the opportunity for massive transformation to the industry.  
**[0:52:28-0:52:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:52:28):**  Mothers all over the world, whether they have autistic children or not, are becoming increasingly  
**[0:52:32-0:52:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:52:32):**  aware of this crisis of nutrition within the home and the vulnerability of their children's  
**[0:52:37-0:52:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:52:37):**  health.  
**[0:52:38-0:52:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:52:38):**  They're seeing their children.  
**[0:52:39-0:52:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:52:39):**  Now in the United States and Western Europe, we're seeing 52 to 54% of children with a  
**[0:52:42-0:52:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:52:42):**  chronic disorder.  
**[0:52:43-0:52:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:52:43):**  There's more than one in two children having eczema, allergies, asthma, obesity, diabetes,  
**[0:52:49-0:52:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:52:49):**  precocious puberty, all these things.  
**[0:52:51-0:52:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:52:51):**  And moms are just very aware of this, even though the physicians tend to continue to  
**[0:52:54-0:52:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:52:54):**  deny this and not see the scope of it.  
**[0:52:56-0:52:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:52:56):**  They can give the children more medicine.  
**[0:52:58-0:52:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:52:58):**  Yeah.  
**[0:52:59-0:53:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:52:59):**  Giving the kids more meds, patching up the job.  
**[0:53:00-0:53:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:53:00):**  But let's imagine the audience is there, the awareness is there, and you have raised this  
**[0:53:04-0:53:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:53:04):**  1 billion, so the raising part is done.  
**[0:53:07-0:53:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:53:07):**  Or 10 billion, 100 billion, whatever amount you need, what would you focus on?  
**[0:53:11-0:53:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:53:11):**  Because I'm very interested in the decision making framework of people, what they focus  
**[0:53:15-0:53:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:53:15):**  there.  
**[0:53:16-0:53:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:53:16):**  They're limited by definition.  
**[0:53:17-0:53:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:53:17):**  It's always limited resources and time and money.  
**[0:53:20-0:53:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:53:20):**  And obviously the other researchers aren't.  
**[0:53:22-0:53:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:53:22):**  So what would you do if you had a nice portfolio basically to put to work?  
**[0:53:25-0:53:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:53:25):**  What would be a few things you would say, okay, I absolutely would do X, Y, Z?  
**[0:53:29-0:53:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:53:29):**  Yeah.  
**[0:53:30-0:53:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:53:30):**  The first two things is knowledge.  
**[0:53:31-0:53:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:53:31):**  So you've got a knowledge gap now in the farmer as much as the consumer.  
**[0:53:35-0:53:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:53:35):**  And so you need to close the knowledge gap of what is the moon to stop counting my success  
**[0:53:40-0:53:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:53:40):**  based on bushels of grain coming off my land and instead start thinking about carbon in  
**[0:53:44-0:53:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:53:44):**  my soil.  
**[0:53:45-0:53:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:53:45):**  Nutrient density, microbial density, how do I see a gap?  
**[0:53:49-0:53:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:53:49):**  So launch a Regen University, which we're working on there, to do that globally.  
**[0:53:54-0:53:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:53:54):**  So get the knowledge gap closing.  
**[0:53:56-0:54:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:53:56):**  At simultaneous to that, the knowledge gap isn't limited at the soil.  
**[0:54:00-0:54:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:54:00):**  The knowledge gap also is in the direct consumer interface.  
**[0:54:03-0:54:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:54:03):**  And so as we went to mega farms, our farmers failed or were extracted from the relationship  
**[0:54:09-0:54:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:54:09):**  to the consumer.  
**[0:54:10-0:54:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:54:10):**  In the United States, our farmers have gone from about 60 cents on the dollar that a consumer  
**[0:54:15-0:54:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:54:15):**  spending, getting back to the farm in the 1950s, 60s to today where we're at 14 cents  
**[0:54:20-0:54:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:54:20):**  on the dollar to getting back to that farmer.  
**[0:54:23-0:54:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:54:23):**  And so we extracted the farmer from that relationship.  
**[0:54:25-0:54:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:54:25):**  We ultimately extracted the wealth of the food system from the farmer and we're now  
**[0:54:29-0:54:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:54:29):**  handing that to middlemen and the rest.  
**[0:54:31-0:54:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:54:31):**  So we have to reeducate the farmer on how to reenter that relationship with the consumer.  
**[0:54:35-0:54:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:54:35):**  And of course we have all of the tools to do that today.  
**[0:54:38-0:54:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:54:38):**  The internet is allowing for this direct to consumer commerce to happen in a huge way.  
**[0:54:42-0:54:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:54:42):**  And so the knowledge gap is in a multiple levels.  
**[0:54:45-0:54:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:54:45):**  You solve for the soil thing, which is actually pretty easy because farmers deep in their  
**[0:54:49-0:54:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:54:49):**  tissue know how to manage land.  
**[0:54:52-0:54:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:54:52):**  They just have been taken away from that knowingness, but it doesn't take long to close that gap.  
**[0:54:56-0:55:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:54:56):**  The bigger gap is then to find them the importance of what they're doing.  
**[0:55:00-0:55:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:55:00):**  And in the end, I think that the secret sauce is interesting there.  
**[0:55:04-0:55:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:55:04):**  It's not selling a product.  
**[0:55:05-0:55:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:55:05):**  It's telling your own story that's going to create the direct consumer demand.  
**[0:55:09-0:55:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:55:09):**  Let the consumer see your passion, your spiritual purpose within your soil system, within your,  
**[0:55:14-0:55:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:55:14):**  what you're doing.  
**[0:55:15-0:55:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:55:15):**  That's going to inspire that consumer to be your devout supporter and love your products.  
**[0:55:21-0:55:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:55:21):**  And so get the human back in the farmer again is really critical piece of this investment  
**[0:55:25-0:55:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:55:25):**  strategy.  
**[0:55:27-0:55:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:55:27):**  So you're investing in knowledge base, you're investing in an awareness campaign back to  
**[0:55:31-0:55:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:55:31):**  the farmer in some ways.  
**[0:55:32-0:55:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:55:32):**  Simultaneous to that, you need to rev up the capacity for those farmers, not just to learn  
**[0:55:37-0:55:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:55:37):**  the soil science, but actually to cure the alternative toolbox.  
**[0:55:40-0:55:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:55:40):**  And so zipper up a couple of companies that are able to expand their technologies to help  
**[0:55:45-0:55:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:55:45):**  procure inputs that are more expensive, typically some biologic inputs and things like this,  
**[0:55:50-0:55:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:55:50):**  instead of the chemical ag, you know, small molecule stuff.  
**[0:55:53-0:55:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:55:53):**  And so bundle purchasing, bundle the capacity for farmers to know not only what to put in,  
**[0:55:59-0:56:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:55:59):**  but how to procure those at an affordable rate and then how to make the transition.  
**[0:56:03-0:56:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:56:03):**  How do you wean soil off of the chemicals?  
**[0:56:05-0:56:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:56:05):**  How do you get all of that?  
**[0:56:07-0:56:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:56:07):**  That can be done with a couple of companies that are strategically placed in next to each  
**[0:56:10-0:56:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:56:10):**  other to do the education and procurement and mean these farmers to their own success.  
**[0:56:16-0:56:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:56:16):**  And so that pattern is kind of the step one.  
**[0:56:18-0:56:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:56:18):**  Next you're investing in infrastructure.  
**[0:56:20-0:56:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:56:20):**  And so everything from distribution or storage, you know, you're moving from the farm to storage  
**[0:56:26-0:56:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:56:26):**  units, then distribution from storage out to the secondary storage, which is kind of  
**[0:56:31-0:56:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:56:31):**  the beginning of that last mile distribution, which is always the most challenging part  
**[0:56:34-0:56:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:56:34):**  of M&E infrastructure is the last mile.  
**[0:56:37-0:56:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:56:37):**  And so that final storage site and then the last mile, you know, kind of micro distribution  
**[0:56:42-0:56:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:56:42):**  events in that whole thing, my investment strategy is going to really contain that concept  
**[0:56:48-0:56:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:56:48):**  of decentralization.  
**[0:56:50-0:56:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:56:50):**  The reason we got to the problems we did was through the belief that we could scale things  
**[0:56:54-0:56:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:56:54):**  globally.  
**[0:56:55-0:56:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:56:55):**  We could come up with an innovation, we could come up with a shipping thing, we could scale  
**[0:56:57-0:56:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:56:57):**  that globally.  
**[0:56:58-0:57:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:56:58):**  We need to lose that concept of centralized and kind of globalization of scaling.  
**[0:57:04-0:57:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:57:04):**  We need to instead...  
**[0:57:06-0:57:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:57:06):**  Everything is the same.  
**[0:57:07-0:57:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:57:07):**  Every tomato you ever plant, if it's in Kansas or in Vietnam, it's exactly the same.  
**[0:57:13-0:57:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:57:13):**  Or even this truck is how we're going to distribute it.  
**[0:57:15-0:57:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:57:15):**  And so therefore we need to buy these trucks all over the world.  
**[0:57:17-0:57:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:57:17):**  Like it turns out that every single environment needs its own microcosm variation of what  
**[0:57:24-0:57:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:57:24):**  you've seen or what you've done.  
**[0:57:26-0:57:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:57:26):**  And so I'm going to be interested to invest in companies that are innovative, but then  
**[0:57:31-0:57:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:57:31):**  instead of letting them try to scale that globally and pour more and more money into  
**[0:57:35-0:57:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:57:35):**  them to scale, I'm going to ask them to become seeds literally in the soil of companies all  
**[0:57:40-0:57:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:57:40):**  over the world.  
**[0:57:41-0:57:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:57:41):**  Okay, you've got a good innovation, you've got a good idea.  
**[0:57:43-0:57:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:57:43):**  We're going to now seed you into different environments.  
**[0:57:45-0:57:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:57:45):**  So we're going to start companies all over the world now that are going to take your  
**[0:57:49-0:57:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:57:49):**  innovation.  
**[0:57:50-0:57:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:57:50):**  You're going to become a stakeholder within that company, but you're going to let the  
**[0:57:54-0:57:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:57:54):**  local innovators take that and adapt that through the local ecosystem, through the local  
**[0:57:58-0:58:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:57:58):**  culture and create a culturally sensitive, culturally relevant and ecosystem relevant  
**[0:58:03-0:58:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:58:03):**  product on that side.  
**[0:58:05-0:58:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:58:05):**  And now you might be a stakeholder as an innovator in 10 or 50 or 100 different companies around  
**[0:58:09-0:58:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:58:09):**  the world and get to have the joy of watching success like pouring out all over the place  
**[0:58:14-0:58:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:58:14):**  with innovations you could have never come up with because you have such a narrow cultural  
**[0:58:17-0:58:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:58:17):**  and ecosystem worldview.  
**[0:58:19-0:58:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:58:19):**  So that's what I would start to invest in is a decentralized empowerment system where  
**[0:58:24-0:58:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:58:24):**  successful entrepreneurs can become more successful than they ever dreamed through a decentralized  
**[0:58:30-0:58:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:58:30):**  system of spread or seeding rather than scaling.  
**[0:58:35-0:58:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:58:35):**  Finally then you need to solve for kind of the last couple of major pieces in there,  
**[0:58:40-0:58:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:58:40):**  which are kind of around this transition to the consumer industry and CPG kind of companies.  
**[0:58:46-0:58:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:58:46):**  And so you need to simultaneously bring in demand from your fortune 500 companies and  
**[0:58:51-0:58:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:58:51):**  those that are really controlling those supply lines to help them start to make the transition  
**[0:58:55-0:58:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:58:55):**  in their CPG brands.  
**[0:58:57-0:59:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:58:57):**  And so that piece again, it has all of those tiers of awareness, knowledge and infrastructure,  
**[0:59:02-0:59:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:59:02):**  delivery, all of that.  
**[0:59:04-0:59:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:59:04):**  Because it's very tricky because they're being completely used to commoditize everything.  
**[0:59:09-0:59:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:59:09):**  And this is completely decommoditizing the whole supply web basically.  
**[0:59:13-0:59:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:59:13):**  And that's going to be a very big challenge for a lot of these huge brands that are not  
**[0:59:17-0:59:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:59:17):**  known.  
**[0:59:18-0:59:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:59:18):**  They usually don't even know they're a farmer they're buying from indirectly, usually from  
**[0:59:23-0:59:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:59:23):**  16 different steps.  
**[0:59:25-0:59:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:59:25):**  But they do need to know it if they ever want to play in this new game.  
**[0:59:28-0:59:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:59:28):**  That's exactly right.  
**[0:59:30-0:59:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:59:30):**  And in the end, you know, what I've just described to you is an ecosystem strategy for investment.  
**[0:59:36-0:59:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:59:36):**  There's an ecosystem that needs to be invested in to make this transition happen faster.  
**[0:59:40-0:59:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:59:40):**  I do want to emphasize that this game has already been won.  
**[0:59:43-0:59:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:59:43):**  I believe humans are here to stay.  
**[0:59:45-0:59:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:59:45):**  I don't think we're going extinct.  
**[0:59:46-0:59:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:59:46):**  I think we are going to win.  
**[0:59:48-0:59:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:59:48):**  It's a good thing after an hour of doom and gloom.  
**[0:59:51-0:59:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:59:51):**  Yeah, it is.  
**[0:59:52-0:59:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:59:52):**  It's important.  
**[0:59:53-0:59:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:59:53):**  And I really believe that this game of transitioning agriculture is already been won.  
**[0:59:58-1:00:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=0:59:58):**  It's happening too fast through too many different farmers now to be stopped.  
**[1:00:03-1:00:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:00:03):**  It's multifocal.  
**[1:00:04-1:00:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:00:04):**  It's got all of the right stakeholders at the table.  
**[1:00:08-1:00:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:00:08):**  It's already won.  
**[1:00:09-1:00:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:00:09):**  We are going to be a regenerative agriculture system in the next 20 years.  
**[1:00:11-1:00:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:00:11):**  If we aren't, we go extinct.  
**[1:00:13-1:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:00:13):**  But I don't think we're going to stay.  
**[1:00:14-1:00:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:00:14):**  I think we're too smart.  
**[1:00:15-1:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:00:15):**  I think we're too innovative to let us go down that path.  
**[1:00:18-1:00:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:00:18):**  But we don't have the time for the linear change that typically takes to happen.  
**[1:00:23-1:00:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:00:23):**  In the linear journey, it takes a farmer five years to make the transition in their psychological  
**[1:00:28-1:00:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:00:28):**  head to make this change on the farm.  
**[1:00:30-1:00:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:00:30):**  Whereas biology will change in three months.  
**[1:00:32-1:00:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:00:32):**  And so we can't wait for every farmer to wait that five year psychological journey.  
**[1:00:36-1:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:00:36):**  So we need to accelerate that.  
**[1:00:38-1:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:00:38):**  And so this impact investment plan that we're putting together is not about trying to micromanage  
**[1:00:44-1:00:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:00:44):**  anything.  
**[1:00:45-1:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:00:45):**  It's to inspire everybody to go faster about in the lanes they're already going and then  
**[1:00:49-1:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:00:49):**  synergistically and strategically zipper them together into more functional units.  
**[1:00:54-1:00:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:00:54):**  Too often an innovator or an entrepreneur fails because of that inventor mentality of  
**[1:00:59-1:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:00:59):**  like, I've got the best thing and I don't want to let anybody steal my IP.  
**[1:01:03-1:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:01:03):**  I hear something of a vitamin A component.  
**[1:01:06-1:01:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:01:06):**  You told me half an hour ago.  
**[1:01:08-1:01:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:01:08):**  Yeah.  
**[1:01:09-1:01:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:01:09):**  And so there's an innovative approach to investing now today where you can overcome that by showing  
**[1:01:14-1:01:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:01:14):**  synergy.  
**[1:01:15-1:01:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:01:15):**  You're going to keep your IP.  
**[1:01:17-1:01:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:01:17):**  We're going to allow you to have it.  
**[1:01:18-1:01:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:01:18):**  We're going to make it a lot more valuable by zipping it together with a couple other  
**[1:01:20-1:01:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:01:20):**  pieces of IP.  
**[1:01:22-1:01:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:01:22):**  So instead of saying, Oh, I'll license your IP and scale that globally, or I'll put a team  
**[1:01:26-1:01:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:01:26):**  around that and you just sit down and I'll say, that's where the inventor recoils and  
**[1:01:31-1:01:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:01:31):**  says, no, that's mine.  
**[1:01:32-1:01:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:01:32):**  You can't take that from me.  
**[1:01:34-1:01:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:01:34):**  You show an entrepreneur synergy and I can make your, you far more successful as zippered  
**[1:01:38-1:01:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:01:38):**  together a couple of other pieces of IP.  
**[1:01:40-1:01:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:01:40):**  That's a much different story.  
**[1:01:42-1:01:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:01:42):**  And I think we can solve for the inventor mentality with our investment strategy.  
**[1:01:47-1:01:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:01:47):**  We're going to invest in synergy between humans.  
**[1:01:49-1:01:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:01:49):**  And this is, again, this is a biologic model of economics.  
**[1:01:54-1:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:01:54):**  If we look at the microbiome, it's secret is not because there's some mega perfect fungi.  
**[1:02:00-1:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:02:00):**  There is no perfect good bacteria.  
**[1:02:03-1:02:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:02:03):**  The truth and the vitality of life that comes out of the microbiome is founded upon its  
**[1:02:08-1:02:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:02:08):**  biodiversity.  
**[1:02:10-1:02:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:02:10):**  And so if we allow entrepreneurs to start to realize that they are part of an ecosystem  
**[1:02:14-1:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:02:14):**  of brilliance and they can start to be part of a hyper intelligence of innovation by connecting  
**[1:02:20-1:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:02:20):**  one another, then we change the whole stratosphere, if you will, of potential.  
**[1:02:25-1:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:02:25):**  We're going to push up the level of rise radically as we empower entrepreneurs to do their best  
**[1:02:31-1:02:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:02:31):**  work together.  
**[1:02:33-1:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:02:33):**  And when I say together, it's not like I'll come around one idea, bring lots of ideas  
**[1:02:37-1:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:02:37):**  together, find the synergistic relationships therein.  
**[1:02:39-1:02:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:02:39):**  And now you've created a fungal mycelial bed of intelligence and the mycelium are the hyper  
**[1:02:45-1:02:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:02:45):**  intelligent ecosystem on the planet.  
**[1:02:47-1:02:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:02:47):**  And so that mycelial communication network that's pushing nutrients all over a farm,  
**[1:02:53-1:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:02:53):**  hundreds of miles that mycelium can move a specific nutrient to where it's most needed.  
**[1:02:58-1:03:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:02:58):**  This reality is getting at the potential that we as humans could start to function as we  
**[1:03:03-1:03:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:03:03):**  have never functioned before in concert together.  
**[1:03:06-1:03:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:03:06):**  We have always acted in siloed vessels or in single little groups that will innovate  
**[1:03:11-1:03:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:03:11):**  for the world and then try to scale that in an empire kind of building.  
**[1:03:14-1:03:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:03:14):**  If we allow ourselves to become multivariate, multidiverse in our bio ecosystem of investment  
**[1:03:20-1:03:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:03:20):**  and business strategy, we haven't even seen that level of innovation before.  
**[1:03:25-1:03:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:03:25):**  And so this is how I think we're going to solve for the cataclysmic loss of life on  
**[1:03:29-1:03:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:03:29):**  the earth right now is we're going to innovate faster, transform faster, change the world  
**[1:03:33-1:03:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:03:33):**  faster.  
**[1:03:34-1:03:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:03:34):**  It is the most important event that's ever happened in the history of investment.  
**[1:03:38-1:03:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:03:38):**  There's not a single thing more important than changing the way in which humans interact  
**[1:03:43-1:03:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:03:43):**  with their nature.  
**[1:03:44-1:03:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:03:44):**  If we don't fundamentally shift that, we go extinct.  
**[1:03:47-1:03:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:03:47):**  But more exciting, we've put an extinction level stress on the whole planet, which means  
**[1:03:51-1:03:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:03:51):**  we have more viral intelligence on the planet than we ever have before, which means that  
**[1:03:56-1:04:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:03:56):**  if we stop the extinction and we start to realign with nature, we're not going to participate  
**[1:04:01-1:04:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:04:01):**  in the recovery of some previous life.  
**[1:04:03-1:04:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:04:03):**  We're going to see the explosion of biodiversity and intelligence on the planet that's never  
**[1:04:07-1:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:04:07):**  been seen before because we have that level of biologic intelligence and adaptation built  
**[1:04:12-1:04:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:04:12):**  within the biome today.  
**[1:04:13-1:04:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:04:13):**  The pandemic of today is the potential for tomorrow.  
**[1:04:16-1:04:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:04:16):**  We need that mentality and we need to invest strategically to manifest that future.  
**[1:04:22-1:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:04:22):**  I want to thank you so much, Zach.  
**[1:04:23-1:04:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:04:23):**  There's a hundred thousand other things to unpack and to ask, and I hope it's not the  
**[1:04:27-1:04:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:04:27):**  last time we talk, but I want to be conscious of your time and make sure you can go on to  
**[1:04:31-1:04:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:04:31):**  your next course.  
**[1:04:32-1:04:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:04:32):**  And thank you so much for taking the time today to share more on the connection, healthy  
**[1:04:38-1:04:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:04:38):**  soils, healthy people, healthy ecosystems, and everything that comes with that.  
**[1:04:42-1:04:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:04:42):**  Thank you so much, Cohen.  
**[1:04:43-1:04:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:04:43):**  It's been a real pleasure to be with you.  
**[1:04:44-1:04:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:04:44):**  I just appreciate what you're doing as a voice box and communicator for this entire industry

**[1:07:56-1:08:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:07:56):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  
**[1:08:02-1:08:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:08:02):**  so you don't have to write along.  
**[1:08:04-1:08:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:08:04):**  We're gonna look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[1:08:09-1:08:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:08:09):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to

**[1:08:19-1:08:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:08:19):**  if you're a soil builder.  
**[1:08:21-1:08:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:08:21):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[1:08:26-1:08:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:08:26):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.

**[1:08:34-1:08:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:08:34):**  So what is it not?  
**[1:08:35-1:08:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:08:35):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[1:08:37-1:08:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:08:37):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[1:08:40-1:08:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:08:40):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[1:08:43-1:08:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:08:43):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[1:08:45-1:08:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/10/12/zach-bush#t=1:08:45):**  Before making any investment please find professional investment advice.

**[0:00:12-0:00:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:00:12):**  Now on to the podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:00:13):**  In this interview you will learn about how two of the most experienced regenerative investors  
**[0:00:19-0:00:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:00:19):**  who have been investing in regenerative food systems, farmers and companies for the last  
**[0:00:23-0:00:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:00:23):**  almost 20 years are approaching a regenerative transition like the one on Benedict's farm.  
**[0:00:40-0:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:00:40):**  Welcome to Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:00:44):**  This is a special dedicated series on transition finance.  
**[0:00:48-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:00:48):**  Why are we recording this series?  
**[0:00:49-0:00:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:00:49):**  Many farmers are ready to speed up their regenerative transition.  
**[0:00:53-0:00:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:00:53):**  They've looked for learning, done the courses, read the key books, hosted the gurus on their  
**[0:00:57-0:01:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:00:57):**  farms, explored farm-sized regenerative designs and most importantly started their pilots  
**[0:01:02-0:01:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:01:02):**  and feedback loops.  
**[0:01:04-0:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:01:04):**  This is where transition finance is key.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:01:06):**  A local bank loan often isn't feasible because of the short duration, lack of flexibility  
**[0:01:11-0:01:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:01:11):**  and the farmers lack of collateral.  
**[0:01:13-0:01:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:01:13):**  Furthermore, there is a limit of how much equity a farmer is able or willing to give  
**[0:01:18-0:01:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:01:18):**  away.  
**[0:01:19-0:01:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:01:19):**  That is why my co-host aspiring to be regenerative farmer Benedikt Boezel and I are embarking  
**[0:01:25-0:01:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:01:25):**  on a journey to find out what are the key principles of transition finance for regenerative  
**[0:01:30-0:01:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:01:30):**  farmers.  
**[0:01:32-0:01:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:01:32):**  We are interviewing leading practitioners in the regenerative agriculture and food finance  
**[0:01:36-0:01:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:01:36):**  space.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:01:37):**  They share their insights how they would finance the speed up of the regenerative transition  
**[0:01:41-0:01:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:01:41):**  on Benedict's 1000 hectares which is almost 2500 acres farm in Germany close to Berlin.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:01:48):**  This is an open process.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:01:49):**  We are sharing our lessons through the podcast episodes as we go along.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:01:53):**  We don't have the answers yet, just a lot of questions.  
**[0:01:56-0:02:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:01:56):**  So please share with us any examples of transition finance you've seen, other inspiration, people  
**[0:02:01-0:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:02:01):**  to interview etc.

**[0:02:14-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:02:14):**  So welcome to another episode in the transition finance series and today we're here with  
**[0:02:18-0:02:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:02:18):**  the founders of Cienaga Capital and the No Regrets initiative, Sally Calhoun and Esther  
**[0:02:22-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:02:22):**  Park which we both had on the podcast before but never together.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:02:25):**  It's the first time I think we're with four people.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:02:28):**  So I'm very happy to have Benedikt Boezel back, obviously my co-host and Sally and Esther.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:02:34):**  Welcome to you all on this March afternoon in very crazy times in terms of the coronavirus.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:02:40):**  I don't know when people are going to listen to us but we're definitely all in lockdown  
**[0:02:43-0:02:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:02:43):**  and dealing with these issues so we might kind of spend a bit of time on that but I'm  
**[0:02:47-0:02:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:02:47):**  very interested to dive deeper into transition finance and have you all here in this afternoon  
**[0:02:52-0:02:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:02:52):**  on the call.  
**[0:02:53-0:02:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:02:53):**  Great, thank you.  
**[0:02:54-0:02:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:02:54):**  Glad to be here.  
**[0:02:55-0:02:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:02:55):**  Thank you.  
**[0:02:56-0:03:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:02:56):**  And just a brief intro of our two guests.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:03:00):**  We have two guests on the call today, Benedikt, so I'm very happy with that and could you,  
**[0:03:05-0:03:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:03:05):**  for everybody that didn't listen to our early interviews, I will definitely link them below  
**[0:03:08-0:03:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:03:08):**  to briefly introduce yourselves, Sally and Esther, so we have a short understanding  
**[0:03:13-0:03:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:03:13):**  before we dive into this interview and then everybody should listen to the other ones  
**[0:03:16-0:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:03:16):**  obviously.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:03:17):**  Okay, so my name is Sally Calhoun and I spent about 25 years in technology and then almost  
**[0:03:23-0:03:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:03:23):**  20 years ago ended up becoming a rancher in central California.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:03:26):**  Since then, I have been doing a lot of work on the ground around regenerating healthy  
**[0:03:30-0:03:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:03:30):**  ecosystems while producing food, fuel and fiber and then managed to get into impact  
**[0:03:35-0:03:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:03:35):**  investing and philanthropy around the same issues and that whole effort is called the  
**[0:03:41-0:03:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:03:41):**  No Regrets Initiative.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:03:42):**  And what about you Esther?  
**[0:03:43-0:03:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:03:43):**  What brings you here today?  
**[0:03:44-0:03:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:03:44):**  Yes, I'm Esther Park.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:03:46):**  I head at Cienega Capital, which is part of the No Regrets Initiative and it's our private  
**[0:03:51-0:03:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:03:51):**  investing vehicle where we invest in regenerative agriculture enterprises, so that includes  
**[0:03:58-0:04:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:03:58):**  farms and food businesses.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:04:00):**  And obviously my colleague, Benedikt, is on the call as well.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:04:04):**  Yes, let me say that I'm really, really excited, if not nervous, to have both of you on the  
**[0:04:10-0:04:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:04:10):**  call.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:04:11):**  I see you have been visionaries in the field and at the very forefront of not only taking  
**[0:04:18-0:04:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:04:18):**  a risk but also having no regrets afterwards.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:04:21):**  I think that is really important and I love the title of it.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:04:24):**  And Kun, you just said it, we have a really tough time, really challenging time with regards  
**[0:04:30-0:04:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:04:30):**  to the COVID or coronavirus and then having those kind of figures as you are, Esther and  
**[0:04:36-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:04:36):**  Sally, that gives hope for all of us.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:04:39):**  So very grateful to have you guys on the call and looking forward to hear what you can share  
**[0:04:44-0:04:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:04:44):**  with us from your experience.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:04:46):**  Yes, so to dive in with that straight away, I've had the pleasure to meet both of you  
**[0:04:51-0:04:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:04:51):**  actually in person and also visit the farm and see a bit how you operate.  
**[0:04:56-0:04:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:04:56):**  But I would love to know how would you approach something in this case?  
**[0:04:59-0:05:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:04:59):**  Obviously, you're not financing anything outside the US, so it's not a pitch.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:05:03):**  We're not pitching Benedikt's farm.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:05:05):**  But let's say a farmer like Benedikt knocks on your door and not in this case, virtually  
**[0:05:11-0:05:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:05:11):**  obviously, because we cannot contaminate anyone, but knocks on the door and says, I'm operating  
**[0:05:16-0:05:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:05:16):**  this farm, I want to go faster, I want to transition and my local bank has no idea what  
**[0:05:21-0:05:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:05:21):**  I'm doing.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:05:23):**  And I know some VC investors, etc., but they probably also don't really know what I'm doing.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:05:27):**  Plus, let's say the investment model is a bit tricky.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:05:30):**  What would be your first questions?  
**[0:05:31-0:05:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:05:31):**  What would be your first understanding to approach more to understand more to see, to  
**[0:05:36-0:05:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:05:36):**  get a bit deeper into the case to see if it's something you might could work on from your  
**[0:05:41-0:05:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:05:41):**  initiative?  
**[0:05:42-0:05:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:05:42):**  Well, I guess I would ask, what does going faster mean?  
**[0:05:45-0:05:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:05:45):**  And what does that look like?  
**[0:05:47-0:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:05:47):**  And I would try to understand what kind of existing business and revenues are going on  
**[0:05:54-0:06:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:05:54):**  at the farm and see, is there a clear line between what's going on today and what you  
**[0:06:01-0:06:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:06:01):**  plan or hope to have going on in the future?  
**[0:06:05-0:06:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:06:05):**  And so what is the acceleration of that line look like?  
**[0:06:09-0:06:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:06:09):**  What does that mean to you?  
**[0:06:10-0:06:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:06:10):**  What kind of financing do you think you need for that?  
**[0:06:13-0:06:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:06:13):**  And then we would just go into questions around the planning, the financial model, as well  
**[0:06:20-0:06:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:06:20):**  as just understanding his local situation and the markets that surround it.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:06:26):**  And I think that if it's a reasonable plan, what we would try to do is figure out what  
**[0:06:31-0:06:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:06:31):**  is the right financing that's appropriate for him.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:06:35):**  And that's kind of how we approach most of the things that we do.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:06:38):**  It's sort of starting with what is your context, what is your situation, and what is your plan,  
**[0:06:43-0:06:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:06:43):**  and then trying to find the right kind of financing, the form of financing that'll fit  
**[0:06:48-0:06:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:06:48):**  that situation.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:06:49):**  So depending on what it's for, it could mean that there's a debt investment alone of some  
**[0:06:56-0:07:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:06:56):**  kind or if Benedict has some kind of operation where he might be aggregating product from  
**[0:07:03-0:07:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:07:03):**  multiple farms and selling under a common brand, there could be some kind of an equity  
**[0:07:08-0:07:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:07:08):**  play there.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:07:09):**  So it just depends.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:07:10):**  It depends on the business model, what's going on, and what the financing is for.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:07:15):**  And I think the first thing, one of the first things Esther would say is don't spend too  
**[0:07:18-0:07:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:07:18):**  much time talking to the venture capitalists.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:07:20):**  Right.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:07:21):**  Yeah.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:07:22):**  Especially in this sector.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:07:26):**  This is actually such an interesting part of the discussion.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:07:29):**  And I often talk with people about it, not only investors, but people who are into farming  
**[0:07:35-0:07:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:07:35):**  or people who are close to farming.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:07:37):**  And because we always say, how can we scale regenerative technologies?  
**[0:07:40-0:07:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:07:40):**  How can we stay regenerative agriculture?  
**[0:07:43-0:07:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:07:43):**  And I think one of the key, let's say difficulties is, and Sally, I would really like to know  
**[0:07:50-0:07:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:07:50):**  how you see that, is that there is quite a few, that the uncertainty of it is still very  
**[0:07:58-0:08:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:07:58):**  large, especially if it's not so strongly basically aggregating products from around  
**[0:08:02-0:08:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:08:02):**  other farms and then having an easy to go with business model, let's say.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:08:07):**  But actually to say, I want to regenerate the land, I want to change the regime of treating  
**[0:08:12-0:08:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:08:12):**  the land, it is supposedly going to soil health and I will need a time of five, six, seven,  
**[0:08:19-0:08:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:08:19):**  maybe 10 years in which I will have to change the whole setting, basically the whole philosophy.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:08:26):**  So there is this vision on one side where there's just so much uncertainty and on the  
**[0:08:31-0:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:08:31):**  other side you have a financial model and a plan.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:08:34):**  And I mean, I can't do that.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:08:36):**  I've been in investment banking before and I know how to tweak the numbers, so to say.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:08:40):**  But having those two realities in a sense and where is the truth and how open or not  
**[0:08:46-0:08:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:08:46):**  how open, but how can you somehow find the right mix, which you want to be responsible  
**[0:08:53-0:08:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:08:53):**  about if you're taking on a third party, money of a third party.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:08:58):**  And like, how do you, Sally, from sort of the visionary point of view, how would you  
**[0:09:02-0:09:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:09:02):**  go about that or what would be your approach?  
**[0:09:05-0:09:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:09:05):**  So as I think you're right, there's this tremendous uncertainty.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:09:08):**  None of us have any idea how this really turns out at scale or how we can make this happen.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:09:14):**  But maybe it's just that the uncertainty here is more obvious than it is in a lot of places.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:09:20):**  Maybe we are less willing to hang our hats on some spreadsheet that's been finagled  
**[0:09:25-0:09:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:09:25):**  than a lot of other people are.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:09:27):**  If you look at venture capitalists, they assume that at least 50 percent of their companies  
**[0:09:30-0:09:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:09:30):**  will just fail.  
**[0:09:32-0:09:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:09:32):**  Forty percent will probably not do well.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:09:34):**  So they're taking this huge risk.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:09:36):**  But unfortunately, in our society, then we want this giant return, possibility of return  
**[0:09:41-0:09:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:09:41):**  in exchange.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:09:42):**  But I mean, Esther and I often say that we think that the perception of return, financial  
**[0:09:47-0:09:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:09:47):**  return is of market rate is higher than it actually is even in the market.  
**[0:09:53-0:09:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:09:53):**  So I think it's right now, I think you have to find investors who are willing to look  
**[0:09:57-0:10:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:09:57):**  more broadly at return and take social return and ecological return along with financial  
**[0:10:02-0:10:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:10:02):**  return.  
**[0:10:03-0:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:10:03):**  I don't honestly have any idea how we get the whole world, the whole investment world  
**[0:10:07-0:10:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:10:07):**  to feel that way.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:10:08):**  I sort of think that basically we are like starting a little snowball, the investors  
**[0:10:13-0:10:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:10:13):**  who are willing to do this now.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:10:15):**  And it's going to take probably not investment capital to scale this.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:10:20):**  It's going to take the world realizing that this is as important as the trillion dollars  
**[0:10:24-0:10:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:10:24):**  we're about to spend on the coronavirus in the United States.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:10:28):**  And that as a society, we're going to have to that's how we're going to scale societally,  
**[0:10:32-0:10:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:10:32):**  this society can look at all those different returns.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:10:35):**  So that's not a particularly great answer for someone looking for financial backing  
**[0:10:40-0:10:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:10:40):**  at this point in time.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:10:41):**  But that's kind of that's the best answer that I can come up with.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:10:44):**  I don't really know how investors scale this, given the uncertainty, the time required and  
**[0:10:51-0:10:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:10:51):**  the relatively small financial return that's linked to ecological return at this point  
**[0:10:55-0:10:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:10:55):**  in time.  
**[0:10:56-0:10:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:10:56):**  Right.  
**[0:10:57-0:10:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:10:57):**  I mean, this I feel you.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:10:58):**  This is exactly what I believe, to be honest with you, but my more sort of critic friends  
**[0:11:03-0:11:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:11:03):**  or critic farmers or visitors who are more critical about this, they would say and there's  
**[0:11:09-0:11:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:11:09):**  a lot of honesty and truth to that, that, you know, saying, well, social and ecological  
**[0:11:14-0:11:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:11:14):**  capital, I mean, it's good and we all want it and we need it.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:11:17):**  But in the end of the day, it has to be obviously economically viable.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:11:21):**  And we all believe that it is.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:11:22):**  And I think there's farmers all over the world who are showing that it is economically viable  
**[0:11:27-0:11:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:11:27):**  and quite well.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:11:29):**  But Esther, like what would you say, you know, coming more from the sort of investment angle,  
**[0:11:34-0:11:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:11:34):**  what is your approach about that?  
**[0:11:37-0:11:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:11:37):**  Do you think we can actually see a change basically in a potential financial product  
**[0:11:42-0:11:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:11:42):**  that says, well, you know, in the time span of maybe 10 years, we will have three or four  
**[0:11:48-0:11:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:11:48):**  years that we already basically discount in a way that we know that there might be a crisis  
**[0:11:53-0:11:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:11:53):**  and there might not be a new tea being paid.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:11:57):**  So how do you see the flexibility of financial products with regard to, you know, what we're  
**[0:12:01-0:12:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:12:01):**  trying to achieve?  
**[0:12:02-0:12:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:12:02):**  Yeah, I think that you can build in flexibility into financial products.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:12:09):**  We do it all the time.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:12:10):**  I think what the real flexibility that needs to happen is in the mind and in the frameworks  
**[0:12:16-0:12:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:12:16):**  that we think about things, you know, because we talk about, you mentioned scale, how do  
**[0:12:20-0:12:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:12:20):**  we scale this thing?  
**[0:12:21-0:12:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:12:21):**  Well, you know, we have scaled traditional agriculture and look at how that turned out.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:12:26):**  Right.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:12:27):**  So I think one of the things that we talk about is scaling across as opposed to scaling  
**[0:12:32-0:12:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:12:32):**  up.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:12:33):**  So how can we take models of people who are doing this well and doing it, you know, in  
**[0:12:38-0:12:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:12:38):**  a financially viable way?  
**[0:12:40-0:12:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:12:40):**  And how can we replicate that across regions and climates and soil types and all of those  
**[0:12:46-0:12:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:12:46):**  kinds of things?  
**[0:12:47-0:12:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:12:47):**  And there's one farmer in particular I remember talking to who said, actually, he wants to  
**[0:12:53-0:12:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:12:53):**  be able to try to do more on fewer acres.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:12:56):**  So he actually wants to shrink his operation, but he thinks he can actually produce more  
**[0:13:01-0:13:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:13:01):**  and create more revenue on fewer acres.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:13:03):**  So that was a really interesting concept to me about thinking differently about how you  
**[0:13:09-0:13:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:13:09):**  can scale an operation or, you know, what is this concept of scale?  
**[0:13:14-0:13:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:13:14):**  Why do we need it?  
**[0:13:15-0:13:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:13:15):**  What we actually want and what we actually need is more people on the land doing these  
**[0:13:20-0:13:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:13:20):**  types of practices and being in relationship with nature and our ecology and our food system,  
**[0:13:26-0:13:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:13:26):**  rather than, you know, bigger operations with fewer people.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:13:30):**  So I think we're trying to think about risk and scale and return a little bit differently  
**[0:13:37-0:13:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:13:37):**  in terms of, you know, and then just in terms of financial return, why is it that we can't  
**[0:13:43-0:13:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:13:43):**  ever lose any money?  
**[0:13:44-0:13:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:13:44):**  Right.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:13:45):**  The assumption is you can't ever fail.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:13:47):**  You can't ever lose money.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:13:48):**  And the fact is that never happens in life.  
**[0:13:52-0:13:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:13:52):**  We can see that the public stock exchange, the last weeks, which all the models.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:13:58):**  If you want to talk about market rate of return today, that market rate of return is negative  
**[0:14:04-0:14:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:14:04):**  50, 60, 70.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:14:06):**  I mean, that's what we're looking at right now.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:14:09):**  And I was telling Sally the other day that I remember having to respond to the 2008 crash.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:14:16):**  And that was just 12 years ago.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:14:19):**  Are we going to have to go through this every 10 years?  
**[0:14:21-0:14:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:14:21):**  You know, is this the cycle that we're going to see ourselves in?  
**[0:14:25-0:14:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:14:25):**  In which case, I would say the net on that is zero in terms of financial return.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:14:32):**  So what are we really talking about?  
**[0:14:34-0:14:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:14:34):**  What are we really trying to go for and achieve with what we're trying to invest our money  
**[0:14:39-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:14:39):**  in?  
**[0:14:40-0:14:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:14:40):**  I think we need to think about that a bit differently.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:14:43):**  It's interesting you said that people say, ah, ecological capital, social capital, that's  
**[0:14:47-0:14:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:14:47):**  great.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:14:48):**  But it'll be interesting to see a few months from now whether people are so cavalier about  
**[0:14:52-0:14:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:14:52):**  social capital, for example.  
**[0:14:55-0:14:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:14:55):**  I think it really takes a crisis to whack us all in the head to see that there are things  
**[0:14:59-0:15:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:14:59):**  besides the financial world that drive people and the planet.  
**[0:15:05-0:15:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:15:05):**  For example, being in a supermarket and not seeing any vegetables or any animal products  
**[0:15:09-0:15:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:15:09):**  and suddenly realise and think, oh, I might have a farmer nearby that maybe actually I  
**[0:15:16-0:15:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:15:16):**  remember they are selling something directly.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:15:18):**  Maybe I can, having access in the pre-call, we were discussing that being grateful for  
**[0:15:22-0:15:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:15:22):**  having access to food is something we completely forgot because it was always there.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:15:27):**  It always showed up magically, like poof, on the shelf.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:15:30):**  And there was no even a question, maybe the broccoli was sold out once in whatever amount  
**[0:15:35-0:15:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:15:35):**  of years and now everything, at least here in Europe, in many places, is just not there.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:15:39):**  And it will get there and nobody's going to starve, but it's a very strong wake-up call,  
**[0:15:45-0:15:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:15:45):**  not even to talk about the quality of the food.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:15:47):**  And I think there's even one additional part of that argument.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:15:53):**  Like farmers, especially in Germany in the last couple of months, they have really had  
**[0:15:58-0:16:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:15:58):**  a tough time because you had all sorts of groups of people going on the street and saying,  
**[0:16:03-0:16:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:16:03):**  we don't agree with this and we don't agree with that and we want you to do more sustainable  
**[0:16:07-0:16:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:16:07):**  and more biodiversity and things like that.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:16:09):**  And many try to do it as good as they can.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:16:13):**  So I think also a sort of a self-appreciation of the farmers themselves now is picking up  
**[0:16:19-0:16:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:16:19):**  because of it, because people are approaching them in a different way.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:16:22):**  So this has a nice social element on the farmers' lives because suddenly they feel like, wow,  
**[0:16:27-0:16:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:16:27):**  this is actually my business or my job basically is relevant for the system.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:16:34):**  So I think that appreciation that is now arising, that goes into both ways.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:16:39):**  And just to follow up on that, no, go ahead, Esther.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:16:42):**  Well, I was just going to say one of the things that I've heard Sally say is that in the middle  
**[0:16:46-0:16:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:16:46):**  of the country here in the US, in the Midwest, most farmers don't grow food for people.  
**[0:16:52-0:17:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:16:52):**  A lot of that is for animal feed or export or fuel, highly manufactured food-like products,  
**[0:17:02-0:17:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:17:02):**  ingredients, but not actual food.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:17:04):**  And so it's interesting now in this time for people to have to think about, well, how can  
**[0:17:10-0:17:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:17:10):**  I get closer to the source of my food to be able to even just get it?  
**[0:17:16-0:17:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:17:16):**  So I can't go to the store and get eggs because they're all gone, but hens lay eggs every  
**[0:17:23-0:17:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:17:23):**  day.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:17:25):**  So then it makes me think, where are their hens laying eggs and where can I go find them?  
**[0:17:29-0:17:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:17:29):**  And so it suddenly starts me thinking now, where does that actually happen?  
**[0:17:34-0:17:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:17:34):**  And how can I get closer to that source?  
**[0:17:36-0:17:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:17:36):**  Yeah, I mean, I'm very curious how much of this is going to stick and how much of this  
**[0:17:41-0:17:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:17:41):**  interest and hopefully, let's say through great taste and great experiences with local  
**[0:17:47-0:17:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:17:47):**  farmers or with your local farmers, because whatever local you can find, some of that  
**[0:17:51-0:17:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:17:51):**  will stick and create a stronger connection.  
**[0:17:54-0:17:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:17:54):**  To come back, you mentioned, I wrote down the word flexibility.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:17:58):**  You can build that into something you said.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:18:01):**  Do you have any experiences, because the flexibility in terms of in times of this enormous shocks,  
**[0:18:07-0:18:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:18:07):**  which we'll see more often than happen more often, seems to be very, very important in  
**[0:18:11-0:18:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:18:11):**  finance, but seems to be very missing usually.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:18:15):**  You said, yeah, but actually, you can easily, I don't think you said easily, you can build  
**[0:18:18-0:18:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:18:18):**  that in.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:18:19):**  Do you have any examples of where the flexibility has been built in into the investments you've  
**[0:18:23-0:18:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:18:23):**  made to basically put you as an investor on the same side as the entrepreneur farmer instead  
**[0:18:29-0:18:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:18:29):**  of just on the other side of the table?  
**[0:18:31-0:18:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:18:31):**  Sure.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:18:32):**  I mean, we look very closely at cash flow.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:18:37):**  Many times when we're doing a loan, particularly, I'm looking very closely at cash flow.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:18:43):**  I will build in certain structures that make sense for that cash flow.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:18:48):**  Sometimes I'll say, hey, it looks like based on your projections, you won't be able to  
**[0:18:53-0:18:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:18:53):**  make any payments to us for the first 12 or 18 months, because you're going through an  
**[0:18:58-0:19:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:18:58):**  investment period, you're not going to be making any money, there's not going to be  
**[0:19:01-0:19:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:19:01):**  any cash flow.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:19:03):**  We'll just give you a bit of a grace period.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:19:05):**  Sometimes I'll pad it.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:19:08):**  You say it's 12 months, I might say it's 15 or 18 months, just to give you a little bit  
**[0:19:12-0:19:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:19:12):**  of extra leeway because always the unexpected happens.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:19:18):**  In some cases, particularly with farmers, they're very seasonal.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:19:23):**  You can pay me twice a year in July and December or whatever it might be according to their  
**[0:19:29-0:19:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:19:29):**  production schedule.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:19:33):**  Or if it makes sense, there's one lump payment per year, depending on the nature of their  
**[0:19:38-0:19:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:19:38):**  business and how they're doing.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:19:40):**  We try to build as much of that flexibility in as possible from the outset.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:19:45):**  But a lot of our flexibility actually comes after we've made the loan or the investment,  
**[0:19:51-0:19:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:19:51):**  where we said, okay, things have not turned out the way that we thought it would, but  
**[0:19:55-0:20:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:19:55):**  let's reassess and let's renegotiate the terms of this loan.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:20:01):**  We're in that relationship, we're in that communication with the entrepreneurs and trying  
**[0:20:05-0:20:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:20:05):**  to make it work as best for them as possible.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:20:09):**  Do you see that as a as a motive of operating that everyone should do?  
**[0:20:15-0:20:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:20:15):**  Or is it because we're so much in the pioneering phase that it does require a very specific  
**[0:20:24-0:20:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:20:24):**  way on every case?  
**[0:20:26-0:20:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:20:26):**  At some point, is it going to be more standardized?  
**[0:20:28-0:20:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:20:28):**  If we want to use the word again, scale or replicate, there's over 100,000 of farmers,  
**[0:20:34-0:20:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:20:34):**  how would that work in the future?  
**[0:20:36-0:20:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:20:36):**  Are they going to be standard flexible, which is a contradiction?  
**[0:20:39-0:20:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:20:39):**  How do we do that with a lot of these individual cases, which are very different?  
**[0:20:42-0:20:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:20:42):**  Maybe there are going to be a lot of Midwest farmers knocking on your door in the next  
**[0:20:46-0:20:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:20:46):**  weeks because they want to switch from fuel to something to food.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:20:50):**  And they're going to all require a different approach.  
**[0:20:52-0:21:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:20:52):**  Yeah, I would hope that we could figure out some kind of standard flexibility, if that's  
**[0:21:00-0:21:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:21:00):**  not an oxymoron.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:21:01):**  But yeah, I think what it really just takes is not trying to fit in a box all the time.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:21:10):**  It actually takes a mindset of thinking outside the box.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:21:14):**  And I think we need more people who can think that way.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:21:19):**  So I'm actually part of, I think going on its third year initiative called the Integrated  
**[0:21:24-0:21:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:21:24):**  Capital Institute that was started by RSF to basically cultivate more people who can  
**[0:21:31-0:21:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:21:31):**  think differently about financing and financing structures.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:21:35):**  So hopefully we'll brainwash enough investors to start thinking in this way.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:21:41):**  Inspire, inspire.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:21:42):**  Okay, inspire.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:21:43):**  I mean, I think one of the issues, if you look at the Midwest is so there is all this  
**[0:21:49-0:21:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:21:49):**  variability, particularly in farming.  
**[0:21:51-0:21:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:21:51):**  And what we did at starting in the Great Depression, right, was we put federal programs in place  
**[0:21:56-0:21:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:21:56):**  to even all of that out.  
**[0:21:58-0:22:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:21:58):**  So we put in crop insurance and we put in crop subsidies and they are flexible, right?  
**[0:22:03-0:22:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:22:03):**  Your crop insurance kicks in if your crop is destroyed by hail.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:22:07):**  But what it allowed is it allowed the finance system to become completely inflexible because  
**[0:22:11-0:22:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:22:11):**  they had this sort of base guaranteed return in agriculture.  
**[0:22:15-0:22:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:22:15):**  And so societally, we took all of that risk and we still do through crop insurance.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:22:21):**  So it's not like the risk is not there for those bankers who are inflexible.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:22:25):**  They've just, we've come up as a way to minimize their risk and to make things look  
**[0:22:29-0:22:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:22:29):**  not risky, which really are.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:22:32):**  And so I guess the question is just who's going to take the risk going forward?  
**[0:22:36-0:22:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:22:36):**  Yeah, we removed it.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:22:38):**  Right.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:22:39):**  Yeah.  
**[0:22:40-0:22:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:22:40):**  Yeah, that's a great point, actually.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:22:42):**  And I think it's so important to have those kind of examples because the kind of language  
**[0:22:46-0:22:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:22:46):**  that you use in the story that you tell is such a huge part of developing or basically  
**[0:22:53-0:23:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:22:53):**  inspiring people to go or follow you or are open to being part of that process.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:23:00):**  So I think that was great.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:23:03):**  One thing I also wanted to just have an opinion of you guys is a problem that I'm being seeing  
**[0:23:10-0:23:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:23:10):**  here in Germany at least is that we have a huge lack of independency.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:23:16):**  So there's all the farmers are already stuck in the system.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:23:22):**  They have made huge investments.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:23:24):**  They have done a big stable.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:23:25):**  They have done this.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:23:26):**  They have done that.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:23:27):**  They are very specialized.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:23:29):**  So getting out of the system is one thing.  
**[0:23:33-0:23:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:23:33):**  It depends on where you are, if you can do it or can't, or if it will take a bit longer  
**[0:23:38-0:23:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:23:38):**  or a bit less.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:23:39):**  But also going out there through additional investments, through additional debt is always  
**[0:23:45-0:23:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:23:45):**  difficult in a way because they already have a lot of debt.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:23:49):**  They don't have a good cash flow.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:23:51):**  They are already in huge investment processes or spheres.  
**[0:23:56-0:24:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:23:56):**  So I think finding and building independency for farmers, I think is for me one of the  
**[0:24:02-0:24:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:24:02):**  key tasks or key things that we have to make sure of.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:24:08):**  And the question is, how do we get there if the cash flow is low, if debt is high, and  
**[0:24:13-0:24:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:24:13):**  you don't want to make them any more investments?  
**[0:24:16-0:24:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:24:16):**  So any thoughts on that situation?  
**[0:24:19-0:24:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:24:19):**  Well, it's a question that we think about quite a bit because we need more farmers to  
**[0:24:25-0:24:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:24:25):**  transition to regenerative practices.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:24:27):**  And we frankly find, to your experience, Benedict, that farmers are stuck.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:24:33):**  They're very stuck in the current system that they're in.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:24:36):**  They're stuck with the types of subsidies and crop insurance and existing debt that  
**[0:24:42-0:24:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:24:42):**  they have around this.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:24:44):**  We haven't yet sort of thought about how to address existing debt.  
**[0:24:48-0:24:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:24:48):**  But one of the things that I have found in talking to farmers who are doing regenerative  
**[0:24:52-0:24:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:24:52):**  practices, if they haven't been doing it from the beginning, it took a major crisis for  
**[0:24:57-0:25:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:24:57):**  them to change their practices.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:25:00):**  They essentially went bankrupt, right?  
**[0:25:03-0:25:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:25:03):**  In which case, when you go bankrupt, you discharge your obligations.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:25:08):**  And in a way, you're able to wipe the slate clean and start over.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:25:11):**  But many of those folks faced that situation.  
**[0:25:14-0:25:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:25:14):**  And that allowed them and gave them the freedom to change.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:25:17):**  It also sort of forced their hand to think about things differently.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:25:21):**  So we've been thinking about and experimenting with just conversations with partners in different  
**[0:25:27-0:25:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:25:27):**  regions around how can we help farmers so stuck in the traditional paradigm start to  
**[0:25:33-0:25:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:25:33):**  move.  
**[0:25:34-0:25:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:25:34):**  And one of the things that we've been doing on the philanthropic side of our work is funding  
**[0:25:40-0:25:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:25:40):**  some work around a new crop insurance product.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:25:44):**  So could there be crop insurance for folks who are doing things differently, who are  
**[0:25:49-0:25:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:25:49):**  implementing what we call conservation practices, who are cover cropping and building diversity  
**[0:25:54-0:25:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:25:54):**  into their rotations and reducing tillage and things like that.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:25:59):**  So what if we could build something in the existing subsidy market that would reward  
**[0:26:04-0:26:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:26:04):**  practices that are more regenerative to help people make that transition?  
**[0:26:08-0:26:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:26:08):**  So there are things like that that we're talking to some folks about and trying to put a little  
**[0:26:12-0:26:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:26:12):**  bit of money towards as well.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:26:14):**  I think the elephant in the room is always the general financial situation of farmers.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:26:19):**  There's an economist named Ken Meador who works in the United States.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:26:22):**  And I first saw him a few years ago.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:26:24):**  And he basically said that the return on investment for farming in the United States is negative.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:26:28):**  Look at any state, look at any county, look at the entire country.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:26:32):**  It's all negative.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:26:33):**  So I sometimes get snarky when people say, but how will you make money practicing regenerative  
**[0:26:37-0:26:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:26:37):**  agriculture?  
**[0:26:38-0:26:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:26:38):**  It's like, I don't know, the same way everybody else does.  
**[0:26:42-0:26:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:26:42):**  I always joke, but it's not a joke.  
**[0:26:44-0:26:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:26:44):**  Like find me a profitable, for sure I'm getting emails now, but find me a profitable farmer  
**[0:26:49-0:26:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:26:49):**  without, in this case in Europe, the subsidy system or some kind of outside payment coming  
**[0:26:54-0:27:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:26:54):**  in or a partner working off farm and looking at the number of hours that go into it.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:27:01):**  We have this illusion, I think you're absolutely right, that the extractive guys and girls  
**[0:27:06-0:27:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:27:06):**  are making so much money and we have to compete with that.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:27:09):**  No, it's actually an illusion of return that is not there, but unfortunately it's the story  
**[0:27:14-0:27:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:27:14):**  that we keep telling ourselves that the extractive version is generating so much returns.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:27:18):**  Yes, for the input companies, but not necessarily for the farmers or probably necessarily not  
**[0:27:23-0:27:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:27:23):**  for the farmers.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:27:24):**  I think the other part of that illusion that's helping investors not be able to see this  
**[0:27:27-0:27:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:27:27):**  is the price of land.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:27:29):**  So you're a REIT, a real estate investment trust.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:27:32):**  You invest in agricultural land and you make a ton of money.  
**[0:27:34-0:27:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:27:34):**  That's just because the underlying value of the land, mostly around speculation went up.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:27:38):**  It's not because you made a ton of money farming.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:27:41):**  It's completely disconnected from the production value or the potential production of the land.  
**[0:27:46-0:27:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:27:46):**  Yeah, I mean, Sally, because you mentioned it, that whole discussion on how do we actually  
**[0:27:53-0:27:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:27:53):**  treat the land and who are we actually, supposedly, meant to own land, does that actually work?  
**[0:27:59-0:28:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:27:59):**  Is land not a public good and we're like the shepherds of it?  
**[0:28:04-0:28:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:28:04):**  That whole financing part, how can we get young people or how can we get any people  
**[0:28:08-0:28:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:28:08):**  really who want to own the land, work the land, get in touch with it, build that relationship,  
**[0:28:14-0:28:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:28:14):**  that trust, grow food?  
**[0:28:16-0:28:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:28:16):**  This is such a big part of that whole discussion because land prices today are so high, you  
**[0:28:22-0:28:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:28:22):**  cannot buy it if you're a farmer.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:28:23):**  There is just no way.  
**[0:28:24-0:28:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:28:24):**  So how can we solve that?  
**[0:28:28-0:28:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:28:28):**  That's really tough and it's such a fundamental question.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:28:31):**  Yeah, I'm speechless on that one.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:28:34):**  Don't say that.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:28:35):**  Come on.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:28:36):**  I mean, I think there are some local solutions to that.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:28:41):**  For example, I think that in California, there's a tremendous amount of public land and there's  
**[0:28:45-0:28:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:28:45):**  a tremendous amount of conservation land, at least all over the United States.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:28:50):**  That has been conserved and turned no longer working landscapes in a lot of cases.  
**[0:28:57-0:29:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:28:57):**  One first step, hopefully, that we're working on in California with a number of partners  
**[0:29:01-0:29:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:29:01):**  is to turn that public land back into working landscapes to change this notion of conserving,  
**[0:29:07-0:29:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:29:07):**  which means closing the gate and kicking the people off and thinking more about that land,  
**[0:29:11-0:29:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:29:11):**  which is publicly owned for the public good, for the public benefit, differently.  
**[0:29:15-0:29:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:29:15):**  Now that's a pretty specific solution depending on where you are, but I think that does have  
**[0:29:20-0:29:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:29:20):**  potential in some places to change the thinking around that.  
**[0:29:24-0:29:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:29:24):**  Yeah, and I think there's a lot of work being done on the ownership discussion on trusts,  
**[0:29:29-0:29:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:29:29):**  on when retirement comes and how to then take the land off the market instead of selling  
**[0:29:35-0:29:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:29:35):**  it for speculation and making sure it's then governed in a different way and basically  
**[0:29:42-0:29:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:29:42):**  never to be sold again, but still obviously farmed very regeneratively, which is a very  
**[0:29:46-0:29:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:29:46):**  difficult and long process, but very interesting as more of that land comes as long as it's  
**[0:29:52-0:29:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:29:52):**  governed and managed well, obviously.  
**[0:29:54-0:29:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:29:54):**  But it's a very tricky one and some people call it the huge bubble as most of the land  
**[0:29:59-0:30:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:29:59):**  is used for fuel and for feed, not for food.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:30:02):**  If that collapses at some point, what will happen with all that land?  
**[0:30:06-0:30:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:30:06):**  So there's also the notion and the illusion of, I see many people keep buying land and  
**[0:30:10-0:30:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:30:10):**  sort of imagine it will always go up.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:30:13):**  I mean, nothing will always go up.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:30:14):**  So there's gotta be a shock on that.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:30:16):**  I don't know where it comes from.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:30:17):**  Could be fake meat, could be wherever, but the notion that the land prices will always  
**[0:30:22-0:30:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:30:22):**  go up is also, I think, a very tricky way to build your fund thesis or something like  
**[0:30:28-0:30:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:30:28):**  that.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:30:29):**  Clearly the problem is not that there's money.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:30:30):**  What did Impossible Foods raise $500 million last week?  
**[0:30:34-0:30:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:30:34):**  Wow, I missed that.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:30:36):**  What's the probability?  
**[0:30:37-0:30:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:30:37):**  There's enough money here.  
**[0:30:40-0:30:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:30:40):**  That being said, Esther, I have a question with that in that regard as well, because  
**[0:30:45-0:30:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:30:45):**  have you had any contact or is there any movement with regards to reinsurance companies in the  
**[0:30:51-0:30:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:30:51):**  US?  
**[0:30:52-0:30:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:30:52):**  Because those companies have all the risk, right?  
**[0:30:55-0:31:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:30:55):**  If there's anyone really thinking progressively about health, public health, about soil, about  
**[0:31:00-0:31:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:31:00):**  climate, I mean, it's the reassurance companies, right?  
**[0:31:03-0:31:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:31:03):**  And they have money, right?  
**[0:31:06-0:31:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:31:06):**  They have capital.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:31:07):**  So I was wondering, is there not an argument to basically start a discussion with them  
**[0:31:11-0:31:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:31:11):**  as well and say, look, guys, if you want to be somehow on top of the risk that is going  
**[0:31:16-0:31:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:31:16):**  to come, let's talk about land use.  
**[0:31:19-0:31:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:31:19):**  So any thoughts on that?  
**[0:31:21-0:31:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:31:21):**  Any movement there in the US?  
**[0:31:23-0:31:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:31:23):**  I have not seen any movement on that particular front.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:31:26):**  I think where we're starting to see some movement is on the human health side.  
**[0:31:31-0:31:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:31:31):**  So the health insurance carriers are starting to see that preventive care is a huge cost  
**[0:31:38-0:31:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:31:38):**  savings.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:31:39):**  And so to the extent that they can help people eat healthier, to the extent that they can  
**[0:31:43-0:31:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:31:43):**  give them access to more nutrient dense foods, it seems worthwhile to them.  
**[0:31:48-0:31:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:31:48):**  So there are some health insurance companies here in the US that are starting to think  
**[0:31:52-0:31:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:31:52):**  about the connection to food and how it's produced.  
**[0:31:56-0:32:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:31:56):**  We also have been in touch with some people in the medical field, and particularly people  
**[0:32:04-0:32:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:32:04):**  in the medical field who work with farm workers.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:32:07):**  They're very concerned about their health and about the environmental conditions that  
**[0:32:10-0:32:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:32:10):**  they find themselves in.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:32:13):**  Oftentimes they're very toxic, depending on the kinds of chemicals that are being used  
**[0:32:17-0:32:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:32:17):**  on those farms.  
**[0:32:18-0:32:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:32:18):**  And so I think from the medical health perspective, we are starting to see some movement.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:32:22):**  And that's where it's happening.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:32:24):**  I'm not really seeing it happen in the mainstream insurance industry yet.  
**[0:32:29-0:32:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:32:29):**  Very interesting.  
**[0:32:31-0:32:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:32:31):**  And I actually want to ask a question to Benedict because Esther brought up a nice one.  
**[0:32:35-0:32:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:32:35):**  So what does going faster and scale mean to you?  
**[0:32:38-0:32:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:32:38):**  And we've had those discussions in our first interview, which I will also link below, with  
**[0:32:44-0:32:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:32:44):**  your vision, obviously, for the farm and for the estate as a platform.  
**[0:32:47-0:32:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:32:47):**  But why do we keep discussing scale on the interviews we're doing here and going faster  
**[0:32:51-0:32:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:32:51):**  with your regenerative transition?  
**[0:32:54-0:32:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:32:54):**  Well, that is indeed a good question.  
**[0:32:56-0:32:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:32:56):**  I have to give you that.  
**[0:32:58-0:33:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:32:58):**  And there's a couple of answers to that, to be totally honest with you, depending from  
**[0:33:03-0:33:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:33:03):**  which angle I want to approach it.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:33:05):**  As of now, if you ask me in this particular time right now, it's basically just getting  
**[0:33:14-0:33:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:33:14):**  up the numbers of the cows that we have.  
**[0:33:17-0:33:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:33:17):**  We started with a little group of cows last year to get some first experience, to do the  
**[0:33:22-0:33:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:33:22):**  mistakes that you do, to get some understanding of the movements and the processes and the  
**[0:33:27-0:33:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:33:27):**  things that you need and the risks and whatever.  
**[0:33:30-0:33:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:33:30):**  We've done that now.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:33:31):**  I have a bit of a, or we have a bit of a better understanding of what we're trying to do at  
**[0:33:35-0:33:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:33:35):**  the moment.  
**[0:33:36-0:33:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:33:36):**  But really to get that additional value add, the ecosystem function, get up the soil health,  
**[0:33:45-0:33:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:33:45):**  have the cow be out there and actually help us also bringing down the cost by basically  
**[0:33:52-0:33:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:33:52):**  doing the job that we today would be doing by buying manure and then bringing it out  
**[0:33:57-0:33:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:33:57):**  mechanically.  
**[0:33:58-0:34:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:33:58):**  I would need a lot of more cows.  
**[0:34:01-0:34:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:34:01):**  So I could basically just buy, let's say 150, 200 cows, depending on how I want to go.  
**[0:34:08-0:34:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:34:08):**  And that would be a big step.  
**[0:34:10-0:34:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:34:10):**  And with that comes some investment into infrastructure and building fences and all that.  
**[0:34:14-0:34:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:34:14):**  I think that would be something that would be the most immediate benefit and the most  
**[0:34:18-0:34:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:34:18):**  big step, let's say.  
**[0:34:20-0:34:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:34:20):**  And then I think apart from that, there's a couple of other things that you can do as  
**[0:34:24-0:34:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:34:24):**  well.  
**[0:34:25-0:34:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:34:25):**  Because today, as we are very grain dominated, we have a very tight, let's say grain production.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:34:31):**  So basically deciding to take out some of the acreage to actually have, let's say a  
**[0:34:37-0:34:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:34:37):**  cover crop, a perennial cover crop for the cows to get on there, but then incorporate  
**[0:34:41-0:34:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:34:41):**  that into basically the regime to if I go with, let's say, spelt, which is something  
**[0:34:48-0:34:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:34:48):**  that we actually can earn a lot of money with, then I'm harvesting five tons per hectare  
**[0:34:54-0:34:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:34:54):**  and not three tons, because I have actually managed to increase the soil to actually put  
**[0:34:58-0:35:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:34:58):**  in the nitrogen through the cows together with the cover crops.  
**[0:35:02-0:35:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:35:02):**  These are steps and certain risks that I cannot take at the moment, because we had two large  
**[0:35:07-0:35:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:35:07):**  droughts last year.  
**[0:35:09-0:35:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:35:09):**  If something is happening with this again, it's kind of life threatening.  
**[0:35:12-0:35:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:35:12):**  We have a lot of employees and responsible for those families as well as for my own family.  
**[0:35:17-0:35:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:35:17):**  So these are basically simple first steps in a way and simple, obviously, let's see,  
**[0:35:24-0:35:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:35:24):**  it's complicated as it is.  
**[0:35:26-0:35:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:35:26):**  And then additionally to that, there's a couple of other things that we can do basically,  
**[0:35:30-0:35:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:35:30):**  right?  
**[0:35:31-0:35:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:35:31):**  And start agroforestry systems or rows on huge fields.  
**[0:35:35-0:35:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:35:35):**  We have fields that are 80 hectares.  
**[0:35:38-0:35:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:35:38):**  Thinking about erosion, soil erosion through rain, through wind.  
**[0:35:43-0:35:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:35:43):**  So things that we can do there.  
**[0:35:44-0:35:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:35:44):**  Obviously, the whole machine park that you could adapt to what's more regenerative methods.  
**[0:35:49-0:35:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:35:49):**  I mean, there's still certain areas that we are plowing.  
**[0:35:51-0:35:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:35:51):**  I would love obviously to sell the plow, right?  
**[0:35:53-0:35:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:35:53):**  But first of all, I have to make sure that the people are working with us.  
**[0:35:59-0:36:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:35:59):**  They understand why and they want to go this way as well.  
**[0:36:03-0:36:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:36:03):**  So it takes some time to convince them of that, maybe a new way that they haven't been  
**[0:36:07-0:36:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:36:07):**  used to.  
**[0:36:08-0:36:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:36:08):**  That's really, really critical.  
**[0:36:09-0:36:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:36:09):**  And at the same time, if we ditch the plow and say, well, we'll do everything different  
**[0:36:15-0:36:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:36:15):**  now, we will have a couple of years and depending on the weather, obviously, where we will have  
**[0:36:20-0:36:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:36:20):**  a large dip in the income.  
**[0:36:23-0:36:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:36:23):**  So these are things that you could speed up obviously as well.  
**[0:36:28-0:36:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:36:28):**  So I think it's a couple of different things actually.  
**[0:36:31-0:36:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:36:31):**  It's really a few.  
**[0:36:34-0:36:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:36:34):**  Is that something you hear?  
**[0:36:35-0:36:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:36:35):**  I mean, obviously it's a very different climate, a very different country where Benedict is  
**[0:36:41-0:36:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:36:41):**  operating, but is that something similar you've heard before or a similar approach that is  
**[0:36:47-0:36:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:36:47):**  common also in the US?  
**[0:36:49-0:36:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:36:49):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:36:50-0:36:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:36:50):**  I mean, I think one of the things that we've learned at the Piscinus Ranch is that we can  
**[0:36:57-0:37:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:36:57):**  only go as fast as nature is willing to go with us.  
**[0:37:01-0:37:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:37:01):**  So I think there's a lot of things that we'd love to see happen faster on the land and  
**[0:37:06-0:37:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:37:06):**  in the soil, but we're doing everything that we can and we just have to cooperate with  
**[0:37:14-0:37:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:37:14):**  nature and she's going to tell us how fast this can happen, how fast the regeneration  
**[0:37:19-0:37:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:37:19):**  can happen.  
**[0:37:20-0:37:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:37:20):**  But definitely in terms of investment of things like livestock and weathering some of the  
**[0:37:28-0:37:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:37:28):**  tougher environmental things, I mean, here in the middle of our country, the farmers  
**[0:37:34-0:37:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:37:34):**  suffered pretty drastically the last couple of years because of too much rain.  
**[0:37:39-0:37:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:37:39):**  So they weren't able to get the crops in when they needed to, they weren't able to harvest  
**[0:37:43-0:37:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:37:43):**  it when they needed to.  
**[0:37:45-0:37:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:37:45):**  There was just a lot of delays that they suffered and a lot of losses that they suffered because  
**[0:37:51-0:37:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:37:51):**  of extreme weather events related to our climate.  
**[0:37:54-0:38:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:37:54):**  So those are all things that we're very familiar with hearing.  
**[0:38:00-0:38:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:38:00):**  And I think that, again, kind of like in this time, I'm hoping that my theory around resilient  
**[0:38:07-0:38:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:38:07):**  food systems is going to prove out around local and regional, but I also believe that  
**[0:38:13-0:38:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:38:13):**  in the long term that your farm and your agricultural system will be more resilient to these events  
**[0:38:20-0:38:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:38:20):**  as you continue to nurture and improve the soil.  
**[0:38:24-0:38:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:38:24):**  So that's a theory.  
**[0:38:26-0:38:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:38:26):**  And I think that we're willing to go with people through a certain extent, the tough  
**[0:38:31-0:38:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:38:31):**  times to be able to sort of come out on the other side with more resilience on the land.  
**[0:38:36-0:38:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:38:36):**  And did you see an increase because of these tough times for many farmers in the US, an  
**[0:38:41-0:38:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:38:41):**  increase of people reaching out to you that were getting closer to the crisis moment that  
**[0:38:46-0:38:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:38:46):**  you described before?  
**[0:38:48-0:38:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:38:48):**  Is there an uptake?  
**[0:38:49-0:38:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:38:49):**  Is there more energy around, let's say, soil and region, or are we still too early to tell?  
**[0:38:56-0:39:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:38:56):**  Well, we haven't seen it because the traditional farmers that are feeling like they need something  
**[0:39:03-0:39:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:39:03):**  different don't know about us.  
**[0:39:06-0:39:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:39:06):**  So we haven't been hearing from them, but we have been hearing from the people around  
**[0:39:11-0:39:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:39:11):**  them that do know us.  
**[0:39:13-0:39:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:39:13):**  So people who work either in government or technical assistance or other kinds of organizations  
**[0:39:20-0:39:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:39:20):**  that surround the farms, they're telling us these people need help.  
**[0:39:25-0:39:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:39:25):**  They need to learn more about this.  
**[0:39:26-0:39:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:39:26):**  They need access to experts and to financing.  
**[0:39:30-0:39:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:39:30):**  And so that we've been hearing.  
**[0:39:32-0:39:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:39:32):**  And I think that it's probably too early today to say, here's what we're doing to actively  
**[0:39:38-0:39:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:39:38):**  address that.  
**[0:39:39-0:39:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:39:39):**  But we are in multiple conversations with folks around what is needed to help support  
**[0:39:44-0:39:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:39:44):**  the transition for these farmers.  
**[0:39:45-0:39:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:39:45):**  Because a lot of them, I mean, we're seeing here in this country unprecedented rates of  
**[0:39:51-0:39:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:39:51):**  suicide among farmers.  
**[0:39:53-0:39:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:39:53):**  Just financially, they can't figure out how to make it anymore.  
**[0:39:56-0:40:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:39:56):**  And I think that with, again, the weather events, it's just increased fragility of these  
**[0:40:03-0:40:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:40:03):**  farming operations.  
**[0:40:04-0:40:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:40:04):**  I mean, I think we heard about it in Iowa, for example, when there's all this presidential  
**[0:40:09-0:40:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:40:09):**  campaigning four years ago, that climate change was not an issue.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:40:14):**  Farmers don't want to talk about climate change.  
**[0:40:16-0:40:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:40:16):**  Apparently this year I was in Iowa.  
**[0:40:18-0:40:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:40:18):**  But what you hear is that there's pretty much consensus that the climate is changing.  
**[0:40:21-0:40:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:40:21):**  We might still argue about why.  
**[0:40:24-0:40:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:40:24):**  But there seems to be we're now at the point where at least we're maybe getting a consensus  
**[0:40:29-0:40:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:40:29):**  among farmers in the middle of the country that they have to do something differently.  
**[0:40:33-0:40:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:40:33):**  Well, sometimes I have the feeling that there is so much potential that lies within changing  
**[0:40:41-0:40:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:40:41):**  a routine that lies within innovating on the farm, innovating with the farmers and helping  
**[0:40:47-0:40:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:40:47):**  them also in the transition phase and bringing in young people.  
**[0:40:51-0:40:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:40:51):**  Because all those different problems can be combined into a solution.  
**[0:40:57-0:41:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:40:57):**  For example, I have this really talented young guy from Belgium, and he is deeply into composting  
**[0:41:04-0:41:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:41:04):**  methodologies and all different composting from vermiculture through Johnson Sue and  
**[0:41:09-0:41:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:41:09):**  everything you basically know.  
**[0:41:11-0:41:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:41:11):**  And he would like, and this is something we cannot do, we don't have that know-how here,  
**[0:41:16-0:41:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:41:16):**  he would like to stay here on the farm, basically be an entrepreneur on his own, but on our  
**[0:41:21-0:41:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:41:21):**  farm.  
**[0:41:22-0:41:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:41:22):**  And we obviously would love to facilitate that.  
**[0:41:24-0:41:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:41:24):**  But he would need roughly 30,000 euros per year for maybe two or three years in order  
**[0:41:29-0:41:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:41:29):**  to test those composting forms, to do a compost tea, to apply it on different plots, to basically  
**[0:41:35-0:41:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:41:35):**  do all the research that you have to do on the ground here with the biomass that we have  
**[0:41:41-0:41:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:41:41):**  to afterwards say, look, this is the way that is specifically good for your farm.  
**[0:41:46-0:41:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:41:46):**  This is something you can transition into.  
**[0:41:49-0:41:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:41:49):**  And these are the investment costs and this is what you need.  
**[0:41:51-0:41:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:41:51):**  And then you can basically start.  
**[0:41:53-0:41:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:41:53):**  What do you have?  
**[0:41:54-0:41:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:41:54):**  Basically the proof that has been basically derived on your farm.  
**[0:41:58-0:42:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:41:58):**  And I think this is a model, basically having young people who are also entrepreneurs at  
**[0:42:03-0:42:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:42:03):**  the same time on your farm that basically help you transition into that kind of way  
**[0:42:09-0:42:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:42:09):**  without having too much financial risk on it.  
**[0:42:14-0:42:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:42:14):**  And it's not that much money if you think about it like that, especially if you find  
**[0:42:18-0:42:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:42:18):**  an elegant way that the farmer doesn't have to pay for it him or herself.  
**[0:42:25-0:42:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:42:25):**  So I think there's huge potential to just motivate and inspire and bring in young people  
**[0:42:29-0:42:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:42:29):**  who then help farmers transition.  
**[0:42:31-0:42:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:42:31):**  And I think that's could be one of the many solutions that we have.  
**[0:42:37-0:42:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:42:37):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:42:38-0:42:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:42:38):**  And we have done some grant making on the philanthropic side for some of those kinds  
**[0:42:42-0:42:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:42:42):**  of projects.  
**[0:42:43-0:42:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:42:43):**  I think it fits great with the farm as a platform, which we discussed previously in other interviews,  
**[0:42:50-0:42:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:42:50):**  like how to open it up and really use it, the biomass as a platform and the space as  
**[0:42:56-0:43:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:42:56):**  a platform and obviously the connections and resources and really switching that mindset  
**[0:43:01-0:43:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:43:01):**  from this is a farm with a big gate around it.  
**[0:43:03-0:43:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:43:03):**  That's it.  
**[0:43:04-0:43:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:43:04):**  But it's actually an ecosystem.  
**[0:43:05-0:43:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:43:05):**  So just to be conscious of everybody's time, I want to thank you.  
**[0:43:10-0:43:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:43:10):**  First of all, I always end with a final question, which never is a final question, but some  
**[0:43:14-0:43:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:43:14):**  final advice for Benedict and myself, but mostly for Benedict is this journey on transition  
**[0:43:19-0:43:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:43:19):**  finance.  
**[0:43:20-0:43:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:43:20):**  Is there any language we should use?  
**[0:43:22-0:43:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:43:22):**  Is there any way we can communicate better and more effectively with people that could  
**[0:43:28-0:43:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:43:28):**  potentially fund?  
**[0:43:30-0:43:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:43:30):**  And I use fund in not just investor, but also on the grant side, a lot of the things that  
**[0:43:34-0:43:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:43:34):**  need to happen and we would like to see happening on the farm and definitely using the farm  
**[0:43:39-0:43:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:43:39):**  as a platform over the next years.  
**[0:43:41-0:43:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:43:41):**  Any words of wisdom from definitely the fields you have been operating in for quite a while?  
**[0:43:47-0:43:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:43:47):**  Well, I guess I would just say, you know, I would just encourage you to keep going.  
**[0:43:52-0:43:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:43:52):**  I mean, in terms of financing, obviously, I think the world has not quite caught up  
**[0:43:57-0:43:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:43:57):**  to you yet.  
**[0:43:58-0:44:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:43:58):**  But, you know, Sally and I are doing a lot of work to try to set a good example.  
**[0:44:03-0:44:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:44:03):**  We are trying to inspire other investors and philanthropists to do more of this work and  
**[0:44:08-0:44:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:44:08):**  to do it with the frame of thinking that we're using.  
**[0:44:12-0:44:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:44:12):**  So we're hoping to try to build the field around you.  
**[0:44:15-0:44:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:44:15):**  So to the extent that you can be patient and come alongside, I think that, you know, eventually  
**[0:44:21-0:44:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:44:21):**  we're going to need you and we do need you.  
**[0:44:24-0:44:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:44:24):**  So don't give up.  
**[0:44:25-0:44:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:44:25):**  Yeah, that's pretty much what I was going to say.  
**[0:44:27-0:44:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:44:27):**  And I think the encouraging part is that just in the last couple of years, people are realizing  
**[0:44:34-0:44:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:44:34):**  that things have to change.  
**[0:44:35-0:44:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:44:35):**  I really do feel like that in the world, there's a realization that we have to manage this  
**[0:44:39-0:44:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:44:39):**  land differently.  
**[0:44:41-0:44:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:44:41):**  I think we're still stuck at the yes, we want it to be different, but we don't want to pay  
**[0:44:44-0:44:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:44:44):**  for it point.  
**[0:44:46-0:44:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:44:46):**  But I do think the explosion of interest, the explosion of understanding is going to  
**[0:44:50-0:44:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:44:50):**  make a difference.  
**[0:44:51-0:44:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:44:51):**  I just have no idea when.  
**[0:44:53-0:44:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:44:53):**  But I think if we've learned nothing in the last week, it's that things that looked impossible  
**[0:44:57-0:44:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:44:57):**  are actually possible.  
**[0:44:59-0:45:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:44:59):**  And that if the world wants to do something, we can mobilize an incredible amount of humanity  
**[0:45:04-0:45:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:45:04):**  and financial resources.  
**[0:45:05-0:45:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:45:05):**  I mean, who would have thought the Republicans would be talking about a trillion dollar aid  
**[0:45:10-0:45:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:45:10):**  package in the United States?  
**[0:45:12-0:45:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:45:12):**  So I think we can't assume that because we're here today, we can't get here.  
**[0:45:16-0:45:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:45:16):**  I think we just can't see how it happens now.  
**[0:45:19-0:45:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:45:19):**  There's no rational logical path, but it's probably going to happen somehow faster maybe  
**[0:45:26-0:45:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:45:26):**  than we ever imagined.  
**[0:45:27-0:45:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:45:27):**  So yeah, hang in there.  
**[0:45:28-0:45:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:45:28):**  Yeah, I mean, this was one of the most beautiful sentences I've heard in a long time and I  
**[0:45:35-0:45:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:45:35):**  totally agree.  
**[0:45:37-0:45:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:45:37):**  But I hope you guys realize that by saying that all the responsibility lies in your hands  
**[0:45:43-0:45:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:45:43):**  now, right?  
**[0:45:44-0:45:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:45:44):**  You have to pave the way.  
**[0:45:47-0:45:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:45:47):**  And I'm grateful for that.  
**[0:45:49-0:45:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:45:49):**  Thank you very much.  
**[0:45:50-0:45:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:45:50):**  I think it lies more in your hands, as much in your hands as in our hands.  
**[0:45:55-0:45:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:45:55):**  Well, I won't give up.  
**[0:45:58-0:45:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:45:58):**  That's for sure.  
**[0:45:59-0:46:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:45:59):**  And to have you on my back, it's even better.  
**[0:46:03-0:46:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:46:03):**  Thank you so much, all three.  
**[0:46:05-0:46:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:46:05):**  And we'll definitely be checking in.  
**[0:46:07-0:46:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:46:07):**  Obviously, we're continuing with this series, but also it would be good at some point to  
**[0:46:11-0:46:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:46:11):**  do an update when the dust settles a bit on the NoGrets initiative and see where you're  
**[0:46:15-0:46:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:46:15):**  at.  
**[0:46:16-0:46:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:46:16):**  Because as I checked, it was three years ago that I interviewed Celine, it was two years  
**[0:46:20-0:46:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:46:20):**  ago, actually plus a month that I interviewed Esther.  
**[0:46:23-0:46:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:46:23):**  So it's more than over time, more than due for an update.  
**[0:46:26-0:46:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:46:26):**  But that will be another episode.  
**[0:46:28-0:46:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:46:28):**  Thank you so much for listening and I'll see you next time.

**[0:47:11-0:47:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:47:11):**  Dear friends of the podcast, I'm super excited to share with you the online video course  
**[0:47:15-0:47:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:47:15):**  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[0:47:19-0:47:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:47:19):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  
**[0:47:23-0:47:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:47:23):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[0:47:25-0:47:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:47:25):**  After 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question how to put money  
**[0:47:29-0:47:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:47:29):**  to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011 and recording  
**[0:47:34-0:47:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:47:34):**  this podcast since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  
**[0:47:39-0:47:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:47:39):**  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  
**[0:47:41-0:47:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:47:41):**  How have we built our decision making framework?  
**[0:47:44-0:47:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:47:44):**  What to focus on with the podcast?  
**[0:47:46-0:47:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:47:46):**  How have we picked interviewees?

**[0:49:40-0:49:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:49:40):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:49:43-0:49:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:49:43):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:49:45-0:49:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/31/transition-finance-ep3/#t=0:49:45):**  Before making any investment please find professional investment advice.

**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  
**[0:00:05-0:00:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:00:05):**  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com or in the links below.  
**[0:00:12-0:00:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:00:13):**  In this interview we discuss how to pay farmers for the carbon they remove when going regenerative.  
**[0:00:19-0:00:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:00:19):**  We discuss the issues with carbon offsets and why carbon removal credits are the future  
**[0:00:23-0:00:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:00:23):**  and why regenerative agriculture is by far the most interesting place to start carbon  
**[0:00:28-0:00:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:00:28):**  removal and storage now.  
**[0:00:30-0:00:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:00:30):**  But it isn't enough.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:00:33):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture.  
**[0:00:37-0:00:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:00:37):**  Investing as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:39-0:00:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:00:39):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:43-0:00:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:00:43):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:00:48-0:00:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:00:48):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:53-0:00:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:00:53):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:55-0:00:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:00:55):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:00:59-0:01:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:00:59):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:01-0:01:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:01:01):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:06-0:01:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:01:06):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:01:11):**  In March last year we launched our Patreon community to make it easy for fans to support  
**[0:01:15-0:01:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:01:15):**  our work and so many of you have joined as a member.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:01:18):**  We've launched different types of benefits, exclusive content, Q&A webinars with former

**[0:01:35-0:01:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:01:35):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:01:37):**  So welcome to another episode today with the co-founder of the marketplace which helps  
**[0:01:41-0:01:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:01:41):**  to drive climate change into reverse by enabling you to buy Nori carbon removals so you can  
**[0:01:46-0:01:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:01:46):**  claim your certificate for carbon dioxide removed from the atmosphere.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:01:51):**  Kim Paul Gambo, CEO of Nori.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:01:53):**  Thanks for having me Kim.  
**[0:01:54-0:01:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:01:54):**  And to ask a personal question, what brings, because I think you don't have a background  
**[0:01:59-0:02:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:01:59):**  as a farmer, what brings you to soil?  
**[0:02:01-0:02:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:02:01):**  What brings you to regenerative agriculture, soil carbon, seaweed and everything in between?  
**[0:02:06-0:02:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:02:06):**  Yeah, I would not have predicted a couple of years ago that I would be working anywhere  
**[0:02:12-0:02:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:02:12):**  near agriculture today.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:02:14):**  So my background is I'm in Seattle, that's where Nori is located.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:02:17):**  I've been here for about nine years since I finished school and I studied computer engineering  
**[0:02:22-0:02:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:02:22):**  and engineering management stuff.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:02:25):**  And I got interested in climate change in 2015 and I was really curious why we weren't  
**[0:02:31-0:02:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:02:31):**  doing more to just remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and sequester it.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:02:36):**  So in 2015 I started a networking group in Seattle to try to meet other people who were  
**[0:02:43-0:02:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:02:43):**  interested in this.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:02:44):**  I wanted to learn about the different methods and keep in mind I was coming at this from  
**[0:02:47-0:02:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:02:47):**  a very engineering mindset.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:02:49):**  So I was thinking about machinery and technology and other stuff that we could build for this,  
**[0:02:54-0:02:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:02:54):**  which is certainly going to come, but it's not ready today.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:02:59):**  So in 2017 I got together with one of my first co-founders and we hashed out a business model  
**[0:03:06-0:03:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:03:06):**  that was to build a market that would incentivize people to draw carbon out of the air and keep  
**[0:03:11-0:03:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:03:11):**  it sequestered.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:03:12):**  And it didn't take very long after we started the company for us to realize that the biggest  
**[0:03:17-0:03:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:03:17):**  opportunity was in regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:03:20):**  You remember how that happened or when that happened or where that happened, that soil  
**[0:03:24-0:03:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:03:24):**  moment?  
**[0:03:25-0:03:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:03:25):**  Because I'm imagining as an engineer it must have seemed like something weird to look at  
**[0:03:30-0:03:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:03:30):**  something so organic and so boring because it's not a machine, as soil.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:03:36):**  Yeah, well actually before we even started the company in the very beginning of 2017,  
**[0:03:43-0:03:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:03:43):**  one of my other co-founders and I entered this hackathon where it was a blockchain-based  
**[0:03:50-0:03:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:03:50):**  application that would pay farmers restoring carbon in their soils.  
**[0:03:54-0:03:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:03:54):**  And we're both engineers, we'd known each other from school and we sort of naively just  
**[0:03:59-0:04:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:03:59):**  assumed like, yeah, we'll just be able to build a sensor that you stick in the ground.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:04:03):**  We'll measure the amount of carbon at time zero and then we'll measure the difference  
**[0:04:07-0:04:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:04:07):**  at time one and it'll just be like simple.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:04:10):**  Like we just kind of hand wave on that and assume that that was the easy part.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:04:13):**  Turns out that's actually the really, really hard part.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:04:16):**  So I'd been aware of soil carbon and the moment then I guess was towards the end of 2017.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:04:25):**  We had put our team together, we had seven people working on this and one of our co-founders  
**[0:04:29-0:04:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:04:29):**  is a woman named Alden Donnelly who has many, like several decades of experience in carbon  
**[0:04:37-0:04:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:04:37):**  markets and she put together the first ever soil carbon removal contract back in like  
**[0:04:42-0:04:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:04:42):**  2002 or 2004.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:04:45):**  And her work back then actually led to a lot of the soil scientists that are working on  
**[0:04:50-0:04:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:04:50):**  this today developing the tools that we're using today.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:04:53):**  So like we're partnering with Comet Farm out of Colorado State University to quantify the  
**[0:04:57-0:05:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:04:57):**  carbon and they worked with her back then almost 20 years ago.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:05:02):**  So it was really her insisting like this is where the opportunity is, it's the most scalable,  
**[0:05:07-0:05:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:05:07):**  we have the partnerships, let's go.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:05:10):**  And do you remember, I mean many who entered the space not from the farming side but from  
**[0:05:15-0:05:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:05:15):**  somewhere else, remember that first moment when they visited a farm, a regenerative farm  
**[0:05:19-0:05:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:05:19):**  and they saw that soil potential.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:05:23):**  Do you remember that moment as well?  
**[0:05:25-0:05:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:05:25):**  So I didn't get to go visit farms as early as some of my other team members got to but  
**[0:05:33-0:05:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:05:33):**  we all look forward to that when it does get to happen.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:05:37):**  So it was probably, it was in upstate New York a couple of years ago.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:05:46):**  Some of our friends at a company called Propagate Ventures that does agroforestry were giving  
**[0:05:51-0:05:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:05:51):**  us some demonstrations of this stuff.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:05:52):**  And it's just for someone who's used to working behind a computer and used to working in software  
**[0:05:58-0:06:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:05:58):**  where it's not even like physically, tangibly real, there's certainly a draw to it that  
**[0:06:05-0:06:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:06:05):**  all of us at Nory experience, whether we have ag background or not.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:06:09):**  Just like being closer to the land, to the soil, it feels more real.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:06:14):**  And so can you describe, I mean there are great other podcasts where you go very deep  
**[0:06:18-0:06:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:06:18):**  into the system as well which we'll today do partly and partly not.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:06:21):**  So we'll definitely link some of our deep dives into the Nory system below.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:06:25):**  But for somebody that says I've heard the name but I cannot really place it somewhere,  
**[0:06:31-0:06:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:06:31):**  could you describe briefly what the marketplace is now where, let's say, beginning of 2020?  
**[0:06:37-0:06:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:06:37):**  Because what's maybe different from what you entered with in the competition also what  
**[0:06:40-0:06:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:06:40):**  you launched with, but what is Nory at the moment as we are at March 2020?  
**[0:06:46-0:06:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:06:46):**  So we're starting from a supposition that climate change is a problem of too many greenhouse  
**[0:06:54-0:06:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:06:54):**  gases in the atmosphere.  
**[0:06:56-0:06:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:06:56):**  And the solution to that problem is to pull those gases back out.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:06:59):**  And there are already a number of different methods available, regenerative ag being one  
**[0:07:03-0:07:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:07:03):**  of the most scalable that's around today.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:07:06):**  But none of these are happening at any significant scale.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:07:09):**  So we recognize that what's needed is a financial incentive for people to do so.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:07:14):**  And if we can make that financial incentive increase, then more and more people will get  
**[0:07:18-0:07:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:07:18):**  into this.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:07:19):**  More and more people will start new businesses, will invest research and development money  
**[0:07:22-0:07:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:07:22):**  into developing new methods and technologies.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:07:25):**  So the way that we work is first we have to come up with a methodology.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:07:30):**  That's how we measure and verify that the carbon is coming out of the air and staying  
**[0:07:34-0:07:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:07:34):**  out of the air.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:07:35):**  Our first methodology is for storing carbon in soils.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:07:39):**  So a farmer adopts the practices that pull carbon out of the air like no-till or reduced  
**[0:07:45-0:07:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:07:45):**  tillage, planting cover crops, crop rotations, that sort of thing.  
**[0:07:50-0:07:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:07:50):**  And then they provide operating data to us.  
**[0:07:53-0:07:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:07:53):**  And that data, it's like where their field is located, what they're planting, how much  
**[0:07:58-0:08:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:07:58):**  fertilizer they're using, that sort of thing.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:08:01):**  That data gets run through this Comet Farm platform.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:08:05):**  And this platform is able to, they pull on a number of different data sets.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:08:09):**  And they do soil sample testing around the United States.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:08:14):**  And they're able to take in your operating data as a grower and then come back and say,  
**[0:08:19-0:08:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:08:19):**  okay, this is how much carbon you're putting in the ground relative to what would have  
**[0:08:23-0:08:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:08:23):**  happened if you hadn't adopted these new practices.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:08:27):**  The gap basically between would you have continued your normal daily practice, tillage, monoculture,  
**[0:08:33-0:08:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:08:33):**  etc.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:08:34):**  You didn't because you do XYZ, so we can safely predict to a certain level of certainty that  
**[0:08:41-0:08:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:08:41):**  you are, instead of releasing X, storing X or storing more than you would have done otherwise.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:08:47):**  Yes, yeah, that's correct.  
**[0:08:50-0:08:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:08:50):**  So they provide the operating data to us, we get this carbon number back, and then the  
**[0:08:54-0:08:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:08:54):**  farmer has to verify the data that they provided.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:08:58):**  So if they're saying that, yes, I was growing corn and I used this much fertilizer, then  
**[0:09:03-0:09:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:09:03):**  we have independent third party verifiers who are accredited for other carbon markets  
**[0:09:08-0:09:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:09:08):**  as well.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:09:10):**  And they will check like, yes, can I see a receipt for that fertilizer purchase, or look  
**[0:09:16-0:09:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:09:16):**  at satellite imagery to see, yes, you were growing corn or you were growing soy in that  
**[0:09:20-0:09:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:09:20):**  year.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:09:21):**  So once that's verified, then we issue to the farmer, what we call NRTs, or Nori carbon  
**[0:09:28-0:09:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:09:28):**  removal tons.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:09:29):**  This is really just a certificate that represents the amount of carbon that they removed.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:09:34):**  This is the thing that the farmers can sell to people who want to remove or negate their  
**[0:09:39-0:09:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:09:39):**  emissions.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:09:40):**  And that could be individuals, but more so it's going to be businesses who are trying  
**[0:09:47-0:09:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:09:47):**  to offset whatever their carbon footprint is for their own business operations.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:09:52):**  And then the really interesting thing, the thing that got me into this, and this is more  
**[0:09:57-0:10:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:09:57):**  of the software mindset on this, is it's really more like a tool that you can plug into any  
**[0:10:03-0:10:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:10:03):**  sort of software platform so that you can make carbon removal happen in the background  
**[0:10:08-0:10:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:10:08):**  of everything that people do.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:10:10):**  So imagine taking an Uber or Lyft ride, and at the end of the ride, maybe a sponsor plays  
**[0:10:16-0:10:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:10:16):**  an ad and the emissions from that ride get removed.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:10:21):**  Or you place an order for a product on Amazon, and in real time, Amazon calculates the amount  
**[0:10:26-0:10:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:10:26):**  of carbon required to deliver that to your door and then removes that amount of emissions.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:10:31):**  And we're just making it really, really easy for them to connect with the farmers who are  
**[0:10:34-0:10:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:10:34):**  doing this verified carbon removal.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:10:37):**  There's a lot of impact there.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:10:38):**  Let's start with the verifying bit.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:10:41):**  As a farmer, I wouldn't say obviously, but you would be interested to sell these removal  
**[0:10:47-0:10:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:10:47):**  credits or certificates, but maybe not doing all that work.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:10:51):**  So how big is the chance that you get checked?  
**[0:10:53-0:10:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:10:53):**  Is everybody being checked?  
**[0:10:55-0:10:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:10:55):**  Have you already had these amazing sensors that you were talking about at the beginning?  
**[0:10:58-0:11:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:10:58):**  How secure is that system?  
**[0:11:00-0:11:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:11:00):**  Because you're going to deal with thousands and thousands of farmers to make sure that  
**[0:11:03-0:11:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:11:03):**  this is a waterproof system.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:11:06):**  Right.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:11:07):**  When it comes to sensor stuff, that's going to continue to improve, especially things  
**[0:11:12-0:11:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:11:12):**  like satellite imagery and near infrared imagery coming down.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:11:17):**  The problem is that soil carbon is constantly in flux.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:11:22):**  Notice that I said that we were measuring what's happening relative to what would have  
**[0:11:27-0:11:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:11:27):**  happened.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:11:29):**  You can't just take a static measurement in time and then measure again a year later because  
**[0:11:35-0:11:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:11:35):**  that's not actually how soil carbon works.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:11:42):**  It's constantly changing.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:11:44):**  So when it comes to Comet Farm, that's an open source and peer reviewed tool.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:11:50):**  It's funded by the US Department of Agriculture.  
**[0:11:52-0:12:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:11:52):**  So this is really the US government's best tool and approach for estimating soil carbon.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:12:00):**  So it's pretty well trusted.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:12:01):**  It's been around for over a couple of decades.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:12:05):**  And there are other tools that are coming online that can perform similar functions  
**[0:12:09-0:12:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:12:09):**  and we want to work with them as well.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:12:11):**  So we want to see more of this be developed.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:12:14):**  The verifiers are the ones who are taking on the responsibility for asserting that what  
**[0:12:22-0:12:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:12:22):**  the farmer says is true.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:12:23):**  And these verifiers are already working in existing carbon markets.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:12:28):**  So that in the US, there are about 20 companies that do this already.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:12:32):**  And they are accredited to various different standards.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:12:34):**  There's ISO, there's ANSI, and each carbon registry has their own qualifications.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:12:41):**  We're just working with the same people.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:12:43):**  So those verifiers are responsible for determining how well to check the farmer data.  
**[0:12:52-0:12:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:12:52):**  So they might want to see receipts.  
**[0:12:53-0:12:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:12:53):**  They might want to see satellite imagery.  
**[0:12:56-0:12:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:12:56):**  In general, they probably don't need to go on site because that's where the most expensive  
**[0:12:59-0:13:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:12:59):**  cost comes in.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:13:00):**  And we're trying to reduce the cost as much as possible.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:13:03):**  But they take on that liability for asserting that what the farmer said is true.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:13:10):**  And actually, we met through the customer side, which we'll dive deeper into later as  
**[0:13:14-0:13:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:13:14):**  I purchase my removal tokens last year.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:13:18):**  The end of last year, I did a calculation of my travel and everything else and basically  
**[0:13:22-0:13:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:13:22):**  doubled that and bought them through the Nori platform, which was a very easy process.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:13:27):**  Not being paid to say this, but you reached out straight away and we started discussing  
**[0:13:31-0:13:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:13:31):**  for the podcast.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:13:32):**  In terms of customers, can you explain...  
**[0:13:37-0:13:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:13:37):**  Just one question before, because a lot of people would say, yeah, but I'm already buying  
**[0:13:42-0:13:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:13:42):**  offsets which are, let's say, ridiculously cheap.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:13:45):**  What is the big difference between offsets and removal?  
**[0:13:48-0:13:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:13:48):**  I think it's something we have to keep repeating over and over again because the market and  
**[0:13:53-0:13:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:13:53):**  all of us farmers, people in the space, et cetera, need to understand that fundamental  
**[0:13:57-0:13:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:13:57):**  difference.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:13:58):**  I've heard you say it on a number of other podcasts, but let's bring it here as well.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:14:02):**  What's the fundamental difference between removal and offsets?  
**[0:14:05-0:14:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:14:05):**  So a carbon offset project, when you pay for one of those, almost always what you're paying  
**[0:14:12-0:14:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:14:12):**  for is someone to avoid future emissions.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:14:17):**  They're doing something that's reducing the amount of how much they're going to emit in  
**[0:14:23-0:14:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:14:23):**  the future.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:14:25):**  Carbon removal is about removing past emissions that are already up in the air.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:14:30):**  So it's sequestration, it's regenerative ag, it's new reforestation, it's kelp, it's direct  
**[0:14:39-0:14:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:14:39):**  air capture, it's storing CO2 and construction materials.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:14:44):**  Those are not happening at any scale, whereas offsets are.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:14:50):**  So this kind of goes back to the history of how people have just approached dealing with  
**[0:14:56-0:15:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:14:56):**  climate change in the past was like, you started paying attention to this in the 1990s and  
**[0:15:00-0:15:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:15:00):**  then people thought, okay, we just need to reduce our way out of this.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:15:03):**  We need to decarbonize the energy grid, the transportation sector, and so on, and then  
**[0:15:09-0:15:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:15:09):**  hope that it's going well enough at that rate.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:15:13):**  But the problem is it's too late.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:15:15):**  There's already too much CO2 up in the atmosphere.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:15:18):**  So decarbonizing isn't enough on its own.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:15:22):**  We also have to remove over 1 trillion metric tons of CO2 from the air.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:15:27):**  So there are so many efforts underway right now to decarbonize, transition to renewables,  
**[0:15:34-0:15:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:15:34):**  and market forces are pushing things in that direction right now.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:15:38):**  No one is really focusing on carbon removal in the same way that we are.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:15:41):**  So that's why we're trying to put a focus on it.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:15:43):**  It's like, this is the next thing that we have to do.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:15:45):**  So that's the fundamental difference.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:15:47):**  I think removal has significantly more value.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:15:49):**  It seems like the natural next step in the evolution of carbon markets and ecosystem  
**[0:15:55-0:15:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:15:55):**  markets in general.  
**[0:15:56-0:16:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:15:56):**  And I think it's one of the reasons I want to pay more attention to that in the podcast,  
**[0:16:01-0:16:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:16:01):**  because it could be one of those pieces of the puzzle for land users, land managers,  
**[0:16:06-0:16:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:16:06):**  farmers to start to transition quicker if they can get paid for the carbon they store  
**[0:16:11-0:16:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:16:11):**  or remove from the air.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:16:13):**  The price that currently is that I paid as well at the end of last year seems still very  
**[0:16:19-0:16:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:16:19):**  low.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:16:20):**  I mean, it seems very high compared to the normal offsets that I bought the years before.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:16:23):**  But obviously, I'm now aware of the huge difference that there is in terms of impact as well.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:16:28):**  In terms of the true price of carbon, which in some studies is $150 a ton, in some studies  
**[0:16:34-0:16:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:16:34):**  even more, do you see that the price you can pay to farmers will go towards that at some  
**[0:16:41-0:16:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:16:41):**  point?  
**[0:16:42-0:16:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:16:42):**  Or what do you see in terms of price you're currently able to help the farmers sell for  
**[0:16:46-0:16:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:16:46):**  and that future development, let's say?  
**[0:16:49-0:16:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:16:49):**  So this is the econ section of the podcast.  
**[0:16:52-0:16:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:16:52):**  And pricing is a really, really, really important piece of this.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:16:57):**  And we have to start by looking at how has pricing worked in the past, especially when  
**[0:17:02-0:17:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:17:02):**  it comes to offsets.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:17:03):**  And in the past, these carbon markets that have been around have been ripe with fraud  
**[0:17:10-0:17:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:17:10):**  and manipulation.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:17:11):**  And so you can't really trust the price that's come out of these markets.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:17:14):**  It's not really driven by market demand.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:17:16):**  In a lot of cases, it's driven by just government price floors.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:17:19):**  So that doesn't actually reflect what the true price is.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:17:23):**  So the way that we work is we're doing something fundamentally different from every other carbon  
**[0:17:31-0:17:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:17:31):**  market that's come before us.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:17:32):**  And in every other carbon market, the way that it's worked is when someone does an offset  
**[0:17:36-0:17:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:17:36):**  project or any type of carbon project, they're issued these carbon credits.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:17:41):**  And then they typically sell those to a broker who then might sell them on to another broker  
**[0:17:46-0:17:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:17:46):**  or maybe an investor buys them.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:17:47):**  And then maybe someone eventually purchases them and then chooses to retire them.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:17:52):**  And retirement in carbon markets means that you're pulling that carbon credit out of circulation.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:17:57):**  And you're saying this is no longer going to be resold.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:18:00):**  I'm claiming final ownership of it.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:18:04):**  But when the market analysts look at these carbon markets, they're counting every sale  
**[0:18:10-0:18:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:18:10):**  along the way as a sale of a ton of CO2.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:18:14):**  Even though that certificate is just one ton and it's being resold over and over and over  
**[0:18:19-0:18:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:18:19):**  again.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:18:20):**  So that seems kind of ridiculous to me.  
**[0:18:24-0:18:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:18:24):**  So what we do differently is when the carbon is sold from the farmer to the buyer, it's  
**[0:18:29-0:18:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:18:29):**  immediately retired.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:18:31):**  So the NRTs that you bought from us, those are yours forever.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:18:35):**  You can never resell them.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:18:37):**  And we're able to enforce that because it's written on the blockchain.  
**[0:18:41-0:18:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:18:41):**  So this is one of the most basic use cases for a blockchain is a transparent ledger so  
**[0:18:47-0:18:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:18:47):**  that everyone is clear on who owns what.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:18:50):**  But even though we're going to force immediate retirement, we still want a market where people  
**[0:18:56-0:18:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:18:56):**  can trade something.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:18:58):**  Because commodities markets are really crucial to price discovery, increasing liquidity and  
**[0:19:05-0:19:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:19:05):**  investment into a space and helping people forecast what they can earn.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:19:09):**  And if you can't forecast how much you're going to be able to earn from doing this,  
**[0:19:13-0:19:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:19:13):**  then you're not going to start a business doing this.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:19:14):**  It's just like a fundamentally important thing.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:19:17):**  So what we've done is we've separated out the method of payment from the carbon certificate  
**[0:19:22-0:19:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:19:22):**  itself.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:19:23):**  And that's where the Nori token comes in.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:19:26):**  So in the Nori market, it's the middle of March right now.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:19:33):**  We haven't fully implemented this yet, but we will be soon.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:19:36):**  So in the Nori market, when a buyer purchases one ton of CO2, the farmer is going to receive  
**[0:19:42-0:19:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:19:42):**  one Nori token.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:19:44):**  And then they can go resell that token into the open market.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:19:48):**  So we're creating a finite number of these Nori tokens, which are think of them like  
**[0:19:53-0:19:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:19:53):**  gift cards.  
**[0:19:54-0:19:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:19:54):**  And they're reusable gift cards, one token per ton of CO2.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:19:59):**  And it's just going to circulate around the economy that way.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:20:02):**  Whereas there's a potentially infinite number of these NRTs, the carbon that the farmers  
**[0:20:07-0:20:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:20:07):**  are pulling out.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:20:08):**  So the price and how much is going to be paid is going to be based on what is the trading  
**[0:20:14-0:20:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:20:14):**  price of that token.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:20:17):**  And our hypothesis is based on if there is a finite number of tokens and if demand for  
**[0:20:23-0:20:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:20:23):**  carbon removal increases in the future, which to me seems like an obvious no brainer, then  
**[0:20:30-0:20:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:20:30):**  with demand up but supply fixed, the price of the token should increase as well, which  
**[0:20:35-0:20:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:20:35):**  means that there is more and more financial incentive for people on the supply side to  
**[0:20:40-0:20:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:20:40):**  enter the market.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:20:41):**  So I mean, we project carbon prices in the future of $15, $35, $60.  
**[0:20:49-0:20:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:20:49):**  When that happens, how that happens, if it'll be through our market, that remains to be  
**[0:20:52-0:20:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:20:52):**  seen.  
**[0:20:53-0:20:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:20:53):**  We have to execute.  
**[0:20:54-0:21:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:20:54):**  But we're trying to create this system where it's real market demand that's based off  
**[0:21:00-0:21:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:21:00):**  of just like standard supply and demand principles that end up setting price so that people can  
**[0:21:04-0:21:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:21:04):**  respond to that.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:21:05):**  Let's let the market sort this whole thing out.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:21:08):**  And talking about the market, I mean, I think we all have seen the huge announcements of  
**[0:21:13-0:21:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:21:13):**  a number of companies and groups.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:21:15):**  And I think obviously Amazon or Jeff Bezos himself, Microsoft, everybody's going carbon  
**[0:21:21-0:21:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:21:21):**  neutral and beyond.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:21:23):**  I have the feeling that's mostly about offset and not so much about removal.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:21:26):**  Is there like how has been the interest in the last three months?  
**[0:21:31-0:21:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:21:31):**  Let's take the freshest part.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:21:33):**  How has been the interest from mostly the company side of things is more relevant at  
**[0:21:37-0:21:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:21:37):**  the moment than maybe the private individuals like myself?  
**[0:21:41-0:21:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:21:41):**  How has been that discussion on, OK, let's move from certificates of offset to removal,  
**[0:21:48-0:21:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:21:48):**  and which is a different price, but a lot of extra benefits?  
**[0:21:50-0:21:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:21:50):**  How has been the response from your launching customers and let's say the first few months  
**[0:21:54-0:21:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:21:54):**  of this year?  
**[0:21:56-0:22:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:21:56):**  Well, I'll start by saying that there are a few companies who have been making carbon  
**[0:22:00-0:22:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:22:00):**  removal commitments.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:22:02):**  So they're the ones who have done the work and really understand the difference between  
**[0:22:05-0:22:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:22:05):**  offsetting and removal.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:22:07):**  Examples would be Microsoft and Stripe and Shopify and Intuit.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:22:12):**  So Microsoft in January announced a billion dollar fund and they want to remove all of  
**[0:22:17-0:22:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:22:17):**  their emissions that they've ever been responsible for emitting since their company founding  
**[0:22:21-0:22:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:22:21):**  in 1975.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:22:23):**  And that's amazing.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:22:24):**  And that includes like the electricity used for your Windows computer in 95, basically.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:22:30):**  They go to tier three, basically, for scope three of the emissions.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:22:34):**  Yeah, which is that is the right way to think about it is the carbon that you emit is sort  
**[0:22:40-0:22:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:22:40):**  of like garbage and you should pay for cleaning up your garbage.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:22:44):**  So I expect to see more companies following suit and understanding that carbon negative  
**[0:22:49-0:22:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:22:49):**  is where they have to go.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:22:51):**  Yeah, I was mostly referring, I think, here to I think it was EasyJet in Europe, one of  
**[0:22:55-0:23:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:22:55):**  the main low cost airlines that went carbon neutral, at least for all their current flights.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:23:01):**  But then some prices surfaced of what they paid for the offsets in this case, which were  
**[0:23:05-0:23:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:23:05):**  very, very low.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:23:06):**  It's still a good signal because it triggers everybody else to hopefully wake up.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:23:10):**  Yeah, but they definitely didn't say anything about a removal or any of that.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:23:15):**  That's kind of the real problem is that there are a lot of very low quality offsets out  
**[0:23:20-0:23:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:23:20):**  there that have either never been sold or are just being peddled by fraudsters, frankly.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:23:27):**  And so the underlying credibility of the carbon certificate itself is critically important.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:23:35):**  And people are starting to understand that now in a way that five years ago, if you had  
**[0:23:41-0:23:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:23:41):**  asked just kind of any even even a sustainability director at a big company, they probably would  
**[0:23:46-0:23:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:23:46):**  have just assumed that like most carbon offsets are just the same.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:23:50):**  That said, there are a bunch of companies who have been doing carbon offsetting for  
**[0:23:56-0:23:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:23:56):**  a long time.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:23:59):**  I won't name this one that I was talking to, but they've been carbon offsetting for over  
**[0:24:04-0:24:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:24:04):**  10 years.  
**[0:24:05-0:24:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:24:05):**  And they have a way of doing it because if you were doing this 10 years ago, it was very,  
**[0:24:12-0:24:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:24:12):**  very difficult to find and source the projects, you have to do the diligence on the projects,  
**[0:24:18-0:24:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:24:18):**  which could take months, if not up to a year.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:24:21):**  And then you have to try to get them to commit to working with you long term because you  
**[0:24:27-0:24:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:24:27):**  just put in all that effort.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:24:28):**  You don't want it to be like a one off sort of relationship.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:24:32):**  And those companies that have been doing that for a long time, they have all of this infrastructure  
**[0:24:36-0:24:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:24:36):**  built up internally around how they're going to be doing that.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:24:39):**  So they're not, in my opinion, they're not really the best candidates for us at least  
**[0:24:45-0:24:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:24:45):**  because we're trying to simplify this whole process and go to the people who have never  
**[0:24:48-0:24:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:24:48):**  done this before because it's just been so confusing and they don't know how to wrap  
**[0:24:52-0:24:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:24:52):**  their heads around it.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:24:53):**  And we're saying like, look, we'll take care of all that.  
**[0:24:56-0:24:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:24:56):**  We open source our methodology.  
**[0:24:58-0:25:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:24:58):**  We try to be as transparent as possible about the credibility of it.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:25:01):**  We just want this to be as simple as an e-commerce transaction.  
**[0:25:04-0:25:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:25:04):**  In your credit card, you're done.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:25:05):**  And do you see, because logically, at least in my mind, it would seem that the ideal customers  
**[0:25:12-0:25:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:25:12):**  would be in the food and egg space because they would sort of grasp the soil potential.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:25:18):**  But the three you just mentioned, which I'm not saying are your customers, but the ones  
**[0:25:21-0:25:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:25:21):**  that have made specific statements about removal, Stripe, Microsoft and Shopify are definitely  
**[0:25:27-0:25:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:25:27):**  not in the egg and food space.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:25:29):**  Do you see interest from the egg and food space?  
**[0:25:30-0:25:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:25:30):**  Is that something you or is it are actually your launching customers or the customers  
**[0:25:34-0:25:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:25:34):**  you've had over the last, let's say, year?  
**[0:25:36-0:25:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:25:36):**  Funny enough, not so much in that area.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:25:38):**  Oh, man, the food and agriculture industry is fascinating.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:25:42):**  Tell me about it.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:25:43):**  I spent 77 interviews discovering more and more about it.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:25:48):**  Yeah, it is.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:25:49):**  It is weird.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:25:50):**  And so what we're kind of seeing are there's almost like a schism down the middle.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:25:58):**  Some companies are rather all companies in the food industry are interested in regenerative  
**[0:26:04-0:26:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:26:04):**  agriculture.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:26:05):**  I don't think there's any question about that, whether they're small companies or all the  
**[0:26:10-0:26:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:26:10):**  way up to the big food giants.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:26:12):**  They're all making some sort of commitment or trying to push their food suppliers or  
**[0:26:17-0:26:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:26:17):**  their producers into that space.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:26:19):**  Some of them want to have that happen kind of under their umbrella of their own operations.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:26:27):**  And so they just want to specify and say, like, look, if you're going to be a supplier  
**[0:26:30-0:26:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:26:30):**  for us, then you need to conform to these certain types of practices.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:26:36):**  And then there are others who recognize, look, this needs to be managed by an independent  
**[0:26:41-0:26:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:26:41):**  body, meaning someone like Nori, because we're not an ag company.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:26:46):**  We are independent.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:26:47):**  This needs to be independent.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:26:48):**  And there should be other people, as well as maybe us paying for these farmers to do  
**[0:26:54-0:26:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:26:54):**  it.  
**[0:26:55-0:27:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:26:55):**  So there are all these questions in the ag industry around, like, how do we do the measurement  
**[0:27:00-0:27:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:27:00):**  and verification?  
**[0:27:01-0:27:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:27:01):**  And who pays for it?  
**[0:27:02-0:27:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:27:02):**  Is it us?  
**[0:27:03-0:27:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:27:03):**  Or is it some other industry?  
**[0:27:04-0:27:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:27:04):**  Like, if you are a food company, a large food company, and you're responsible for an enormous  
**[0:27:10-0:27:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:27:10):**  amount of emissions, and then you get your food suppliers to transition to regenerative  
**[0:27:15-0:27:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:27:15):**  agriculture, but then the airlines come in and buy all of that carbon up from the farmers,  
**[0:27:20-0:27:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:27:20):**  well, then what are you left with?  
**[0:27:23-0:27:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:27:23):**  Are you still responsible for the emissions?  
**[0:27:26-0:27:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:27:26):**  Are you dealing with your own carbon footprint?  
**[0:27:27-0:27:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:27:27):**  Are you giving away the best opportunity?  
**[0:27:30-0:27:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:27:30):**  So there's a lot of disagreement inside different food orgs about that.  
**[0:27:35-0:27:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:27:35):**  And it'll just take time for that to play out.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:27:38):**  I think there will be several different ways of approaching it.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:27:41):**  So your answer is they're definitely not knocking on your door, as maybe some of the technology  
**[0:27:46-0:27:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:27:46):**  companies are?  
**[0:27:47-0:27:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:27:47):**  Well, another factor is that all of that economic stuff that I just described, like the market  
**[0:27:53-0:27:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:27:53):**  pricing and things, in some cases, they're food companies.  
**[0:27:57-0:27:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:27:57):**  These are all commodities companies.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:27:59):**  They deal with that on a daily basis.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:28:01):**  And so they really understand what we're going at.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:28:03):**  Some of them want to see us just get a little more traction.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:28:08):**  And others are afraid of the fact that our model is built around increasing the financial  
**[0:28:15-0:28:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:28:15):**  incentive for farmers, which means that their own costs could go up.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:28:18):**  So they don't necessarily want that either.  
**[0:28:21-0:28:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:28:21):**  So there are some who are interested and some who are not.  
**[0:28:24-0:28:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:28:24):**  Why would that be?  
**[0:28:25-0:28:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:28:25):**  Why would their costs go up?  
**[0:28:27-0:28:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:28:27):**  Well, we're trying to create this model where the price that people pay for a ton of CO2  
**[0:28:33-0:28:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:28:33):**  increases, meaning the more that they're paying, the more that the farmers are receiving.  
**[0:28:38-0:28:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:28:38):**  So the more farmers who are going to want to sign up for this because they're seeing  
**[0:28:40-0:28:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:28:40):**  there's a lot of money to be made here.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:28:42):**  But if you're a food company and you're going to commit to paying your farmers for storing  
**[0:28:49-0:28:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:28:49):**  carbon in their soils, you don't want to see that cost increase over time.  
**[0:28:52-0:28:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:28:52):**  You want to see that go down.  
**[0:28:53-0:28:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:28:53):**  If you end up being the customer and not just the supplier or not the supplier, basically  
**[0:28:58-0:29:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:28:58):**  the purchaser of the grains or the oats or whatever you're buying from your farmers.  
**[0:29:02-0:29:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:29:02):**  But if you're also the customer of the removal credits, then it becomes an issue if they  
**[0:29:07-0:29:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:29:07):**  double or increase even more.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:29:09):**  Right.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:29:10):**  So as all of these different desires and preferences are shaking out, we'll see how that goes.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:29:16):**  In terms of you mentioned that you might want to see us a bit further.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:29:21):**  Where are you now?  
**[0:29:22-0:29:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:29:22):**  How many I wouldn't say how many customers do you have, but where would you describe  
**[0:29:26-0:29:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:29:26):**  a Nori to be in the middle of March 2020?  
**[0:29:30-0:29:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:29:30):**  Well, we very much see this as a supply constrained market.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:29:33):**  I'm not as worried about the demand side.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:29:36):**  The challenge is in order to quantify this carbon and run everything through Comet Farm,  
**[0:29:42-0:29:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:29:42):**  we have to collect a lot of data and that can get very tedious.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:29:45):**  And I think there are something like 35 different possible definitions for your level of tillage  
**[0:29:50-0:29:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:29:50):**  to enter into Comet Farm.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:29:52):**  So there's a lot of translation that has to happen between the data that the farmers  
**[0:29:56-0:30:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:29:56):**  have and getting it entered into the platform.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:30:00):**  Since February 2019, more than 40 people from all over the world have joined our Patreon

**[0:30:21-0:30:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:30:21):**  agriculture or in the link below.  
**[0:30:24-0:30:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:30:24):**  So we have over half a million acres of committed croplands in our pipeline right now.  
**[0:30:31-0:30:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:30:31):**  We have some large channel partnerships with companies like Granular and Corteva, as well  
**[0:30:37-0:30:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:30:37):**  as Locus Ag, who are committed to bringing their farmers into the platform.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:30:44):**  There are a couple big ones whose names you would probably know but are under NDA right  
**[0:30:48-0:30:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:30:48):**  now.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:30:49):**  There's a lot of interest.  
**[0:30:52-0:30:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:30:52):**  From the farmers, you mean?  
**[0:30:53-0:30:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:30:53):**  From the farmers and from the food companies who want to bring supply in.  
**[0:30:57-0:31:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:30:57):**  So what we're working on as quickly as we can is to better automate the data import  
**[0:31:03-0:31:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:31:03):**  because it's really the data process that's kind of slowing it down.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:31:07):**  Because you said the supply is the issue, not so much the demand, but that would suggest  
**[0:31:12-0:31:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:31:12):**  that the price for a ton removed by me, a farmer, is going up or would go up, which  
**[0:31:17-0:31:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:31:17):**  sort of triggered me, okay, I will fill out these forms.  
**[0:31:20-0:31:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:31:20):**  Like I will figure out how to do that because I can get an amazing price for my tons and  
**[0:31:24-0:31:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:31:24):**  I need to get in ASAP.  
**[0:31:25-0:31:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:31:25):**  Yes, it's not an interest problem.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:31:28):**  It's a problem of operationally, like we have all this interest.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:31:32):**  How do we go through the measurement and verification process with them as quickly as possible?  
**[0:31:37-0:31:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:31:37):**  And then obviously the changes take time in terms of, I mean, the carbon is removed over  
**[0:31:43-0:31:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:31:43):**  time.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:31:44):**  It's not removed tomorrow.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:31:45):**  It's not like you switch on the machine and boom, there we go.  
**[0:31:47-0:31:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:31:47):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:31:48-0:31:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:31:48):**  I mean, in our case, this Common Farm platform only works in the US.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:31:52):**  So for now, we're only working with US based farmers, but we do want to expand internationally  
**[0:31:57-0:32:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:31:57):**  as we have other Common Farm type platforms elsewhere.  
**[0:32:01-0:32:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:32:01):**  The farmers in the US, maybe about 15% of them do some amount of these regenerative  
**[0:32:06-0:32:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:32:06):**  practices.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:32:07):**  So those are the people who are working with initially, people who have adopted at least  
**[0:32:11-0:32:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:32:11):**  some of these practices.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:32:13):**  And then what will come later are the people who haven't done this yet and are seeing,  
**[0:32:17-0:32:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:32:17):**  oh, my neighbor was making money off of doing this, so maybe I should too.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:32:20):**  And do you then compare it, I don't know exactly how Common works in that case.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:32:24):**  Like I've already done a few things.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:32:26):**  For example, I'm a sustainable farmer, it works regenerative in the Midwest.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:32:32):**  And do you compare it to the base case, meaning my neighbor that is not doing anything?  
**[0:32:37-0:32:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:32:37):**  Or do you compare it to my year one or year zero, basically, where I was doing a few things,  
**[0:32:41-0:32:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:32:41):**  and I'm actually increasing the number of regenerative practices I'm using and thus  
**[0:32:46-0:32:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:32:46):**  hopefully probably pretty sure increasing the carbon in my soil?  
**[0:32:50-0:32:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:32:50):**  Yeah, the way Common Farm works is it's based off of your switch dates from that particular  
**[0:32:55-0:32:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:32:55):**  practice.  
**[0:32:56-0:33:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:32:56):**  So if you went from heavy tillage to low tillage, what year did you start doing that?  
**[0:33:01-0:33:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:33:01):**  And right now, while we're in startup phase, we are offering to get farmers incentivized  
**[0:33:06-0:33:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:33:06):**  initially, we're offering up to five years past carbon storage, or if they have the data  
**[0:33:13-0:33:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:33:13):**  to support it, and that can be verified.  
**[0:33:16-0:33:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:33:16):**  But once we get out of this pilot phase, it'll just be like the latest year.  
**[0:33:20-0:33:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:33:20):**  So we still have to know what the switch date was, but we're looking at how much carbon  
**[0:33:24-0:33:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:33:24):**  you're sequestering this year.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:33:26):**  Makes sense, because otherwise I would be annoyed if my neighbor who hasn't done anything  
**[0:33:30-0:33:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:33:30):**  until now suddenly gets on the bandwagon and start, because he or she starts from such  
**[0:33:35-0:33:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:33:35):**  a low point, would profit or benefit a lot from basically doing all the practices at  
**[0:33:41-0:33:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:33:41):**  once, etc.  
**[0:33:42-0:33:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:33:42):**  Yeah, that is an ironic thing in that the more degraded your soil is, the more potential  
**[0:33:48-0:33:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:33:48):**  carbon storage you have, which means more potential earnings.  
**[0:33:51-0:33:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:33:51):**  So basically the pioneers would benefit the least, but they would have already amazing  
**[0:33:55-0:33:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:33:55):**  soil, so that might help.  
**[0:33:58-0:34:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:33:58):**  And in terms of how far, because you mentioned a bit of tillage, etc., how extreme would  
**[0:34:03-0:34:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:34:03):**  you go, and are farmers, current farmers that you're working with, are going in terms of  
**[0:34:10-0:34:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:34:10):**  regenerative ag?  
**[0:34:11-0:34:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:34:11):**  Because obviously there are multiple levels, and you can go pretty far, including all the  
**[0:34:15-0:34:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:34:15):**  trees and the animals and everything basically.  
**[0:34:17-0:34:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:34:17):**  What's what you see now so far?  
**[0:34:19-0:34:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:34:19):**  The farmers I've talked to, it sounds a lot like the way that organic started, which was  
**[0:34:26-0:34:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:34:26):**  you start with maybe 10% of your fields doing these things, and you test it out and see  
**[0:34:30-0:34:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:34:30):**  how it goes, because you don't want to, pardon the pun, you don't want to bet the farm on  
**[0:34:34-0:34:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:34:34):**  it.  
**[0:34:35-0:34:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:34:35):**  So you would take a piece, you take a piece and go pretty extreme between brackets instead  
**[0:34:40-0:34:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:34:40):**  of going lighter over your full farm?  
**[0:34:43-0:34:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:34:43):**  Is that what you're seeing?  
**[0:34:44-0:34:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:34:44):**  It varies, but yeah, that's kind of what I've heard.  
**[0:34:47-0:34:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:34:47):**  And then for us, it's like some farmers are saying, let's start with just a couple fields  
**[0:34:52-0:34:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:34:52):**  that I've been doing this on, so we'll go through the data import process and see how  
**[0:34:55-0:34:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:34:55):**  that goes.  
**[0:34:56-0:35:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:34:56):**  And then if that goes well, then I'll start bringing in the rest of my fields.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:35:00):**  Again, these farmers want to test it out.  
**[0:35:03-0:35:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:35:03):**  They're very prudent people.  
**[0:35:04-0:35:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:35:04):**  So that makes a lot of sense to me.  
**[0:35:07-0:35:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:35:07):**  No, sure.  
**[0:35:08-0:35:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:35:08):**  I mean, just like organic, you want to gradually go into that.  
**[0:35:13-0:35:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:35:13):**  Or if you have seen the recipe book basically to go extreme, then it's more of a calculated  
**[0:35:18-0:35:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:35:18):**  risk.  
**[0:35:19-0:35:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:35:19):**  But I don't think we're there yet in terms of regenerative ag.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:35:22):**  Right.  
**[0:35:23-0:35:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:35:23):**  Yeah, agreed.  
**[0:35:24-0:35:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:35:24):**  You mentioned we're working with Comit, so that's geographically limited to the US.  
**[0:35:29-0:35:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:35:29):**  What does this mean for smallholder farmers in the global south or smallholder farmers  
**[0:35:34-0:35:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:35:34):**  in general?  
**[0:35:35-0:35:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:35:35):**  I'm imagining it's not this year, but what are your plans and ideas to basically take  
**[0:35:39-0:35:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:35:39):**  this kind of marketplace global?  
**[0:35:41-0:35:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:35:41):**  I would love to go into Brazil because this could really help deal with the deforestation  
**[0:35:47-0:35:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:35:47):**  problems that we're seeing and all of the burning that happens on an annual basis.  
**[0:35:52-0:35:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:35:52):**  If you're a subsistence farmer in Brazil and you're faced with either continuing to grow  
**[0:35:59-0:36:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:35:59):**  soybeans and not make a whole lot of money off of it or clear more native vegetation  
**[0:36:04-0:36:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:36:04):**  so you can get past your land and you can make more money off your land that way, well,  
**[0:36:08-0:36:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:36:08):**  it's an obvious choice why they do that.  
**[0:36:11-0:36:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:36:11):**  So if we were able to turn it around so that we could say, look, keep farming your soybeans  
**[0:36:17-0:36:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:36:17):**  and start adopting these regenerative practices and farm carbon as well, and if you can get  
**[0:36:23-0:36:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:36:23):**  paid for carbon, then maybe that's enough where you don't need to clear out more native  
**[0:36:27-0:36:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:36:27):**  vegetation.  
**[0:36:28-0:36:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:36:28):**  So I think this can be much more of a carrot approach than stick approach for places like  
**[0:36:33-0:36:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:36:33):**  that.  
**[0:36:34-0:36:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:36:34):**  And when it comes to our market and going back to the economics of it and the pricing,  
**[0:36:39-0:36:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:36:39):**  we're talking about a single global carbon price.  
**[0:36:42-0:36:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:36:42):**  So if the price coming out of the dairy market is $15, well, to a farmer in America, that's  
**[0:36:49-0:36:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:36:49):**  great.  
**[0:36:50-0:36:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:36:50):**  That's a really helpful amount of money.  
**[0:36:52-0:36:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:36:52):**  To a farmer in a developing country, that could be an enormous boon and could make even  
**[0:36:58-0:37:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:36:58):**  more of an impact there.  
**[0:37:00-0:37:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:37:00):**  So we're really, really excited and interested at the potential that can happen when we expand  
**[0:37:07-0:37:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:37:07):**  to other parts of the world.  
**[0:37:09-0:37:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:37:09):**  But we have to make sure that we do so in a credible way, which is why it's going to  
**[0:37:13-0:37:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:37:13):**  take longer than anyone wants, because we have to be able to do the measurement and  
**[0:37:17-0:37:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:37:17):**  verification credibly.  
**[0:37:19-0:37:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:37:19):**  And can you give an idea of what this $15 a ton means for an average farmer that you're  
**[0:37:26-0:37:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:37:26):**  currently communicating with?  
**[0:37:28-0:37:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:37:28):**  What's the difference in terms of percentage of his or her income?  
**[0:37:31-0:37:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:37:31):**  What kind of difference does that make to someone that has an average farm that is currently  
**[0:37:36-0:37:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:37:36):**  connected to you?  
**[0:37:38-0:37:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:37:38):**  Just to have a ballpark, is it a meaningful difference?  
**[0:37:41-0:37:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:37:41):**  Is it 1% or 2%?  
**[0:37:42-0:37:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:37:42):**  Is it meaning I don't have to work or farm anymore and I can focus on this?  
**[0:37:46-0:37:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:37:46):**  What does it have a meaningful?  
**[0:37:48-0:37:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:37:48):**  Well, they still need to farm because they still need to...  
**[0:37:51-0:37:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:37:51):**  I mean, but most farmers are, I mean, at least they need an off farm job, at least one person  
**[0:37:57-0:37:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:37:57):**  in the family to keep the farm running.  
**[0:37:59-0:38:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:37:59):**  And if you can cut that or other things or children can go to university, I mean, there  
**[0:38:03-0:38:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:38:03):**  are fundamental shifts if more money stays in the farm.  
**[0:38:06-0:38:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:38:06):**  You can see potential for a 10 to 30% increase in revenue per acre, potentially.  
**[0:38:12-0:38:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:38:12):**  Which is a lot.  
**[0:38:13-0:38:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:38:13):**  But yeah, it's significant.  
**[0:38:15-0:38:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:38:15):**  It's not nothing.  
**[0:38:16-0:38:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:38:16):**  That's without growing better ingredient crops or getting a better price for your crops because  
**[0:38:21-0:38:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:38:21):**  you're doing regenerative ag, meaning probably have a higher nutrient density, et cetera,  
**[0:38:26-0:38:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:38:26):**  et cetera.  
**[0:38:27-0:38:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:38:27):**  Yeah.  
**[0:38:28-0:38:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:38:28):**  And like, I'll say again, these are projections and...  
**[0:38:31-0:38:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:38:31):**  Of course, we just have an idea.  
**[0:38:32-0:38:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:38:32):**  I'll call you out supply.  
**[0:38:33-0:38:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:38:33):**  But then there are other things that can help stack.  
**[0:38:36-0:38:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:38:36):**  So in the US, there are a number of different states that are considering grant programs  
**[0:38:40-0:38:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:38:40):**  to help fund farmer transitions to these things.  
**[0:38:43-0:38:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:38:43):**  There are potential tax credits.  
**[0:38:46-0:38:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:38:46):**  And then what you just alluded to, the idea of applying a premium label on regeneratively  
**[0:38:52-0:38:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:38:52):**  grown food in the same way that we do with organic.  
**[0:38:56-0:38:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:38:56):**  Some of the early farmers that we're working with, that is the thing that they are really  
**[0:38:59-0:39:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:38:59):**  excited about, is being able to say that this is a premium product because of the way that  
**[0:39:03-0:39:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:39:03):**  it was grown.  
**[0:39:05-0:39:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:39:05):**  And all those things could help add on as well to the actual carbon amount.  
**[0:39:10-0:39:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:39:10):**  And do you mean they use the Nori platform as a sort of certificate then?  
**[0:39:14-0:39:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:39:14):**  Like look, I have done, or they use the Comet, the underlying infrastructure as a certificate?  
**[0:39:19-0:39:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:39:19):**  It would be on the Nori side.  
**[0:39:20-0:39:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:39:20):**  And that is a potential thing that could happen.  
**[0:39:23-0:39:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:39:23):**  Yeah.  
**[0:39:24-0:39:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:39:24):**  Because of course, there are other...  
**[0:39:25-0:39:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:39:25):**  I mean, we interviewed Phil of ROC, regenerative organic certification, obviously Patagonia  
**[0:39:30-0:39:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:39:30):**  is pushing for that, Dr. Bronner's, et cetera.  
**[0:39:33-0:39:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:39:33):**  What do you see happening there?  
**[0:39:34-0:39:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:39:34):**  We could just play a role in that.  
**[0:39:36-0:39:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:39:36):**  So as a result of going through the process with Nori, the farmers are verifying what's  
**[0:39:41-0:39:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:39:41):**  happening.  
**[0:39:42-0:39:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:39:42):**  So once they've got that verification report, if they can use that for some other certification  
**[0:39:47-0:39:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:39:47):**  or something like that, then we are more than happy to support that.  
**[0:39:50-0:39:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:39:50):**  And just shifting gears a bit, what do you, outside Nori and what's happening now, what  
**[0:39:56-0:40:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:39:56):**  do you see as the biggest barriers for regenerative agriculture and food to really...  
**[0:40:00-0:40:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:40:00):**  I mean, it seems like we're at that breakthrough point, we're definitely at the inflection  
**[0:40:04-0:40:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:40:04):**  point in terms of if I look at the downloads of the podcast and the interest and soil carbon  
**[0:40:08-0:40:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:40:08):**  in Google, et cetera, et cetera, but obviously I'm in a bubble.  
**[0:40:11-0:40:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:40:11):**  So what do you think are the biggest barriers, let's say the two biggest barriers that you  
**[0:40:15-0:40:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:40:15):**  see in terms of Regen, Food and Ag to really have that breakthrough moment and have that  
**[0:40:20-0:40:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:40:20):**  impact that we all think and see it can have?  
**[0:40:24-0:40:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:40:24):**  In the United States, it's honestly the federal crop insurance program that gets in the way.  
**[0:40:29-0:40:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:40:29):**  So in the US, if you participate in this program, you have to comply with certain requirements  
**[0:40:36-0:40:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:40:36):**  that the USDA puts out around what, depending on what type of crop you're growing, you have  
**[0:40:41-0:40:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:40:41):**  to have planted by a certain date each year and you have different things to conform to.  
**[0:40:46-0:40:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:40:46):**  And if you don't produce a certain amount of yield, then the government will help make  
**[0:40:49-0:40:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:40:49):**  you whole to a certain amount and you pay premiums for this insurance.  
**[0:40:55-0:41:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:40:55):**  Well, adhering to those requirements are not necessarily overlapping with the regenerative  
**[0:41:01-0:41:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:41:01):**  practices.  
**[0:41:02-0:41:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:41:02):**  I think that's an understatement, right?  
**[0:41:04-0:41:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:41:04):**  Yeah.  
**[0:41:05-0:41:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:41:05):**  So if you've been doing conventional farming and you're stuck in this cycle of, well, it'd  
**[0:41:12-0:41:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:41:12):**  be risky to do this otherwise, this regenerative thing, but if I do it, then I won't necessarily  
**[0:41:17-0:41:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:41:17):**  qualify for the crop insurance.  
**[0:41:19-0:41:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:41:19):**  And if there's a bad year, like we saw last year with all of the heavy rains and flooding  
**[0:41:24-0:41:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:41:24):**  and stuff, then I could be totally screwed.  
**[0:41:26-0:41:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:41:26):**  So I'm just going to keep doing what I'm doing because the risk to go the other way is too  
**[0:41:30-0:41:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:41:30):**  great.  
**[0:41:31-0:41:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:41:31):**  So that's why we need to be able to create this financial incentive for farmers to do  
**[0:41:37-0:41:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:41:37):**  it because they need bridge financing to make this happen.  
**[0:41:41-0:41:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:41:41):**  And next too, because it definitely has come up a number of times, but I also want to be  
**[0:41:44-0:41:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:41:44):**  conscious of all the listeners that aren't in the US.  
**[0:41:47-0:41:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:41:47):**  What do you see next to the crop insurance as a big, big barrier for Regenac and food  
**[0:41:53-0:41:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:41:53):**  to break through?  
**[0:41:54-0:42:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:41:54):**  Well, one other thing is that if you've been doing heavy conventional practices, you might  
**[0:42:00-0:42:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:42:00):**  see lower crop yields for the first several years.  
**[0:42:05-0:42:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:42:05):**  And that's also very, just take the insurance out of it.  
**[0:42:08-0:42:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:42:08):**  That's a really risky thing.  
**[0:42:10-0:42:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:42:10):**  Eventually, more of your land will be more productive more of the time.  
**[0:42:13-0:42:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:42:13):**  So you will see your yields hopefully increase, but that could take seven to 10 years before  
**[0:42:20-0:42:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:42:20):**  that is the case.  
**[0:42:22-0:42:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:42:22):**  So even then, not everyone has the ability to do that, especially if you're a smaller  
**[0:42:30-0:42:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:42:30):**  acreage size farm and you're not making this stuff up in volume.  
**[0:42:34-0:42:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:42:34):**  So again, it just comes down to the need for financing to help them do this.  
**[0:42:39-0:42:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:42:39):**  And by the way, when we talk to farmers about this, we don't necessarily really have the  
**[0:42:44-0:42:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:42:44):**  conversation about carbon sequestration and climate change.  
**[0:42:46-0:42:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:42:46):**  We're talking to them about they want to improve their soil health and they need a way to finance  
**[0:42:50-0:42:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:42:50):**  that.  
**[0:42:51-0:42:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:42:51):**  That's the role that Nori plays for them.  
**[0:42:54-0:42:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:42:54):**  And talking about finance, obviously, without giving financial advice, what would, because  
**[0:42:59-0:43:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:42:59):**  I see a lot of interest from investors, large, small institutional foundations, but also  
**[0:43:05-0:43:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:43:05):**  private individuals that feel or see that the soil stuff is incredibly interesting and  
**[0:43:10-0:43:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:43:10):**  incredibly important and they would like to invest in it.  
**[0:43:14-0:43:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:43:14):**  Where would you point them in terms of which books to read, which farms to visit, which  
**[0:43:18-0:43:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:43:18):**  white papers to obviously listen to your podcast as well, which I will link below.  
**[0:43:24-0:43:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:43:24):**  But what would be your advice, not on the finance side of things, when you talk to investors,  
**[0:43:29-0:43:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:43:29):**  when you talk to people that want to put money to work, which is the big question of this  
**[0:43:33-0:43:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:43:33):**  podcast?  
**[0:43:34-0:43:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:43:34):**  Well, the number one greatest need is around measurement and verification and improving  
**[0:43:37-0:43:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:43:37):**  those tools for doing so.  
**[0:43:40-0:43:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:43:40):**  So if I were an investor wanting to get into this space and if I weren't going the route  
**[0:43:44-0:43:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:43:44):**  of like literally investing in land or something like that, then I would be looking into who  
**[0:43:49-0:43:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:43:49):**  are the companies that could potentially impact how the measurement of verification is done.  
**[0:43:54-0:43:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:43:54):**  That could be satellite imagery, that could be on the ground sensor development, that  
**[0:43:58-0:44:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:43:58):**  could be existing companies today that are already doing on the ground measurement stuff.  
**[0:44:05-0:44:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:44:05):**  It could be investing in similar tools to Comet Farm.  
**[0:44:10-0:44:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:44:10):**  That's where I would focus is the, just like with any new industry, it's like the picks  
**[0:44:15-0:44:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:44:15):**  and shovels.  
**[0:44:16-0:44:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:44:16):**  That's where the money is to be made.  
**[0:44:19-0:44:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:44:19):**  That's what we need here.  
**[0:44:20-0:44:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:44:20):**  And it's a good bridge to my follow up question.  
**[0:44:23-0:44:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:44:23):**  If you would wake up tomorrow morning and you are in charge of a $1 billion investment  
**[0:44:28-0:44:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:44:28):**  fund, how would you build that portfolio?  
**[0:44:31-0:44:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:44:31):**  How much would you split to certain things?  
**[0:44:33-0:44:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:44:33):**  Would you buy some land and regenerate it?  
**[0:44:34-0:44:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:44:34):**  What would be your ideal portfolio?  
**[0:44:37-0:44:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:44:37):**  What would it be?  
**[0:44:38-0:44:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:44:38):**  I would probably weight it pretty heavily on what I just described.  
**[0:44:41-0:44:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:44:41):**  And I would do that all across the world and try to figure out what are the things that  
**[0:44:46-0:44:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:44:46):**  are most broadly applicable across borders.  
**[0:44:50-0:44:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:44:50):**  And then maybe do 80% that and maybe 20% on actual land projects just so that you have  
**[0:44:57-0:45:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:44:57):**  something in your portfolio that's tied to the people who are your customers on the other  
**[0:45:00-0:45:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:45:00):**  side of the portfolio.  
**[0:45:01-0:45:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:45:01):**  But it really does come down to, like in the US, if USDA could increase funding for the  
**[0:45:07-0:45:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:45:07):**  research that Common Farm does, and if they could triple the amount of soil sample sites  
**[0:45:13-0:45:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:45:13):**  as part of this reference network, that would have an enormous impact on precision and reducing  
**[0:45:20-0:45:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:45:20):**  that error.  
**[0:45:21-0:45:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:45:21):**  Okay, let's dive a bit deeper into the error potential, the margin.  
**[0:45:25-0:45:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:45:25):**  So if they would be able to do three times as many soil samples, basically the system  
**[0:45:30-0:45:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:45:30):**  would get exponentially better than it currently, the model would bet a lot better, right?  
**[0:45:35-0:45:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:45:35):**  Yes.  
**[0:45:36-0:45:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:45:36):**  And then I would be able to much better predict how much I'm actually storing as a very advanced  
**[0:45:41-0:45:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:45:41):**  regenerative farmer because I have my holistic grazing and all my trees propagate and et  
**[0:45:45-0:45:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:45:45):**  cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:45:46-0:45:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:45:46):**  And it will be much better at predicting in my specific circumstances in this specific  
**[0:45:50-0:45:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:45:50):**  town, in this specific place where I am in, let's say the Midwest, instead of being upstate  
**[0:45:55-0:45:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:45:55):**  New York or instead of being in California.  
**[0:45:57-0:45:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:45:57):**  That's exactly correct.  
**[0:45:58-0:46:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:45:58):**  And the more that you reduce the error and the uncertainty around it, the more likely  
**[0:46:03-0:46:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:46:03):**  that buyers are going to be willing to pay for that sort of thing.  
**[0:46:06-0:46:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:46:06):**  Because you see that that being an issue currently with the buyers, there's still a bit of uncertainty  
**[0:46:12-0:46:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:46:12):**  around and they have maybe got burned before with credits and with offsets and they read  
**[0:46:17-0:46:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:46:17):**  the horrible stories.  
**[0:46:18-0:46:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:46:18):**  I mean, there's a lot of uncertainty I'm imagining there, a lot of uncomfortableness to discuss  
**[0:46:22-0:46:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:46:22):**  these sort of things.  
**[0:46:23-0:46:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:46:23):**  That's exactly right.  
**[0:46:24-0:46:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:46:24):**  I mean, that's why some of these big companies have been doing offsets for a long time.  
**[0:46:28-0:46:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:46:28):**  Like they have whole departments of people who their only job is to do diligence on this  
**[0:46:31-0:46:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:46:31):**  stuff and make sure that to reduce that uncertainty, like it shouldn't have to be that way.  
**[0:46:36-0:46:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:46:36):**  So you would wake up and you spend 80 percent basically on a measurement and global tools  
**[0:46:41-0:46:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:46:41):**  to do that in a much better way and 20 percent on land.  
**[0:46:45-0:46:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:46:45):**  And if you wake up tomorrow morning and you have one thing to change, so you're no longer  
**[0:46:50-0:46:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:46:50):**  investment manager of this one billion fund or 10 billion if you happen to be Jeff Bezos'  
**[0:46:55-0:46:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:46:55):**  fund manager, what would you change overnight?  
**[0:46:57-0:47:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:46:57):**  Like if you could wave a magic wand and you can change one thing in food and egg.  
**[0:47:01-0:47:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:47:01):**  But actually, let's take it a bit more because you are very active in climate change as well  
**[0:47:05-0:47:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:47:05):**  in the broader climate change discussion and you happen to focus on soil for now.  
**[0:47:10-0:47:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:47:10):**  What would you change?  
**[0:47:11-0:47:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:47:11):**  I would really, really, really ramp up nuclear energy because energy is needed to do all  
**[0:47:22-0:47:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:47:22):**  of these things, whether it's running your equipment on your farm or powering a direct  
**[0:47:26-0:47:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:47:26):**  air capture facility or water desalination or anything related to climate change in general.  
**[0:47:33-0:47:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:47:33):**  Energy is super critical.  
**[0:47:35-0:47:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:47:35):**  And traditional renewables, solar and wind are great.  
**[0:47:39-0:47:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:47:39):**  The costs are coming down, but there are storage issues and so on.  
**[0:47:42-0:47:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:47:42):**  I would really, really go heavy into nuclear to get a much, much stronger base load going.  
**[0:47:48-0:47:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:47:48):**  And so why are you focusing on solar carbon as an engineer?  
**[0:47:51-0:47:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:47:51):**  I mean, probably maybe when you started, not so much, but there are a lot of new nuclear  
**[0:47:56-0:48:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:47:56):**  fusion startups going around, especially in the US.  
**[0:48:00-0:48:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:48:00):**  Yeah, there are.  
**[0:48:01-0:48:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:48:01):**  And I'm excited about those things.  
**[0:48:02-0:48:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:48:02):**  But there's also this cultural thing attached to nuclear, which is, I think, irrational.  
**[0:48:07-0:48:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:48:07):**  Why are we doing solar carbon?  
**[0:48:10-0:48:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:48:10):**  Well, because we're a carbon removal market.  
**[0:48:12-0:48:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:48:12):**  We're focused on getting as much scale into carbon removal as possible.  
**[0:48:17-0:48:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:48:17):**  And so carbon is by far the most scalable.  
**[0:48:20-0:48:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:48:20):**  It's also the most affordable that's around today.  
**[0:48:23-0:48:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:48:23):**  And we're riding this economic wave of the entire food industry wanting to move in this  
**[0:48:27-0:48:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:48:27):**  direction anyway.  
**[0:48:28-0:48:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:48:28):**  So it's a perfect storm and makes absolute perfect sense for us to start with soil carbon.  
**[0:48:35-0:48:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:48:35):**  But from a climate perspective, if you just do the math, we emit about 50 billion tons  
**[0:48:42-0:48:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:48:42):**  of CO2 equivalent every year.  
**[0:48:45-0:48:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:48:45):**  And that number is going to keep going up, even though it's been stable the last few  
**[0:48:48-0:48:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:48:48):**  years.  
**[0:48:49-0:48:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:48:49):**  So not only do we need to get that number down to net zero, but then we have to go further  
**[0:48:55-0:48:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:48:55):**  and pay down our carbon debt of all the emissions that we've already put up in the air.  
**[0:48:59-0:49:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:48:59):**  And that's over 1 trillion tons.  
**[0:49:01-0:49:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:49:01):**  So we need to get to the point where we're removing like 60 to 80 to 100 billion tons  
**[0:49:06-0:49:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:49:06):**  of CO2 every year.  
**[0:49:07-0:49:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:49:07):**  And we need to do that as quickly as we possibly can.  
**[0:49:10-0:49:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:49:10):**  If you look at the potential for how much carbon could be stored in soils, in trees,  
**[0:49:15-0:49:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:49:15):**  in kelp, in other more ecological-based methods of sequestration, the back of the envelope  
**[0:49:22-0:49:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:49:22):**  of math says you can maybe do 30 billion tons a year just from that.  
**[0:49:26-0:49:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:49:26):**  So that's not enough.  
**[0:49:29-0:49:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:49:29):**  And the only way that we're going to make up that gap is through more industrial approaches.  
**[0:49:33-0:49:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:49:33):**  So things like direct air capture, carbon and construction materials, and so on.  
**[0:49:38-0:49:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:49:38):**  So everything that I see us doing in the more ecological side, soil, trees, kelp, et cetera,  
**[0:49:47-0:49:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:49:47):**  is trying to pave the way to bend that cost curve down so that the more industrial approaches  
**[0:49:53-0:49:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:49:53):**  are able to come down in cost and become more available.  
**[0:49:56-0:50:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:49:56):**  And I fully expect direct air capture to follow a similar cost curve to what solar did.  
**[0:50:01-0:50:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:50:01):**  So solar was crazy, crazy expensive in the 1980s.  
**[0:50:03-0:50:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:50:03):**  And now it's cheaper to do that than build a new coal plant.  
**[0:50:06-0:50:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:50:06):**  So actually, it's cheaper to replace a current one.  
**[0:50:09-0:50:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:50:09):**  Like the running cost of coal in most, I think, carbon, Tracker just released.  
**[0:50:14-0:50:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:50:14):**  We interviewed Mark Campanella a few months ago already, just released a report like in  
**[0:50:19-0:50:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:50:19):**  most, let's say, large economies, it's not cheaper to replace then.  
**[0:50:25-0:50:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:50:25):**  And it's definitely cheaper to run, but also cheaper to replace, which is a very weird  
**[0:50:29-0:50:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:50:29):**  situation we're in.  
**[0:50:30-0:50:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:50:30):**  And probably lower capital costs will even push that further, depending a bit on what  
**[0:50:37-0:50:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:50:37):**  the solar panel prices are doing with this crisis in China, obviously.  
**[0:50:41-0:50:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:50:41):**  But we're in a very interesting space.  
**[0:50:42-0:50:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:50:42):**  So would you think that it would take 20 years for direct air capture, just for people that  
**[0:50:48-0:50:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:50:48):**  don't know, big machines that suck carbon out of the air and store it in a relatively  
**[0:50:52-0:50:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:50:52):**  stable form, but a big industrial, imagine industrial machines, we're quite far off,  
**[0:50:58-0:50:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:50:58):**  but it's going down quite fast as well.  
**[0:50:59-0:51:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:50:59):**  And there's a lot of interest now in it, luckily.  
**[0:51:02-0:51:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:51:02):**  What do you, is it 5, 10, 15 years?  
**[0:51:05-0:51:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:51:05):**  My guess would be between 5 and 15 years before we reach like really, really big scale.  
**[0:51:09-0:51:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:51:09):**  Necessary scale.  
**[0:51:10-0:51:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:51:10):**  Yeah.  
**[0:51:11-0:51:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:51:11):**  I think it'll go faster than solar did.  
**[0:51:14-0:51:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:51:14):**  Germany basically subsidized solar for the world.  
**[0:51:17-0:51:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:51:17):**  And then China took over.  
**[0:51:18-0:51:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:51:18):**  Yeah.  
**[0:51:19-0:51:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:51:19):**  Then China subsidized the overcapacity.  
**[0:51:21-0:51:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:51:21):**  Exactly.  
**[0:51:22-0:51:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:51:22):**  And so, but those were different times.  
**[0:51:24-0:51:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:51:24):**  But it wasn't a crazy amount.  
**[0:51:26-0:51:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:51:26):**  It wasn't 10 billion.  
**[0:51:27-0:51:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:51:27):**  I have to look at the numbers.  
**[0:51:28-0:51:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:51:28):**  But of course, the subsidies were enormous at the time.  
**[0:51:31-0:51:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:51:31):**  And I'm very grateful for Herman Scheer to push that through parliament at the time that  
**[0:51:35-0:51:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:51:35):**  nobody thought like solar could be anything.  
**[0:51:39-0:51:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:51:39):**  But I think it was like a 10 billion bill or something that they paid.  
**[0:51:43-0:51:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:51:43):**  And some people made a nice amount of money by producing solar in Germany.  
**[0:51:48-0:51:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:51:48):**  But then the Chinese obviously took over.  
**[0:51:50-0:51:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:51:50):**  But they created a market with a relatively small ticket.  
**[0:51:52-0:51:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:51:52):**  Right.  
**[0:51:53-0:51:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:51:53):**  And you just said something that was really key, which was that they were the only ones  
**[0:51:56-0:51:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:51:56):**  really thinking about this.  
**[0:51:58-0:52:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:51:58):**  And times are different now when it comes to climate stuff.  
**[0:52:01-0:52:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:52:01):**  Something changed with the IPCC report that came out in the fall of 2018.  
**[0:52:05-0:52:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:52:05):**  And so now we have populations across the world demanding governmental action.  
**[0:52:11-0:52:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:52:11):**  We're seeing more and more aggressive commitments and targets being set by both countries as  
**[0:52:16-0:52:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:52:16):**  well as large companies who are basically as large as countries themselves.  
**[0:52:20-0:52:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:52:20):**  So culturally, we are at a point now that we were not at when Germany was beginning  
**[0:52:25-0:52:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:52:25):**  that early investment.  
**[0:52:26-0:52:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:52:26):**  So that's why I think that this can go faster than solar initially did.  
**[0:52:31-0:52:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:52:31):**  And when you look at the potential of carbon removal in, let's say, land use and sea use,  
**[0:52:36-0:52:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:52:36):**  I see a lot of different numbers.  
**[0:52:37-0:52:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:52:37):**  And I hear very different numbers from some very advanced farmers.  
**[0:52:42-0:52:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:52:42):**  And obviously the models.  
**[0:52:43-0:52:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:52:43):**  Do you see there's a lot more potential than that?  
**[0:52:45-0:52:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:52:45):**  I think it's a 30 gigaton.  
**[0:52:47-0:52:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:52:47):**  Like because some people say we can remove everything we ever admitted.  
**[0:52:50-0:52:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:52:50):**  Some people say, don't even bother.  
**[0:52:52-0:52:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:52:52):**  It's not worth it.  
**[0:52:54-0:52:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:52:54):**  And you seem to be somewhere in the middle.  
**[0:52:56-0:53:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:52:56):**  But I also think or it seems to be that we only scratched the surface of what's possible  
**[0:53:00-0:53:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:53:00):**  with Regenec in terms of really complex system, really complex agroforestry systems, for instance.  
**[0:53:06-0:53:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:53:06):**  Yeah.  
**[0:53:07-0:53:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:53:07):**  Yeah.  
**[0:53:08-0:53:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:53:08):**  I think both of those things can be true.  
**[0:53:09-0:53:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:53:09):**  So the latest science is people measuring down to a depth of 30 centimeters.  
**[0:53:14-0:53:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:53:14):**  And we sort of think that between 20 to 30 years is the maximum amount of carbon storage  
**[0:53:20-0:53:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:53:20):**  you're going to get.  
**[0:53:21-0:53:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:53:21):**  And then you sort of saturate.  
**[0:53:23-0:53:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:53:23):**  But if we measure down to 45 or 60 centimeters, does that make a difference?  
**[0:53:27-0:53:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:53:27):**  Can you actually keep going further?  
**[0:53:28-0:53:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:53:28):**  We don't really know yet.  
**[0:53:29-0:53:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:53:29):**  We've been doing this long enough.  
**[0:53:30-0:53:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:53:30):**  Hence, you're 80 percent into measurement.  
**[0:53:33-0:53:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:53:33):**  Yeah.  
**[0:53:34-0:53:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:53:34):**  Yeah.  
**[0:53:35-0:53:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:53:35):**  I guess there's also so much uncertainty out there that you're seeing people claiming like  
**[0:53:39-0:53:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:53:39):**  potentially more than four tons, four to six to eight tons of CO2 sequestration per acre  
**[0:53:44-0:53:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:53:44):**  per year.  
**[0:53:45-0:53:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:53:45):**  And that just doesn't really seem to be borne out by good science.  
**[0:53:50-0:53:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:53:50):**  So we try to strike a pretty moderate approach on this thing.  
**[0:53:55-0:54:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:53:55):**  And basically what we've seen and what we kind of expect is that growers can probably  
**[0:54:03-0:54:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:54:03):**  forecast somewhere between half a ton to one and a half tons of CO2 equivalent per acre  
**[0:54:08-0:54:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:54:08):**  per year.  
**[0:54:09-0:54:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:54:09):**  That's kind of the average case there.  
**[0:54:10-0:54:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:54:10):**  And we base our numbers off of that.  
**[0:54:13-0:54:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:54:13):**  We base our potential projections off of that.  
**[0:54:16-0:54:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:54:16):**  Yeah.  
**[0:54:17-0:54:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:54:17):**  And how extreme are their regenerative practices then?  
**[0:54:21-0:54:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:54:21):**  What are we talking about?  
**[0:54:22-0:54:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:54:22):**  Integration of animals or is it just no-till?  
**[0:54:24-0:54:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:54:24):**  Yeah.  
**[0:54:25-0:54:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:54:25):**  That's not with that.  
**[0:54:26-0:54:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:54:26):**  So that's more just like reduced tillage, cover cropping, rotations.  
**[0:54:31-0:54:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:54:31):**  And if you start introducing like holistic grazing and agroforestry and things like that,  
**[0:54:36-0:54:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:54:36):**  then it's potentially the numbers could get higher.  
**[0:54:39-0:54:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:54:39):**  There's just not enough experimentation happening in that space yet for us to really know.  
**[0:54:44-0:54:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:54:44):**  So if I would be a super ambitious farmer within your system at the moment, let's say  
**[0:54:50-0:54:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:54:50):**  Comet isn't measuring that yet.  
**[0:54:52-0:54:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:54:52):**  So I'm limited by what the measurement system, I might be storing it.  
**[0:54:57-0:54:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:54:57):**  I might be storing it in the trees.  
**[0:54:58-0:55:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:54:58):**  I might be storing it 40, 50, 60, one meter down.  
**[0:55:01-0:55:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:55:01):**  But nobody cares at the moment because it's not in the model.  
**[0:55:05-0:55:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:55:05):**  Which is limiting, but a huge potential, like an untapped potential for the sector to handle  
**[0:55:10-0:55:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:55:10):**  that and show the true potential of carbon removal beyond the limited space of Comet  
**[0:55:15-0:55:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:55:15):**  at the moment.  
**[0:55:16-0:55:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:55:16):**  That's right.  
**[0:55:17-0:55:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:55:17):**  Yeah.  
**[0:55:18-0:55:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:55:18):**  That's exactly the right way to think about it.  
**[0:55:19-0:55:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:55:19):**  So you're planning to go beyond carbon because obviously there's a lot of discussion on biodiversity  
**[0:55:24-0:55:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:55:24):**  and water, I would say the main two others.  
**[0:55:27-0:55:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:55:27):**  Is that something you're thinking about looking at considering playing with?  
**[0:55:31-0:55:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:55:31):**  No, we want to remain focused on carbon exclusively because sometimes I have to remind my team  
**[0:55:38-0:55:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:55:38):**  this like we're not an agriculture company and we're not just an ecosystem services market.  
**[0:55:45-0:55:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:55:45):**  We are a carbon removal market and that's going to remain our focus going forward.  
**[0:55:49-0:55:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:55:49):**  And you're waiting for other methods of removal to come into a price range where it makes  
**[0:55:54-0:55:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:55:54):**  sense.  
**[0:55:55-0:55:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:55:55):**  And for now it's just soil and maybe kelp at some point and some others.  
**[0:55:59-0:56:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:55:59):**  No, but that makes a lot of sense to focus because I mean, we all need to focus otherwise.  
**[0:56:05-0:56:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:56:05):**  And I always say final question, but that never happens.  
**[0:56:08-0:56:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:56:08):**  It's always mostly two or three.  
**[0:56:10-0:56:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:56:10):**  What do you believe to be true?  
**[0:56:11-0:56:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:56:11):**  I definitely borrowed this question from John Kemp who usually asks it in a slightly different  
**[0:56:16-0:56:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:56:16):**  way, but I like to ask it.  
**[0:56:17-0:56:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:56:17):**  What do you believe to be true about regenerative agriculture that others don't believe to be  
**[0:56:21-0:56:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:56:21):**  true?  
**[0:56:24-0:56:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:56:24):**  I think there is far, far, far more interest out there from farmers to do these practices  
**[0:56:32-0:56:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:56:32):**  than people think.  
**[0:56:33-0:56:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:56:33):**  I said at the beginning of this that I would not have predicted that I'd be working in  
**[0:56:37-0:56:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:56:37):**  agriculture today, two years ago.  
**[0:56:39-0:56:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:56:39):**  I think that's for many people that listen to the podcast.  
**[0:56:43-0:56:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:56:43):**  But it's been really, really rewarding because farmers are just the best.  
**[0:56:49-0:56:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:56:49):**  And they're tied to the land in a way that I only dream of being, I sort of fantasize  
**[0:56:58-0:56:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:56:58):**  about.  
**[0:56:59-0:57:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:56:59):**  And they care very deeply about the quality of the land.  
**[0:57:04-0:57:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:57:04):**  And they see the relationships that their soil health has to the biodiversity around  
**[0:57:12-0:57:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:57:12):**  them and what they're able to produce and hopefully produce more nutritious food and  
**[0:57:18-0:57:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:57:18):**  that sort of thing.  
**[0:57:19-0:57:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:57:19):**  So especially in the United States where we have this weird kind of political divide around  
**[0:57:26-0:57:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:57:26):**  climate change and carbon stuff, and in a country where more rural voters tend to take  
**[0:57:39-0:57:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:57:39):**  an anti-climate change stance, and I think there are all sorts of other reasons for that  
**[0:57:43-0:57:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:57:43):**  that are totally valid.  
**[0:57:48-0:57:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:57:48):**  They want to improve the quality of their land.  
**[0:57:51-0:57:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:57:51):**  They're interested in this.  
**[0:57:54-0:58:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:57:54):**  I have seen rock-ribbed conservatives who would say climate change is not really a problem  
**[0:58:01-0:58:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:58:01):**  be super interested in regenerative practices.  
**[0:58:04-0:58:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:58:04):**  And so I think that if you take the politics out of it and you just talk about what is  
**[0:58:10-0:58:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:58:10):**  in your own best interest, you tell me what's in your own best interest.  
**[0:58:14-0:58:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:58:14):**  And if we line up, then let's work together.  
**[0:58:17-0:58:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:58:17):**  And I think that that's a far more common scenario than most people think.  
**[0:58:24-0:58:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:58:24):**  But isn't it then weird that some buyer from the outside or some buyer somewhere would  
**[0:58:29-0:58:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:58:29):**  pay even if you don't believe in climate change or say that publicly for carbon to be removed  
**[0:58:35-0:58:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:58:35):**  and stored in your soil?  
**[0:58:36-0:58:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:58:36):**  Or at that point, I'm a farmer, I don't care where the money comes from because I want  
**[0:58:39-0:58:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:58:39):**  to restore my soil.  
**[0:58:41-0:58:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:58:41):**  And even if the money comes from a climate change believer, I'm OK with that.  
**[0:58:45-0:58:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:58:45):**  Well, that's the beauty of markets, man.  
**[0:58:47-0:58:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:58:47):**  Like, you don't have to have the same motivations to do a trade as long as you both feel like  
**[0:58:53-0:58:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:58:53):**  you're getting something out of it.  
**[0:58:54-0:58:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:58:54):**  And you've had a successful consensual trade and the economy marches on.  
**[0:58:59-0:59:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:58:59):**  So we're just trying to make that as easy as possible for those people to do.  
**[0:59:02-0:59:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:59:02):**  And it doesn't really matter what their motivations are.  
**[0:59:05-0:59:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:59:05):**  And this time, a really final question.  
**[0:59:06-0:59:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:59:06):**  How has it changed your food view, but also your eating, let's say, being exposed to agriculture  
**[0:59:12-0:59:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:59:12):**  in this way, which you would have never predicted eight years ago?  
**[0:59:16-0:59:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:59:16):**  I personally, in 2010, I think, I was in college and I watched the documentary Food Inc. about  
**[0:59:32-0:59:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:59:32):**  factory farming and especially when it comes to animals.  
**[0:59:36-0:59:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:59:36):**  And I went vegan for a couple of years after that.  
**[0:59:40-0:59:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:59:40):**  And ultimately, veganism didn't work for me, for my health.  
**[0:59:44-0:59:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:59:44):**  I was getting sick all the time and it was really difficult.  
**[0:59:46-0:59:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:59:46):**  So I transitioned to vegetarianism and then eventually started eating kind of a paleo  
**[0:59:52-0:59:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:59:52):**  diet.  
**[0:59:53-0:59:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:59:53):**  But as I did that, I started focusing more and more on the quality of the, especially  
**[0:59:58-1:00:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=0:59:58):**  when it comes to the livestock, the quality of meat that I was eating.  
**[1:00:02-1:00:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=1:00:02):**  And since then, I'm paying more and more attention to food since getting into this regenerative  
**[1:00:10-1:00:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=1:00:10):**  space now, as much as possible.  
**[1:00:15-1:00:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=1:00:15):**  The thing that I wasn't paying attention to as much was organic.  
**[1:00:17-1:00:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=1:00:17):**  And so now I try to buy organic as exclusively as I can.  
**[1:00:23-1:00:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=1:00:23):**  And we'll probably continue to find other ways to improve the quality of the food that  
**[1:00:29-1:00:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=1:00:29):**  I'm buying.  
**[1:00:30-1:00:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=1:00:30):**  I'm not necessarily in the only buy local camp.  
**[1:00:34-1:00:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=1:00:34):**  I do believe in international supply chains and stuff like that.  
**[1:00:39-1:00:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=1:00:39):**  In general, I live in Ballard in Seattle, which has one of the country's best farmers  
**[1:00:45-1:00:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=1:00:45):**  markets every Sunday.  
**[1:00:47-1:00:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=1:00:47):**  It's like three blocks from my apartment.  
**[1:00:49-1:00:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=1:00:49):**  I go there, I try to interact with them and buy the food.  
**[1:00:52-1:00:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=1:00:52):**  So I just pay attention more to the quality of what I'm eating.  
**[1:00:57-1:00:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=1:00:57):**  And that's fun.  
**[1:00:58-1:00:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=1:00:58):**  I like doing that.  
**[1:00:59-1:01:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=1:00:59):**  It feels good.  
**[1:01:00-1:01:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=1:01:00):**  I want to thank you so much for your time today, Paul.  
**[1:01:04-1:01:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=1:01:04):**  And I don't think it's the last time we're checking in.

**[1:01:17-1:01:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=1:01:17):**  Thank you so much for taking a deep dive into food, ag, offsets, removal and everything

**[1:02:26-1:02:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=1:02:26):**  After 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question how to put money  
**[1:02:31-1:02:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=1:02:31):**  to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011 and recording

**[1:03:37-1:03:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=1:03:37):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you and I'm very aware  
**[1:03:42-1:03:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=1:03:42):**  that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very different means.  
**[1:03:47-1:03:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=1:03:47):**  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to

**[1:03:57-1:04:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=1:03:57):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  
**[1:04:03-1:04:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=1:04:03):**  so you don't have to ride along.  
**[1:04:05-1:04:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=1:04:05):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[1:04:10-1:04:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=1:04:10):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[1:04:16-1:04:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=1:04:16):**  invest in and what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could  
**[1:04:20-1:04:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=1:04:20):**  find if you're a soil builder.  
**[1:04:22-1:04:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=1:04:22):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[1:04:27-1:04:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=1:04:27):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[1:04:31-1:04:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=1:04:31):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[1:04:36-1:04:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=1:04:36):**  So what is it not?  
**[1:04:37-1:04:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=1:04:37):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[1:04:39-1:04:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=1:04:39):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[1:04:41-1:04:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=1:04:41):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[1:04:45-1:04:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=1:04:45):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[1:04:47-1:04:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/04/15/paul-gambill/#t=1:04:47):**  Before making any investment please find professional investment advice.

**[0:00:12-0:00:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:00:12):**  Now on to the podcast.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:00:25):**  Welcome to Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food.  
**[0:00:28-0:00:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:00:28):**  This is a special dedicated series on transition finance.  
**[0:00:32-0:00:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:00:32):**  Why are we recording this series?  
**[0:00:34-0:00:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:00:34):**  Many farmers are ready to speed up their regenerative transition.  
**[0:00:37-0:00:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:00:37):**  They've looked for learning, done the courses, read the key books, hosted the gurus on their  
**[0:00:41-0:00:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:00:41):**  farms, explored farm-sized regenerative designs and most importantly started their pilots  
**[0:00:46-0:00:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:00:46):**  and feedback loops.  
**[0:00:48-0:00:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:00:48):**  This is where transition finance is key.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:00:50):**  A local bank loan often isn't feasible because of the short duration, lack of flexibility  
**[0:00:55-0:00:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:00:55):**  and the farmers lack of collateral.  
**[0:00:58-0:01:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:00:58):**  Furthermore, there is a limit of how much equity a farmer is able or willing to give  
**[0:01:02-0:01:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:01:02):**  away.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:01:03):**  That is why my co-host aspiring to be regenerative farmer Benedikt BÃ¶zel and I are embarking  
**[0:01:09-0:01:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:01:09):**  on a journey to find out what are the key principles of transition finance for regenerative  
**[0:01:15-0:01:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:01:15):**  farmers.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:01:16):**  We are interviewing leading practitioners in the regenerative agriculture and food finance  
**[0:01:20-0:01:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:01:20):**  space.  
**[0:01:21-0:01:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:01:21):**  They share their insights how they would finance the speed up of the regenerative transition  
**[0:01:26-0:01:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:01:26):**  on Benedikt's 1000 hectares, which is almost 2500 acres, farm in Germany close to Berlin.  
**[0:01:32-0:01:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:01:32):**  This is an open process.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:01:33):**  We are sharing our lessons through the podcast episodes as we go along.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:01:37):**  We don't have the answers yet, just a lot of questions.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:01:40):**  So please share with us any examples of transition finance you've seen, other inspiration, people  
**[0:01:45-0:01:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:01:45):**  to interview etc.

**[0:01:52-0:02:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:01:52):**  So welcome to the podcast show, Benedikt.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:00):**  I'm so excited to have you as my co-host on this journey.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:04):**  We're going to start with many interesting episodes and learn, I think, a lot on transition  
**[0:02:08-0:02:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:08):**  finance.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:09):**  So welcome.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:10):**  Yeah, thank you very much.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:11):**  I'm glad to be here.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:13):**  I think, you know, we have so many things to discuss and I'm really interested to see  
**[0:02:17-0:02:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:17):**  where the journey leads us.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:19):**  And can you start with giving a small introduction?  
**[0:02:22-0:02:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:22):**  I know you, I feel pretty well, but obviously the audience doesn't.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:26):**  Who you are and what made you take over a gigantic farm which we'll completely explore  
**[0:02:32-0:02:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:32):**  in the next episodes in Germany.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:34):**  Who's Benedikt Beusel?  
**[0:02:35-0:02:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:35):**  That's a good question.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:37):**  If I would always know that, you know, I think that would help me already quite a bit.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:43):**  So basically, I was born in Munich and lived there for the first couple of years of my  
**[0:02:47-0:02:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:47):**  life, but we always went to the countryside on the weekends and pretty much all I remember  
**[0:02:53-0:03:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:02:53):**  is actually playing on my own, you know, in the mud, in the forest, running around, being  
**[0:03:00-0:03:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:03:00):**  on my own, being free in the nature.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:03:04):**  Having two older sisters probably is part of that equation.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:03:06):**  You want to escape every now and then.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:03:09):**  Yeah, I think you kind of have to, especially in that age.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:03:12):**  And growing up, it was quite similar.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:03:14):**  We moved to the middle of Germany in the Rhineland where we also lived on the countryside.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:03:19):**  So for me, you know, especially in the first couple of years, it was always about being  
**[0:03:25-0:03:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:03:25):**  outside, hunting, fishing, you know, just being a boy in the open, so to say.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:03:32):**  So my connection to nature is really, yeah, from a very young age, I guess.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:03:37):**  And I was always fascinated by all different animals and species and, you know, all the  
**[0:03:42-0:03:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:03:42):**  complex systems and the real life you can experience when you're outside.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:03:49):**  But you didn't, I mean, you didn't turn into a farmer immediately.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:03:53):**  You didn't study biology or you went to farming school, but you turned into an investment  
**[0:03:59-0:04:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:03:59):**  banking career.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:04:00):**  That's quite a shift.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:04:01):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:04:02):**  I mean, it was actually quite the opposite.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:04:04):**  I mean, although having grown up like that and totally focused on nature, when I was  
**[0:04:10-0:04:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:04:10):**  in the age of, let's say, 18, 19, 20, the idea of being a farmer was not that compelling  
**[0:04:17-0:04:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:04:17):**  to me.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:04:18):**  Quite the opposite.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:04:19):**  You know, I was looking at the whole banking industry and investment banking.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:04:23):**  And I remember when we were like young kids starting to go out, you know, we were always  
**[0:04:28-0:04:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:04:28):**  telling the girls, yeah, we are an investment banker and we study on the LSE in London and  
**[0:04:32-0:04:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:04:32):**  so forth.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:04:33):**  And I think, you know, I kind of bought into that because obviously having that cool banking,  
**[0:04:41-0:04:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:04:41):**  a lot of money, idea and career, that was something I thought was, you know, interesting  
**[0:04:47-0:04:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:04:47):**  in a way and could be a career.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:04:49):**  So that's really how I got into that.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:04:51):**  And I think at that time I wasn't, let's say, I didn't reflect as much as you do when you  
**[0:04:58-0:04:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:04:58):**  get older naturally.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:04:59):**  So when I started in investment banking, we pretty much had the top phase 2006.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:05:06):**  Then we had the financial crisis 2007.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:05:08):**  And that's really, you know, when I started thinking about that whole process and idea  
**[0:05:13-0:05:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:05:13):**  and the kind of the value and the meaning that you can actually achieve in that industry.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:05:18):**  And I mean, seeing how this strong system of, I don't know, that strong financial system  
**[0:05:26-0:05:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:05:26):**  suddenly basically collapses into its collapses.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:05:31):**  And to see, basically, you started at the absolute height of the wave, basically.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:05:37):**  And then the absolute depth came like the strongest financial crisis since the Great  
**[0:05:41-0:05:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:05:41):**  Depression basically followed immediately after.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:05:43):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:05:44):**  And I mean, as a 22 year old, you know, you view and those kind of things are obviously  
**[0:05:49-0:05:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:05:49):**  quite different and seeing that immediate reaction and then seeing your cool managing  
**[0:05:56-0:06:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:05:56):**  directors sitting in their offices and crying and you knew, okay, they have like two, three  
**[0:06:01-0:06:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:06:01):**  different children.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:06:03):**  They have huge investment in you because they have to cover and suddenly they all don't  
**[0:06:08-0:06:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:06:08):**  have any jobs anymore.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:06:10):**  That really started a certain, at least emotional process with me.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:06:15):**  And I mean, I think that was really the time where I kind of, you know, after two, three  
**[0:06:20-0:06:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:06:20):**  years in investment banking, I started looking at, right, like, that's not your way.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:06:25):**  I mean, you know, I was like thinking about how can I really find, you know, what I'm  
**[0:06:30-0:06:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:06:30):**  supposed to do.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:06:31):**  And having grown up in nature, having had that strong connection all my life to, let's  
**[0:06:36-0:06:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:06:36):**  say, the natural world, I was thinking, okay, you know, this is like an area where we will  
**[0:06:41-0:06:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:06:41):**  have increasingly more problems and fundamental problems.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:06:46):**  Having seen how that crisis hit the industry and what huge effect that had on livelihoods  
**[0:06:51-0:06:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:06:51):**  from people all over the world, I thought, you know, as much as this is bad, you know,  
**[0:06:57-0:07:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:06:57):**  you have to turn your talents and your focus onto something that is actually good.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:02):**  So that brought me back to, you know, the question of, you know, how can you contribute?  
**[0:07:08-0:07:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:08):**  How can you bring your talent to an area where it really matters?  
**[0:07:12-0:07:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:12):**  And naturally, let's say, nature and resources and those processes were my strongest focus,  
**[0:07:19-0:07:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:19):**  I guess.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:21):**  And that led you to start focusing more on environmental technologies and agtech.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:27):**  How did that happen?  
**[0:07:28-0:07:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:28):**  How did you roll into that?  
**[0:07:29-0:07:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:29):**  What were exciting moments you remember?  
**[0:07:31-0:07:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:31):**  I mean, still you're involved in agtech, but very soil focused.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:34):**  But let's say before you took over the farm, what was your focus?  
**[0:07:37-0:07:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:37):**  Well, I mean, basically, partly through my history, right?  
**[0:07:41-0:07:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:41):**  So I had all that, let's say, financial knowledge and experience from the university, then working  
**[0:07:48-0:07:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:48):**  in mergers and acquisitions with a bank.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:51):**  After that, having done some restructuring, I knew that, you know, that is a kind of skill  
**[0:07:55-0:07:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:55):**  set and an instrument that could be quite beneficial.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:07:58):**  And I didn't want to move, you know, too far away from that.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:08:02):**  So I was looking for some situation where I can bring that in, but also, you know, move  
**[0:08:07-0:08:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:08:07):**  towards things where my passion lies.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:08:10):**  So that being, let's say, resources and land use.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:08:13):**  And so I was between those two, having the financial side on one hand, and, you know,  
**[0:08:18-0:08:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:08:18):**  that new kind of way and vision of getting active in the natural world, so to say.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:08:24):**  And then I was, you know, screening basically on a worldwide scale, you know, how can you  
**[0:08:29-0:08:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:08:29):**  combine the two?  
**[0:08:30-0:08:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:08:30):**  What can you derive from that?  
**[0:08:32-0:08:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:08:32):**  How can you develop that somehow?  
**[0:08:34-0:08:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:08:34):**  And obviously, I looked towards the US, and that was a time where you had like the first  
**[0:08:41-0:08:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:08:41):**  couple of startups in the ag space, and you had VCs like Kultivia and Antera was already  
**[0:08:50-0:08:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:08:50):**  doing their first fund.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:08:52):**  Avrio was there also.  
**[0:08:54-0:08:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:08:54):**  But there was no ag fund.  
**[0:08:55-0:09:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:08:55):**  There was like the structure, the ag tech structure, as we know today, wasn't yet at  
**[0:09:00-0:09:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:09:00):**  all actually developed.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:09:01):**  But seeing that idea of innovation, technological, digital innovation in the agriculture space,  
**[0:09:08-0:09:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:09:08):**  I immediately thought, okay, wow, I mean, this is it.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:09:11):**  This is exactly what we need.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:09:13):**  We can only solve those huge problems through innovation and obviously technology and digitalization,  
**[0:09:19-0:09:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:09:19):**  obviously, bring a huge potential to that.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:09:23):**  So after I kind of, I guess, I mean, found that or understood that, well, like, understood  
**[0:09:31-0:09:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:09:31):**  that incredible potential, I wrote, let's say, a pitch, so to say, and started connecting  
**[0:09:35-0:09:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:09:35):**  and contacting and meeting all the large German agriculture companies, potential investors.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:09:43):**  I looked for startups in the space.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:09:44):**  I reached out to universities.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:09:46):**  I started talking to different politicians and basically went around saying, guys, look,  
**[0:09:52-0:09:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:09:52):**  there is something happening here.  
**[0:09:54-0:09:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:09:54):**  There's innovation being developed.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:09:57):**  There's incredible potential and we need to be part of that.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:10:02):**  And I mean, going to a very traditional, often also family run company focused on agriculture  
**[0:10:13-0:10:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:10:13):**  equipment and telling them about venture capital and investing into ag tech innovation.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:10:21):**  I mean, you know, I think those guys, they were always checking underneath the table  
**[0:10:26-0:10:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:10:26):**  if I'm wearing shoes from made of wood or something because that was just not on the  
**[0:10:31-0:10:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:10:31):**  cards.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:10:32):**  They never heard of it.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:10:34):**  They never thought about that.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:10:35):**  Like, even the pronunciation of startup is something that they took like three appointments  
**[0:10:41-0:10:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:10:41):**  to get going.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:10:45):**  So basically, I think that was like the first time that we tried to develop those kinds  
**[0:10:51-0:10:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:10:51):**  of ideas.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:10:52):**  But you could immediately see that if you come as a 25, 26 year old, you want to raise  
**[0:10:57-0:11:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:10:57):**  a fund, invest in ag tech startups after the biotech bubble, having no track record.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:11:03):**  I mean, that's just not a very good selling point, right?  
**[0:11:05-0:11:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:11:05):**  I mean, I wouldn't give anyone money who would be in that position.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:11:09):**  So during that phase, I met someone who just raised or started a venture capital, corporate  
**[0:11:15-0:11:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:11:15):**  venture capital fund with Billfinger.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:11:17):**  And Billfinger is also quite a traditional company in different manufacturing and engineering  
**[0:11:23-0:11:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:11:23):**  processes.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:11:24):**  And because of their capability in water and garbage and renewable energy technologies,  
**[0:11:33-0:11:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:11:33):**  they were already quite close to ag tech, let's say.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:11:36):**  So I started working with them looking at the market in a, I guess, in a similar way.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:11:41):**  But then they had some serious problems with regards to revenue forecasts.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:11:46):**  And the share price fell from 84 to 40 something, which I think was the first in German history  
**[0:11:52-0:11:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:11:52):**  to go down that badly.  
**[0:11:54-0:11:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:11:54):**  So obviously, in those kind of situations, venture capital is one of the things that  
**[0:11:58-0:11:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:11:58):**  I think.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:11:59):**  The last thing.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:12:00):**  Exactly.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:12:01):**  I mean, having to lay off 4,000 people and then telling someone that you'll invest into  
**[0:12:05-0:12:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:12:05):**  a startup, I think it's also a difficult one.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:12:09):**  But that was a time for me that obviously, I was very involved in the whole market of  
**[0:12:16-0:12:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:12:16):**  agriculture startups in Germany.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:12:18):**  I spoke to many of the associations that have some connection to farming.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:12:24):**  I did various talks and speeches at political institutes and political, like for the government.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:12:32):**  And what I realized that all of those technologies, all of the problems, all of the, let's say,  
**[0:12:39-0:12:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:12:39):**  underlying fundamentals, all of that, let's say, complexity was just overwhelming.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:12:46):**  So I really had that strong feeling that in order to develop the market, to develop that  
**[0:12:54-0:13:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:12:54):**  idea, to produce technologies, to help startups also find solutions, you need people who are  
**[0:13:01-0:13:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:13:01):**  on the ground.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:13:02):**  And you need people who are on the ground and at the same time, open and willing and  
**[0:13:07-0:13:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:13:07):**  able to speak to all different interest groups.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:13:11):**  I mean, you've got to be able to talk to an ecological farmer and a conventional farmer.  
**[0:13:16-0:13:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:13:16):**  You've got to be able to talk to people who are from the conservation side.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:13:19):**  You've got to talk to large corporates, like Bayer, for example.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:13:23):**  You've got to be able to talk to, or not only able, but willing to politicians because we  
**[0:13:28-0:13:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:13:28):**  can't solve those kind of problems on our own.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:13:31):**  No one can.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:13:32):**  It always has to be a sort of interdisciplinary, multifunctional group of actors and different  
**[0:13:38-0:13:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:13:38):**  actors coming together and saying, okay, let's do this.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:13:41):**  Let's solve this thing.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:13:42):**  And this thing for you, also, if I understand and remember correctly, slowly more and more  
**[0:13:47-0:13:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:13:47):**  and more, it started to click, like this thing starts with soil, like it starts and ends  
**[0:13:52-0:13:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:13:52):**  probably with soil.  
**[0:13:54-0:13:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:13:54):**  And was it a realization that you always had?  
**[0:13:57-0:14:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:13:57):**  Or was it something that over these many talks you did, many conversations you had, many  
**[0:14:01-0:14:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:14:01):**  companies and startups you looked at, and obviously many farms you visited, and you  
**[0:14:06-0:14:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:14:06):**  spend, I'm imagining also time on the farm of your parents, that soil moment, was there  
**[0:14:12-0:14:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:14:12):**  a soil moment?  
**[0:14:13-0:14:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:14:13):**  Was it a soil process?  
**[0:14:14-0:14:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:14:14):**  How did that grow?  
**[0:14:15-0:14:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:14:15):**  Yeah, I mean, definitely.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:14:16):**  I mean, that's a really good question.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:14:19):**  I guess there was two moments that kind of came together.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:14:23):**  There was a soil moment and there was a me, myself and I moment, I guess.  
**[0:14:27-0:14:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:14:27):**  So after deciding- It's our soil moment.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:14:32):**  I think they're pretty much the same.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:14:34):**  But after starting, I took over the family farm in December 2016.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:14:40):**  And obviously coming from, let's say the technology side, I was deeply interested and fascinated  
**[0:14:45-0:14:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:14:45):**  by the whole potential of, let's say, technology and digitalization.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:14:49):**  And I thought, innovation is key.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:14:52):**  So basically we're situated one hour east of Berlin.  
**[0:14:55-0:15:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:14:55):**  And what is very special about the place is the combination of incredibly low precipitation  
**[0:15:00-0:15:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:15:00):**  and sandy soil.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:15:02):**  So as far as the precipitation is concerned, we have an 10-year average of around 450 millimeters,  
**[0:15:10-0:15:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:15:10):**  whereas the last two years are around 200 to 300 millimeters per year.  
**[0:15:14-0:15:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:15:14):**  And then the soil at the same time is very sandy.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:15:17):**  So we have about between 1.1 and 1.5% organic matter, and that combination obviously is  
**[0:15:26-0:15:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:15:26):**  incredibly challenging for growing anything really.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:15:32):**  So I was thinking of specifying it, but it comes down to it that even a cactus needs  
**[0:15:41-0:15:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:15:41):**  some water.  
**[0:15:44-0:15:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:15:44):**  So basically I came from the technology side and thought, you know, innovation is key,  
**[0:15:49-0:15:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:15:49):**  technological innovation is key.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:15:51):**  And I was in contact with a couple of large agriculture equipment manufacturers saying,  
**[0:15:57-0:16:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:15:57):**  let's have an example of a farm, an ecological farm, 1,000 hectares, where we completely  
**[0:16:04-0:16:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:16:04):**  bring in all the technology that we have, all the digital processes.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:16:08):**  And it's one hour east of Berlin.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:16:11):**  We can have this place where people come together, potential buyers, customers will do events  
**[0:16:17-0:16:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:16:17):**  and just show what we actually can do already through technology.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:16:20):**  And through that process, I was sitting in my office looking outside and thinking, wow,  
**[0:16:29-0:16:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:16:29):**  it's not raining.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:16:30):**  And it continues to not rain.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:16:32):**  And I'm thinking, I'm reading about satellite and drones and this and here and forth.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:16:38):**  And I was like, wow, it's, I mean, like the reality of what I'll see when I look out of  
**[0:16:43-0:16:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:16:43):**  the window versus the theory of technology and instruments that I have on this contract  
**[0:16:50-0:16:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:16:50):**  lying before me, it just has nothing to do with each other.  
**[0:16:55-0:16:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:16:55):**  The one thing outside, you know, the thing that I'm considering in the office, there  
**[0:16:59-0:17:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:16:59):**  is a huge discrepancy between the two when it comes to actual, let's say, applicability.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:17:05):**  practicality, yeah, I mean, exactly.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:17:09):**  So I stopped all of that and said, okay, this can't be the solution.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:17:13):**  And I thought, okay, so what is the by far most important asset?  
**[0:17:18-0:17:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:17:18):**  And what is like the thing I have to put all my focus on?  
**[0:17:22-0:17:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:17:22):**  And then that's exactly where the soil moment really started.  
**[0:17:27-0:17:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:17:27):**  Because I was like, okay, I mean, this is the key.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:17:30):**  I mean, soil for us, build soil organic matter, grow healthy soil, build soil fertility.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:17:36):**  And that being said, I mean, it's the soil biology, physics, chemistry, I mean, so many  
**[0:17:41-0:17:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:17:41):**  things coming together.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:17:43):**  If I managed to build that, then that is the key for for any challenge that that there  
**[0:17:48-0:17:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:17:48):**  might come.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:17:49):**  And I mean, there's gonna come very many, right.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:17:52):**  And then all kinds of technologies and all kinds of ag tech, etc. will be extremely useful  
**[0:17:59-0:18:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:17:59):**  if focused on building soil.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:18:00):**  Exactly.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:18:01):**  I mean, your soil moment.  
**[0:18:03-0:18:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:18:03):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:18:04):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:18:05):**  I mean, I think, you know, I don't want to sound like I don't think technology or digitalization  
**[0:18:09-0:18:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:18:09):**  is is not going to help us.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:18:12):**  I think the potential is incredible.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:18:14):**  But it has to start from the soil.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:18:16):**  And what I see today in many, many, many cases, especially in agriculture is that all the  
**[0:18:22-0:18:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:18:22):**  technology, all the digital products that we have, they always try to fight a certain  
**[0:18:29-0:18:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:18:29):**  problem, you know.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:18:31):**  But I think what we do in order to restore soil in order to, you know, find agricultural  
**[0:18:37-0:18:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:18:37):**  land use models that actually grow the soil and enhance biodiversity is not fight the  
**[0:18:43-0:18:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:18:43):**  outcomes or fight the problems, but maybe take a step back and think about the root  
**[0:18:49-0:18:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:18:49):**  causes of the problems and how we can actually change the root causes of the problems using  
**[0:18:55-0:18:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:18:55):**  nature like in line with nature.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:18:58):**  And I think that was then, so to say, my moment, first realizing that, you know, the focus  
**[0:19:06-0:19:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:19:06):**  has to be soil and then realizing that, you know, there's very different methods of doing  
**[0:19:12-0:19:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:19:12):**  agriculture of thinking agriculture of understanding agriculture and that, you know, being inspired  
**[0:19:18-0:19:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:19:18):**  by, you know, all the legends, obviously, that we all know and the books that we all  
**[0:19:23-0:19:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:19:23):**  read, you know, starting from Elin Savery, Gabe Brown, Joe Zalatin, Ernst Goetsch from  
**[0:19:28-0:19:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:19:28):**  Brazil, Elaine Ingham, understanding what these guys, you know, have been doing for  
**[0:19:34-0:19:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:19:34):**  20, 30 years, which amazing ways of working with nature can help us in such a, yeah, I  
**[0:19:42-0:19:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:19:42):**  mean, practical way, yeah, practical, amazing way.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:19:47):**  And not taking away from, I think, the potential of technology and the potential of machinery  
**[0:19:52-0:19:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:19:52):**  and the potential of software and etc.  
**[0:19:55-0:20:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:19:55):**  But the goals of the system have to be right in this case, does it help farmers build soil  
**[0:20:01-0:20:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:20:01):**  at scale?  
**[0:20:02-0:20:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:20:02):**  Or does it enable farmers to do it faster?  
**[0:20:04-0:20:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:20:04):**  Or does it enable someone like you to actually make other choices and other choices that  
**[0:20:09-0:20:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:20:09):**  you otherwise wouldn't have made?  
**[0:20:11-0:20:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:20:11):**  Is technology actually enabling you to do more?  
**[0:20:13-0:20:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:20:13):**  Exactly.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:20:14):**  And I think today, as of now, we all like, there's on the one side, you know, there's  
**[0:20:20-0:20:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:20:20):**  people who are pushing, obviously, the developments of technology and let's say, in a way that,  
**[0:20:27-0:20:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:20:27):**  you know, we see agriculture being done on a huge scale at the moment.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:20:33):**  And then on the other side, if there is sites, but then there's this area, this other group  
**[0:20:39-0:20:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:20:39):**  that is, you know, focused on, let's say, nature based solutions, multifunctional land  
**[0:20:43-0:20:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:20:43):**  use models, regenerative farming methods.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:20:46):**  And I think the combination of the two, which is already here and there on a small level,  
**[0:20:53-0:20:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:20:53):**  it may be already happening.  
**[0:20:54-0:21:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:20:54):**  But I think once we bring those two groups together, or those two lines of thought, I  
**[0:21:01-0:21:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:21:01):**  think this is when agriculture will be just fascinating and like incredibly, let's say,  
**[0:21:10-0:21:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:21:10):**  helping that.  
**[0:21:11-0:21:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:21:11):**  Rewarding.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:21:12):**  Rewarding not only for the farmer, but also on a, let's say, on a wider scale.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:21:17):**  Because if you ask me, you know, farming, in my belief, is by far the biggest instrument  
**[0:21:22-0:21:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:21:22):**  that we have for many of the big problems that we see today.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:21:26):**  And I mean, we are talking about obviously CO2 sequestration, but we're also talking  
**[0:21:30-0:21:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:21:30):**  about health.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:21:31):**  I mean, that is one of the main parts.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:21:34):**  Food is medicine.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:21:35):**  We're talking about inequality.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:21:37):**  We're talking about rural development.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:21:39):**  We're talking about education.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:21:40):**  I mean, and this is, I think, all in like, not, how do you say it, like, this is all  
**[0:21:47-0:21:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:21:47):**  so strongly connected to the question of how we treat nature, how we use nature in a way  
**[0:21:54-0:21:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:21:54):**  that we can actually enhance it and make it better.  
**[0:21:57-0:22:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:21:57):**  And having that regenerative idea of land use, I think, yeah, it's something that we've  
**[0:22:03-0:22:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:22:03):**  already seen picking up so much in just the last couple of years.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:22:06):**  But I think it's going to be the main thing that we'll be talking about, and not only  
**[0:22:11-0:22:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:22:11):**  in the agriculture space, but I think it will actually leapfrog into other industries, which  
**[0:22:16-0:22:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:22:16):**  we can already see.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:22:17):**  And I think that is incredible because, you know, that kind of concept coming out of agriculture  
**[0:22:22-0:22:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:22:22):**  into other industries is, yeah, it's the way it should be, I guess.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:22:26):**  Yeah, and I think it will be fascinating in this series because this is not the last time  
**[0:22:32-0:22:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:22:32):**  we'll be discussing.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:22:33):**  We're definitely going to focus on transition finance and obviously on the farm you took  
**[0:22:38-0:22:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:22:38):**  over and we're going to discuss that a bit later.  
**[0:22:40-0:22:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:22:40):**  But it touches upon so many other things.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:22:43):**  It touches on ecosystem services, on land ownership, on health care, on CO2, on water.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:22:48):**  I mean, they're, and we're not going to shy away from that.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:22:51):**  So I'm very excited to really dive deep into this case and to really see where we can get  
**[0:22:58-0:22:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:22:58):**  with these models.

**[0:23:37-0:23:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:23:37):**  Dear friends of the podcast, I'm super excited to share with you the online video course  
**[0:23:42-0:23:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:23:42):**  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[0:23:46-0:23:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:23:46):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:23:50):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[0:23:52-0:23:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:23:52):**  After a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of audio asking the question  
**[0:23:56-0:24:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:23:56):**  how to put money to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011  
**[0:24:01-0:24:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:24:01):**  and recording these podcasts since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:24:06):**  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  
**[0:24:08-0:24:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:24:08):**  How have we built our decision-making framework?

**[0:24:43-0:24:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:24:43):**  People that are building soil at scale.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:24:46):**  And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office  
**[0:24:49-0:24:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:24:49):**  or as private individuals or people who are putting other people's money to work through  
**[0:24:53-0:24:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:24:53):**  foundations, institutional capital, banks, insurance companies, etc.  
**[0:24:58-0:24:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:24:58):**  Is this course free?  
**[0:24:59-0:25:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:24:59):**  No.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:25:00):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:25:03):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you and I'm very aware  
**[0:25:08-0:25:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:25:08):**  that among the listeners of this podcast we have people with very different means.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:25:12):**  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[0:25:17-0:25:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:25:17):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:25:20):**  Thank you.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:25:21):**  So what is this course?  
**[0:25:22-0:25:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:25:22):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  
**[0:25:29-0:25:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:25:29):**  so you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:25:31):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:25:36-0:25:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:25:36):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:25:41-0:25:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:25:41):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[0:25:46-0:25:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:25:46):**  if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:25:47):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:25:52-0:25:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:25:52):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:25:56-0:26:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:25:56):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:26:01):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:26:02-0:26:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:26:02):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:26:04-0:26:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:26:04):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:26:06-0:26:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:26:06):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:26:10):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:26:12):**  Before making any investment please find professional investment advice.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/#t=0:26:17):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking, click on

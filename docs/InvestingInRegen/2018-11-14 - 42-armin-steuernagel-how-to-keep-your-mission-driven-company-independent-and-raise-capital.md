**[0:00:12-0:00:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:16-0:00:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:00:16):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture, investing as if  
**[0:00:20-0:00:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:00:20):**  the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:00:21):**  A podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:26-0:00:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:00:26):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:00:31-0:00:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:00:31):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:00:36):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:38-0:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:00:38):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:00:42-0:00:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:00:42):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:00:45):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:00:50-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:00:50):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:00:54):**  You will listen to an interview about something many never consider, but we have discussed  
**[0:00:58-0:01:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:00:58):**  before when it comes to land with Thomas and Ian, ownership structures.  
**[0:01:01-0:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:01:01):**  In this case, it's not necessarily about land, but about companies and especially mission  
**[0:01:06-0:01:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:01:06):**  driven companies.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:01:07):**  Do we dare to ask the power question, who controls the steering wheel of a company?  
**[0:01:11-0:01:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:01:11):**  And is that steering wheel for sale?  
**[0:01:13-0:01:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:01:13):**  Is it inherited or is it steward owned?  
**[0:01:16-0:01:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:01:16):**  And how do we make sure that companies, especially impactful companies, won't turn into a commodity?  
**[0:01:21-0:01:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:01:21):**  Because what use is it if we all spend a lot of our time, sweat, energy and money to build  
**[0:01:26-0:01:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:01:26):**  amazing regenerative food and agriculture companies that get sold when they become profitable,  
**[0:01:31-0:01:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:01:31):**  while they still could have and could have made an enormous impact for the decades to  
**[0:01:35-0:01:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:01:35):**  come.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:01:36):**  And now without further ado, the interview.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:01:40):**  Enjoy.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:01:41):**  Welcome to the podcast.  
**[0:01:42-0:01:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:01:42):**  I'm Koen van Zeyen, your host.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:01:44):**  Today I'm joined by Armin, entrepreneur in food, co-founder of the Purpose Network and  
**[0:01:47-0:01:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:01:47):**  Impact Investor.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:01:49):**  Purpose Network helps companies to stay independent and mission driven for the long term.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:01:53):**  They believe that by innovating the way companies are owned, financed and governed, companies  
**[0:01:57-0:02:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:01:57):**  become more successful in the long run and can benefit all of society.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:02:01):**  Steward owned companies make a legally binding commitment to their employees and customers,  
**[0:02:06-0:02:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:02:06):**  that the company is not a speculative good or commodity, but a group of people working  
**[0:02:10-0:02:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:02:10):**  for a purpose.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:02:11):**  This all sounds extremely interesting and very relevant for the regenerative food and  
**[0:02:15-0:02:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:02:15):**  agriculture sector.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:02:16):**  So let's find out more.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:02:17):**  Welcome Armin.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:02:18):**  Hi, good morning.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:02:20):**  So to start with a personal question, how do you end up working on ownership structures  
**[0:02:25-0:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:02:25):**  of mission driven companies?  
**[0:02:26-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:02:26):**  Yeah, I started several companies myself.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:02:30):**  And so I was more or less forced to think about ownership structures already very early  
**[0:02:35-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:02:35):**  on.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:02:37):**  And but there was one particular moment or one particular event that somehow pushed me  
**[0:02:44-0:02:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:02:44):**  to think even more about it.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:02:46):**  That was actually an employee of mine.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:02:47):**  So I founded also one company in the organic food sector and organic food for children.  
**[0:02:54-0:03:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:02:54):**  And my co-founder and I, we always told everybody, ourselves, our families, but also our employees,  
**[0:03:01-0:03:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:03:01):**  well, we're all getting up every morning to get children excited for good and healthy  
**[0:03:05-0:03:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:03:05):**  food.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:03:06):**  That's the reason.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:03:07):**  You know, that's why we're working here.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:03:09):**  And one day, one of the employees of us came to us and said, wait a minute, is that actually  
**[0:03:16-0:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:03:16):**  true?  
**[0:03:17-0:03:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:03:17):**  Are we actually working for that purpose?  
**[0:03:20-0:03:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:03:20):**  Or aren't we actually working for you both?  
**[0:03:23-0:03:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:03:23):**  Because you can monetize it.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:03:25):**  You can sell it.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:03:26):**  You can pass it on to your children.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:03:27):**  They can monetize it, etc.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:03:29):**  And we actually working for your wealth.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:03:35):**  And that was kind of a provocative question.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:03:38):**  But we realized legally, she was right.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:03:45):**  And I realized, you know, without intending it, without wanting it, I had set up a legal  
**[0:03:53-0:03:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:03:53):**  entity that would somehow serve my wealth.  
**[0:03:56-0:04:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:03:56):**  And that was against my feelings, against my intentions, because we had this understanding  
**[0:04:04-0:04:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:04:04):**  of, you know, we're working together.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:04:05):**  It's a project.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:04:06):**  We want to serve a certain purpose.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:04:08):**  We want to create something great, etc.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:04:12):**  And that's what so many of the impact entrepreneurs somehow feel.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:04:16):**  They really want to change something.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:04:18):**  You know, that's the attitude.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:04:19):**  And then you look for a legal form.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:04:22):**  You need to incorporate because you need a bank account.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:04:26):**  Very simple.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:04:27):**  And that's only possible with a legal form.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:04:29):**  So you look around and you probably choose a limited company in whatever form in whatever  
**[0:04:33-0:04:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:04:33):**  country.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:04:34):**  But in the moment of incorporation, something strange happens.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:04:38):**  Suddenly you're not anymore like the steward of this idea, the custodian, the servant who  
**[0:04:45-0:04:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:04:45):**  really helps this idea to life.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:04:47):**  But suddenly the relationship changes.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:04:51):**  The idea, the purpose suddenly serves you because you have you are owning wealth.  
**[0:04:56-0:04:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:04:56):**  You can sell your idea.  
**[0:04:57-0:04:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:04:57):**  You can destroy it.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:04:59):**  You have all the rights that you have if you own, for example, this laptop you are sitting  
**[0:05:05-0:05:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:05:05):**  in front of now.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:05:06):**  So that somehow felt strange when I realized, oh, there's something wrong.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:05:10):**  I have to look for different ownership structures to somehow make sure that we can all work  
**[0:05:17-0:05:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:05:17):**  really for a purpose here and that I can remain a steward and don't become just a normal,  
**[0:05:26-0:05:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:05:26):**  you know, shareholder and in the future an absentee owner who just collects profits.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:05:31):**  So that was somehow the problem.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:05:33):**  And that led me to thinking about these questions and then also finding solutions and starting  
**[0:05:39-0:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:05:39):**  purpose.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:05:40):**  And can you, I mean, it sounds extremely relevant and interesting.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:05:44):**  Can you make it concrete with some examples?  
**[0:05:46-0:05:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:05:46):**  I know you've been working in the startup space and you've been working in the slightly  
**[0:05:50-0:05:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:05:50):**  later stage, more much more mature companies.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:05:53):**  Can you do an example in both of how that how do you keep this practical?  
**[0:05:59-0:06:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:05:59):**  How do you keep this workable?  
**[0:06:00-0:06:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:06:00):**  How does it work?  
**[0:06:01-0:06:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:06:01):**  And some examples to make it concrete.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:06:04):**  Yeah.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:06:05):**  So maybe before I give an example of a startup, I can give the example of my own company.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:06:11):**  So now with that problem in mind, how can we have a different ownership structures?  
**[0:06:16-0:06:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:06:16):**  I went around and looked for companies who did it differently.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:06:20):**  And I found actually there are companies who have been doing it differently for four decades,  
**[0:06:27-0:06:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:06:27):**  even more than 100 years.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:06:30):**  And I collected a lot of them and some of the brands are known, like John Lewis company,  
**[0:06:36-0:06:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:06:36):**  some are less known, like ZEISS or Dr. Hauschka.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:06:43):**  And I realized they all have found very interesting ownership structures, sometimes with a foundation  
**[0:06:48-0:06:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:06:48):**  involved in there, sometimes with a trust that all ensure basically two things, two  
**[0:06:54-0:07:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:06:54):**  main principles that I became to believe that they are actually the core of really making  
**[0:07:01-0:07:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:07:01):**  sure that the company is steward owned, as I call it, or you could also say self-owned.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:07:09):**  And so one thing that all of them make sure is self-governance.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:07:14):**  So they all somehow make sure the majority of the voting rights, the majority of the  
**[0:07:20-0:07:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:07:20):**  steering wheel basically of the company isn't a tradable commodity anymore.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:07:25):**  So the steering wheel cannot be sold, it cannot be passed on to children.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:07:28):**  It's always held in trust basically in hands of people who are stewards, who are really  
**[0:07:33-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:07:33):**  connected to the company, who are often actively engaged working in the company.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:07:40):**  And this can be made sure, as I said, by a foundation, by a trust, by many other different  
**[0:07:44-0:07:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:07:44):**  solutions we can come to that later.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:07:46):**  And the second principle, besides the self-governance principle, is the principle of purpose that  
**[0:07:50-0:07:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:07:50):**  all of these companies, even big companies like Bosch, really adhere to.  
**[0:07:55-0:08:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:07:55):**  And that's, yeah, principle of purpose that basically says our entire endeavor, our company  
**[0:08:02-0:08:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:08:02):**  is there for a purpose.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:08:04):**  And yes, we need to make profits, but profits are seen as a means to an end and not an end  
**[0:08:10-0:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:08:10):**  in itself.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:08:11):**  And what does it mean concretely?  
**[0:08:12-0:08:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:08:12):**  It means you are, if you make profits, of course, you pay back investors or you're paying  
**[0:08:17-0:08:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:08:17):**  even a good return to investors.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:08:19):**  But then the rest, you are reinvesting, you're donating, and you are capping the upside for  
**[0:08:25-0:08:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:08:25):**  all stakeholders to make sure that there's enough money being reinvested and used for  
**[0:08:30-0:08:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:08:30):**  the purpose.  
**[0:08:31-0:08:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:08:31):**  Now, these are two principles that somehow all of these companies that I and then later  
**[0:08:37-0:08:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:08:37):**  also a lot of other friends and colleagues looked into, somehow implement.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:08:45):**  And yeah, that's what we came to call Steward Ownership.  
**[0:08:50-0:08:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:08:50):**  And now, how is that doable concretely in a certain situation?  
**[0:08:56-0:08:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:08:56):**  Let's say a startup.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:08:58):**  Let me give you an example of maybe, you know, Ecosia?  
**[0:09:03-0:09:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:09:03):**  Yeah, sure.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:09:05):**  The search engine.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:09:06):**  Ecosia is a great search engine that everybody should use because it's planting trees with  
**[0:09:13-0:09:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:09:13):**  your searches and it's not tracking you, so it's better than Google.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:09:19):**  Has planted over 40 million trees in the meantime.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:09:21):**  And the founder could be a quite filthy rich man if he sold the company because he has  
**[0:09:29-0:09:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:09:29):**  more than 8 million users.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:09:30):**  And you know, you can calculate yourself how many millions he would get if he sold it to,  
**[0:09:37-0:09:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:09:37):**  let's say, Dr. Go or Yahoo or whoever.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:09:40):**  He decided not to do that.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:09:42):**  He decided, I want to promise to the entire world, to all stakeholders, to my employees,  
**[0:09:48-0:09:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:09:48):**  that this is a company that's self-owned, that's Steward-owned.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:09:52):**  That means I and also some others are stewards for a certain time.  
**[0:09:56-0:09:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:09:56):**  We cannot take out any profits for ourselves.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:09:59):**  We just have the voting rights.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:10:00):**  We just have, so say, the steering wheel in trust.  
**[0:10:03-0:10:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:10:03):**  Then we need to give it back to the company once we leave the company and there are certain  
**[0:10:09-0:10:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:10:09):**  succession mechanisms in place.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:10:11):**  So he promised that and we designed his entire charter in that way that, you know, now he  
**[0:10:18-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:10:18):**  holds only shares that have voting rights.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:10:22):**  But then there is a very important problem because a charter can always be changed.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:10:28):**  You could promise this and then, you know, the next day, once a big hedge fund comes  
**[0:10:34-0:10:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:10:34):**  along and says, well, we want to buy you for a crazy amount of money, you could say, well,  
**[0:10:40-0:10:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:10:40):**  wait a minute, I just changed the charter again.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:10:42):**  So we needed a security there and we needed somehow a mission lock.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:10:47):**  And that mission lock we found in a golden share or impact share or veto share as we  
**[0:10:53-0:10:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:10:53):**  sometimes call it.  
**[0:10:55-0:11:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:10:55):**  And so basically Ecosia now implemented exactly that structure.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:11:00):**  They said, okay, we have two share classes.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:11:02):**  One is for stewards.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:11:04):**  They hold the control.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:11:06):**  And they can do everything, but they cannot change their promise.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:11:09):**  They cannot fall behind their promise.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:11:11):**  If they want to change that, they need 100 percent majority and one percent of the shares  
**[0:11:16-0:11:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:11:16):**  lies in a foundation.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:11:17):**  In that case, it's the purpose foundation, but it can be also any other foundation that  
**[0:11:21-0:11:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:11:21):**  has the right and the obligation to veto any attempt of falling back behind their promise.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:11:28):**  And this foundation itself has in its charter this kind of rule to veto these attempts.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:11:36):**  And in the case of the purpose foundation, it holds these kinds of veto shares now in  
**[0:11:40-0:11:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:11:40):**  more than a dozen cases.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:11:42):**  So this is one way, but there are, of course, many other ways to implement steward ownership.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:11:50):**  And you cannot believe what kind of effect this very hard legal commitment that you cannot  
**[0:11:58-0:12:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:11:58):**  roll back, that's the important thing, had when Christian, the founder of Ecosia, told  
**[0:12:05-0:12:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:12:05):**  this to his employees.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:12:06):**  You know, that was such a magical moment because people really understood, okay, he's serious.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:12:13):**  We're not talking just about it.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:12:14):**  So that it has an enormous motivational effect.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:12:17):**  It somehow enables people to and it fosters intrinsic motivation.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:12:24):**  That's maybe the best expression.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:12:25):**  It allows people to really be intrinsic.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:12:28):**  So this is a startup example.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:12:30):**  Is that what you know, what helps you to understand or do you want to hear something more from  
**[0:12:35-0:12:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:12:35):**  the investment world?  
**[0:12:37-0:12:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:12:37):**  Definitely.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:12:38):**  It helps to, I think, paint a picture that in the impact sector and maybe in food in  
**[0:12:43-0:12:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:12:43):**  the impact sector and agriculture as well, we often talk about impact, but maybe leave  
**[0:12:49-0:12:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:12:49):**  it at that.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:12:50):**  And things change, companies change, interests change, personal situations change.  
**[0:12:55-0:12:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:12:55):**  And maybe at some point we find ourselves in a position where there's an offer or a  
**[0:12:59-0:13:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:12:59):**  lot of money on the table, like in many cases, or like the organic food movement now is being  
**[0:13:04-0:13:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:13:04):**  threatened by that.  
**[0:13:05-0:13:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:13:05):**  And it's very difficult to say no to that when there's a huge, huge offer on the table.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:13:09):**  But when there's a, we maybe forgot to make the logical next step to actually make it  
**[0:13:15-0:13:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:13:15):**  a legal legally binding agreement to not change the mission.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:13:20):**  And unless you have that, there are only very few people that say no to, I don't know how  
**[0:13:24-0:13:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:13:24):**  many pensions and their children's pensions.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:13:27):**  And who's to blame if somebody offers 200 million or 50 million or whatever the number  
**[0:13:31-0:13:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:13:31):**  is for your company that you and all your colleagues worked for so long.  
**[0:13:35-0:13:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:13:35):**  The problem is it goes to one family.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:13:37):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:13:38):**  No, it's, I would say our human psych is not built to resist to that kind of 100, 200 million  
**[0:13:48-0:13:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:13:48):**  offers.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:13:49):**  And it, well, I, we work together with entrepreneurs who actually have gone through that kind of  
**[0:13:57-0:13:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:13:57):**  internal processes.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:13:59):**  And that's super interesting.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:14:00):**  You know what, how hard it is even for impact entrepreneurs.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:14:04):**  I can give you one example of a company that I shouldn't mention, like, but, but I can  
**[0:14:12-0:14:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:14:12):**  tell you they, they, it's a company in a tech space and they got an offer by LinkedIn, you  
**[0:14:18-0:14:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:14:18):**  know, one of the big companies.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:14:20):**  And LinkedIn started and they were like 20 million and they said, no, we're not interested.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:14:24):**  You know, we are so mission driven.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:14:26):**  We do what we want to do because, et cetera.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:14:29):**  And then suddenly they said 40 million and then they still said no.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:14:32):**  60, they still said no. 80, they still said no.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:14:35):**  And then they asked them, you know, what, is there a price at which you are selling  
**[0:14:40-0:14:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:14:40):**  or are you not just not selling or what's going on?  
**[0:14:42-0:14:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:14:42):**  Because in the meantime, even the CEO of LinkedIn had spoken to them and they, and they thought  
**[0:14:49-0:14:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:14:49):**  about it and said, well, maybe, you know, a nine digit number.  
**[0:14:51-0:14:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:14:51):**  And then they said a hundred million and said, wait a minute, that's the first nine digit  
**[0:14:54-0:14:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:14:54):**  number.  
**[0:14:55-0:14:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:14:55):**  That's not what we meant.  
**[0:14:57-0:15:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:14:57):**  And they said, okay, then you come up with a number because they really wanted to buy  
**[0:15:01-0:15:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:15:01):**  them because they thought that is, you know, we need a company.  
**[0:15:05-0:15:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:15:05):**  And they thought about it and said, well, maybe 120 million.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:15:07):**  They will never do this.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:15:09):**  This would be so crazy.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:15:11):**  Both founders were 23 and 26 year olds.  
**[0:15:14-0:15:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:15:14):**  Now they are just a little bit older.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:15:15):**  So it's, and then LinkedIn said, no, you know, that's not possible.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:15:20):**  But of course, three days later they got a text message.  
**[0:15:23-0:15:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:15:23):**  We do 120 and they had, they couldn't sleep at night and they sat together, the founders  
**[0:15:30-0:15:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:15:30):**  with their employees.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:15:31):**  They calculated how much everybody would get.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:15:33):**  And then they thought, wait a minute, are we already done?  
**[0:15:36-0:15:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:15:36):**  Do we really, are we done with what we're doing here?  
**[0:15:39-0:15:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:15:39):**  No.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:15:40):**  And an advisor had asked them that question.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:15:42):**  Are you done?  
**[0:15:43-0:15:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:15:43):**  And they said, no, of course not.  
**[0:15:44-0:15:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:15:44):**  We still want to do self management, decentralized work, you know, all these things that we're  
**[0:15:48-0:15:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:15:48):**  doing and, and continuing with our mission.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:15:51):**  And he said, well, then you can't sell.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:15:53):**  And then they ended up not selling, but it was such a tough process.  
**[0:15:57-0:16:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:15:57):**  The founder who negotiated with LinkedIn, he said, you know, he had to meditate so often  
**[0:16:03-0:16:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:16:03):**  before he actually got on the call with LinkedIn, he, he had this text like by heart that what  
**[0:16:10-0:16:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:16:10):**  he would say, et cetera, because it's so many forces inside you go crazy.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:16:16):**  If you're saying to somebody, no, I, as a founder, co-founder don't want to have 60  
**[0:16:21-0:16:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:16:21):**  million on the bank account tomorrow.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:16:23):**  And the other co-founder neither.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:16:25):**  You know, what, what kind of, how many soul forces and psychological forces are we, it's  
**[0:16:31-0:16:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:16:31):**  very difficult to imagine.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:16:33):**  And it's, it's a very difficult technique that capitalism in that sense is, is using  
**[0:16:39-0:16:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:16:39):**  there basically corrupting people, I would say by these enormous numbers and only, only  
**[0:16:46-0:16:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:16:46):**  the ones that are really, that are young enough, I would say, and internally strong enough  
**[0:16:50-0:16:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:16:50):**  can say no to that.  
**[0:16:52-0:16:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:16:52):**  And I don't blame anybody who, who uses the opportunity and sells.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:16:58):**  And as you said, especially one industry is currently under attack.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:17:04):**  And that's of course the industry that you're also working in the organic food industry  
**[0:17:08-0:17:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:17:08):**  and agriculture industry with all the pioneers who really wanted to change the world.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:17:13):**  And now for years, nobody was interested in their companies.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:17:18):**  And now suddenly everybody becomes interested in wants to buy them.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:17:22):**  And but what's interesting there is I think you have to make your, you have to make your  
**[0:17:29-0:17:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:17:29):**  calculation also with the customers.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:17:32):**  I don't know whether you saw that in Germany, there's this one of the largest natural care  
**[0:17:40-0:17:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:17:40):**  and natural cosmetic companies, Logona was sold to L'Oreal just a few weeks ago.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:17:47):**  And a customer heard about it.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:17:50):**  Of course.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:17:52):**  And what you saw is customers were outraged.  
**[0:17:55-0:17:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:17:55):**  You know, they were the ones who built that brand.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:17:57):**  They went to organic supermarkets and organic cosmetic stores for years over years.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:18:07):**  They asked, where's this brand?  
**[0:18:09-0:18:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:18:09):**  I want to buy it.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:18:10):**  They build it.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:18:11):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:18:12):**  Where's this brand?  
**[0:18:13-0:18:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:18:13):**  They paid much more for that brand.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:18:14):**  They were stuck in traffic to go to that one little shop in the corner of the city 10 years  
**[0:18:20-0:18:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:18:20):**  ago when it wasn't sold everywhere.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:18:22):**  So these were the people who were really, really fans of it and helped this brand.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:18:27):**  And now once it's profitable, so what you saw is actually a big shitstorm and actually  
**[0:18:33-0:18:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:18:33):**  organic supermarkets letting customers vote whether they should throw it out or not.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:18:38):**  And 80 percent voted yes, throw them out.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:18:40):**  We don't want to see them anymore.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:18:42):**  So it's interesting.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:18:43):**  It's we are getting into a time where it's important for your brand how you are owned.  
**[0:18:49-0:18:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:18:49):**  And if you're owned by a multinational company because you're selling to them, it will definitely  
**[0:18:53-0:18:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:18:53):**  damage your brand.  
**[0:18:55-0:18:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:18:55):**  And so do you have an example in that?  
**[0:18:57-0:18:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:18:57):**  I know there are some.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:18:58):**  And can you talk about one or two for the pioneering companies that have been around  
**[0:19:02-0:19:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:19:02):**  for a few decades, especially in the organic space?  
**[0:19:05-0:19:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:19:05):**  I mean, you can see the ones that started, let's say, 30 years ago and now a founder  
**[0:19:09-0:19:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:19:09):**  or maybe a management team has come to an age where it also starts to be interesting  
**[0:19:14-0:19:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:19:14):**  to think about pension and retiring, although the mission, of course, is still not completed.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:19:20):**  What do you do with a company that wants to transition to steward ownership?  
**[0:19:26-0:19:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:19:26):**  And how do you make that work also from the investor side of things and still sort of  
**[0:19:30-0:19:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:19:30):**  take care of the pension, maybe not with two, three, four hundred million, but with enough  
**[0:19:35-0:19:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:19:35):**  to live comfortably for the founder?  
**[0:19:37-0:19:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:19:37):**  A fair return.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:19:38):**  Yeah.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:19:39):**  Yeah.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:19:40):**  Maybe maybe one good example there is organically grown company OGC in the US, Portland, Oregon.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:19:48):**  That's the second largest organic produce wholesaler in the US, I think.  
**[0:19:54-0:20:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:19:54):**  And with only 200 million in revenue and 200 employees, they were founded as a co-op by  
**[0:20:02-0:20:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:20:02):**  farmers already 30 years ago.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:20:06):**  And then they transformed to ESOP ownership, Employee Stock Option Plan, and the US a very  
**[0:20:13-0:20:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:20:13):**  particular plan.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:20:15):**  And now they were actually in a very dangerous situation because first, part of the shareholders  
**[0:20:24-0:20:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:20:24):**  were former farmers, former employees, so people who weren't anymore really connected  
**[0:20:31-0:20:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:20:31):**  to the company and were interested in a pension.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:20:35):**  And then you had the ESOP plan getting close to 51 percent.  
**[0:20:39-0:20:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:20:39):**  And the problem in the US is ESOP, in the ESOP plan, employees can't vote themselves.  
**[0:20:45-0:20:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:20:45):**  They just get the benefits.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:20:46):**  That's the pension plan for them.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:20:48):**  But a trustee votes and the trustee is obliged by law to always vote and use his voting power  
**[0:20:56-0:20:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:20:56):**  and to maximize profits for the employees.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:20:58):**  That means if he gets an offer, for example, by Amazon or selling would be the maximum  
**[0:21:03-0:21:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:21:03):**  profit.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:21:04):**  He has to do it.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:21:05):**  He has to sell.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:21:06):**  You cannot get around it.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:21:09):**  And that's when they realized, oh, damn, you know, we are in a very dangerous situation  
**[0:21:12-0:21:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:21:12):**  around us.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:21:13):**  All of the organic pioneers are bought up by, you know, seven generations was bought  
**[0:21:20-0:21:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:21:20):**  up.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:21:21):**  You know, that Whole Foods was bought by Amazon, et cetera.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:21:24):**  We have to change something.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:21:25):**  And they looked around and said, OK, we want to actually set up something like steward  
**[0:21:29-0:21:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:21:29):**  ownership.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:21:30):**  So the steering wheel of the company isn't a tradable commodity anymore.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:21:35):**  And the other thing that they realized, actually, is once they went into this ESOP plan a few  
**[0:21:42-0:21:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:21:42):**  years in, people started to behave a little bit differently because they had an internal  
**[0:21:49-0:21:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:21:49):**  conflict.  
**[0:21:50-0:21:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:21:50):**  They were employees.  
**[0:21:51-0:21:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:21:51):**  They were stewards of the company, yes, but they were also interested and they were also  
**[0:21:56-0:21:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:21:56):**  pension holders and investors.  
**[0:21:58-0:22:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:21:58):**  And sometimes this conflict became apparent that they were actually thinking of the company  
**[0:22:03-0:22:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:22:03):**  as investors and not anymore as stewards.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:22:06):**  So there was this little strange thing.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:22:08):**  So they thought, OK, we don't want to have investors or employees as investors.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:22:12):**  We want to make sure they really can be stewards.  
**[0:22:15-0:22:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:22:15):**  And they looked for a good ownership structure in the US.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:22:19):**  And what they found is a very, very unknown structure.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:22:24):**  It's a perpetual purpose trust.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:22:26):**  That means it's a trust that, unlike all other trusts, doesn't have any beneficiaries, any  
**[0:22:34-0:22:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:22:34):**  natural persons as beneficiaries, but it has a purpose.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:22:38):**  In that case, it's organic agriculture as the purpose.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:22:41):**  And it's perpetual.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:22:42):**  So it doesn't end.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:22:45):**  And they set this up.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:22:47):**  And now the question was, how can we get the company in there?  
**[0:22:49-0:22:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:22:49):**  And that's when they needed financing and also a new kind of financing.  
**[0:22:54-0:23:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:22:54):**  They needed basically alternative buyout capital, alternative private equity and capital in  
**[0:23:03-0:23:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:23:03):**  order to buy out some of the old investors.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:23:06):**  And that's when we went in there and we negotiated with them.  
**[0:23:09-0:23:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:23:09):**  And the former owners or some of the former employees and farmers said, well, we don't  
**[0:23:15-0:23:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:23:15):**  want the full valuation.  
**[0:23:17-0:23:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:23:17):**  We can be much lower, et cetera.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:23:19):**  And so we found a good way.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:23:21):**  Some also helped basically exchange their shares for a new class of shares.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:23:28):**  And it was financed through a mix of that and equity.  
**[0:23:33-0:23:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:23:33):**  And but the equity side, of course, must be very different because if you want to make  
**[0:23:39-0:23:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:23:39):**  sure that is now maybe the interesting part here.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:23:43):**  Yeah.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:23:44):**  How do you invest in this without taking the steering wheel away again?  
**[0:23:48-0:23:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:23:48):**  Exactly.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:23:49):**  Without taking the steering wheel.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:23:50):**  Because the usual way of investing and that's what we all learned.  
**[0:23:55-0:23:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:23:55):**  You give money, you get power.  
**[0:23:57-0:23:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:23:57):**  Very simple.  
**[0:23:58-0:23:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:23:58):**  Money equals power.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:23:59):**  That's the equation of capitalism.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:24:00):**  So that's how investment functions.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:24:03):**  And now they are saying, wait a minute, you don't get power because the power is held  
**[0:24:08-0:24:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:24:08):**  in trust by distrust.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:24:09):**  So OK, that's a hard pill to swallow for some investors.  
**[0:24:14-0:24:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:24:14):**  It's super scary because basically you have to trust literally that the processes of the  
**[0:24:18-0:24:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:24:18):**  trust work to come along in the long run.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:24:21):**  Well, yeah, exactly.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:24:23):**  And also interesting for you.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:24:24):**  Yeah, but there are also other instruments that can reduce the need of only trust and  
**[0:24:30-0:24:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:24:30):**  it can give you a bit more security.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:24:32):**  But indeed, one important process is can we make sure that the perpetual purpose trust  
**[0:24:37-0:24:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:24:37):**  in that case, the steward owner has a good governance structure and we help them to design  
**[0:24:42-0:24:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:24:42):**  that.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:24:43):**  It's a very interesting stakeholder governing structure.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:24:46):**  So both employees and farmers, suppliers that supply that supply most of their crops yearly  
**[0:24:58-0:24:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:24:58):**  to O.G.C.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:24:59):**  They can be they are considered stakeholders and then they can vote people to the to the  
**[0:25:06-0:25:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:25:06):**  Trust Protector Committee.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:25:07):**  That's what it's called.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:25:09):**  But of course, we said, you know, guys, we need some kind of other protections.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:25:12):**  We don't know whether you because we are now holding shares as purpose.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:25:17):**  We are now holding shares.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:25:18):**  But what does it help to have shares with some dividend rights without any voting rights  
**[0:25:24-0:25:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:25:24):**  if you can basically decide whether you distribute dividends or not?  
**[0:25:28-0:25:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:25:28):**  So we need a certain security that one if you have free cash flow, you you're actually  
**[0:25:33-0:25:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:25:33):**  paying it out.  
**[0:25:34-0:25:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:25:34):**  So we said, OK, we're not interfering.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:25:37):**  We don't have any voting rights, but you should give us a certain security that once you have  
**[0:25:41-0:25:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:25:41):**  free cash flow, you you are paying it out.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:25:43):**  At least in that case, it was five percent needs to be paid out.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:25:47):**  And then there's a certain waterfall that they can use the money to reinvest, help their  
**[0:25:53-0:25:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:25:53):**  farmers, help the employees, give them a little bit better, you know, flexible pay, et cetera.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:25:59):**  And then once that is done, we get even more return, six percent.  
**[0:26:03-0:26:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:26:03):**  And then, you know, there's a certain waterfall that we negotiated through.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:26:08):**  You have to do this thing then already in advance.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:26:12):**  The question of how do you distribute the money?  
**[0:26:16-0:26:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:26:16):**  And that gave us and also other investors who were participating in this 10 million  
**[0:26:23-0:26:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:26:23):**  preferred equity round enough security.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:26:27):**  But yeah, as you said, it's for some, it's definitely still very scary.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:26:32):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:26:33):**  And that seems to be your I mean, this is the way you're working.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:26:36):**  Not scary, but you're you're advising, you're working with companies, either startups and  
**[0:26:41-0:26:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:26:41):**  larger ones to to get them through that process, which is much more than just being the investor.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:26:46):**  But of course, the governance structure and all the structures around have to be either  
**[0:26:51-0:26:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:26:51):**  invented or rediscovered, like in this case, this perpetual purpose trust.  
**[0:26:56-0:26:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:26:56):**  And then everybody has to be comfortable with that.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:26:58):**  And so I imagine it's a that's quite a lot of work.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:27:01):**  Yeah.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:27:02):**  And I'm excited to you have been doing this investing part with startups for over the  
**[0:27:07-0:27:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:27:07):**  last years.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:27:08):**  And now you're working on a fund.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:27:10):**  Can you tell a bit more about that?  
**[0:27:11-0:27:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:27:11):**  And what what that is looking at?  
**[0:27:14-0:27:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:27:14):**  Yeah, I know.  
**[0:27:15-0:27:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:27:15):**  Happy to do that.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:27:16):**  And so as you said, over the last years, we we invested in around 10 companies more in  
**[0:27:23-0:27:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:27:23):**  the startup space companies that said, we want to be student like Ecosia, but we still  
**[0:27:28-0:27:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:27:28):**  need to grow.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:27:29):**  Can you finance us without taking without us needing to sell our soul and our values  
**[0:27:35-0:27:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:27:35):**  and without giving you a track along ride and voting rights, et cetera?  
**[0:27:39-0:27:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:27:39):**  So we did this and this was quite just work quite well.  
**[0:27:43-0:27:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:27:43):**  But we realized there are actually many companies in the more mature space, high impact companies  
**[0:27:52-0:28:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:27:52):**  that somehow have grown and that that now after years of successful business, they're  
**[0:28:00-0:28:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:28:00):**  thinking about succession and about long term ownership plans.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:28:04):**  And some of them are very, very open to steward ownership.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:28:07):**  Actually, they want steward ownership because they say, well, selling it doesn't what what  
**[0:28:14-0:28:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:28:14):**  would potentially undermine our mission drive and our and definitely our independence.  
**[0:28:21-0:28:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:28:21):**  I don't want it.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:28:22):**  I don't want to do a traditional IPO.  
**[0:28:24-0:28:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:28:24):**  I need something else, but I have to problem my investors still need some kind of liquidity  
**[0:28:31-0:28:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:28:31):**  or you know, my co-founder is crazy.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:28:35):**  He doesn't want to do that.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:28:36):**  He wants the highest valuation or whatever.  
**[0:28:38-0:28:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:28:38):**  So you have all kinds of obstacles in the way.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:28:42):**  But and we said, OK, these people, we need to be able to help.  
**[0:28:46-0:28:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:28:46):**  And there is nobody around and no private equity fund that is actually helping basically  
**[0:28:51-0:28:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:28:51):**  to companies to set up foundation ownership, steward ownership, alternative buyout capital,  
**[0:28:58-0:29:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:28:58):**  like you mentioned before, which is super alternative, obviously.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:29:01):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:29:03-0:29:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:29:03):**  It's not really there.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:29:04):**  And that's when we said, OK, actually, we need to set up a special vehicle that can  
**[0:29:08-0:29:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:29:08):**  do that.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:29:09):**  And that's when we sat together with the GLS Bank.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:29:12):**  That's the largest sustainable bank in Germany.  
**[0:29:13-0:29:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:29:13):**  We talked with them about it and said, OK, that's a very good idea.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:29:19):**  We want to support that.  
**[0:29:22-0:29:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:29:22):**  And we found and then one of the guys, Daniel Formolka, who was the co-founder of the Traders  
**[0:29:29-0:29:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:29:29):**  Organic Growth Fund.  
**[0:29:31-0:29:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:29:31):**  That is, yeah, as you probably know, also an evergreen fund.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:29:35):**  But that's not really focused on these ownership structures and actually not able to invest  
**[0:29:39-0:29:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:29:39):**  in these kinds of ownership structures, as we found out.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:29:43):**  In one case, we even, it's another story, we had to buy them out because they were blocking  
**[0:29:48-0:29:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:29:48):**  it.  
**[0:29:49-0:29:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:29:49):**  But that's, as I said, another story.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:29:51):**  For another time.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:29:52):**  For another time.  
**[0:29:53-0:29:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:29:53):**  But so Daniel Formolka joined us and we said, OK, let's set up something that we call now  
**[0:29:58-0:30:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:29:58):**  Purpose Evergreen Capital.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:30:00):**  So it's an evergreen structure.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:30:02):**  It's not a typical fund.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:30:04):**  We got an exception from the German regulators that we're not regulated as a fund, but more  
**[0:30:09-0:30:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:30:09):**  as a holding company because it's more holding.  
**[0:30:12-0:30:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:30:12):**  Because otherwise you would have your 10 plus 2 plus 2 maybe, but who knows what's happened  
**[0:30:17-0:30:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:30:17):**  in 14 years.  
**[0:30:18-0:30:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:30:18):**  You'll be structured completely opposite to the way you're trying to invest as an alternative  
**[0:30:23-0:30:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:30:23):**  buyout fund.  
**[0:30:24-0:30:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:30:24):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:30:25-0:30:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:30:25):**  We want to be able to think in the long term, to invest in the companies and if one, stick  
**[0:30:33-0:30:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:30:33):**  around, if not, go out again, but not have this kind of pressure because that kind of  
**[0:30:40-0:30:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:30:40):**  closed end fund structure, as you mentioned, is one of the reasons why we're selling companies  
**[0:30:46-0:30:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:30:46):**  again and again and again and where they can't just be in calm waters and have a long term  
**[0:30:54-0:30:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:30:54):**  owner.  
**[0:30:55-0:30:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:30:55):**  So we said, OK, that can't be the structure.  
**[0:30:58-0:31:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:30:58):**  And now the structure is, will be, as I said, evergreen.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:31:03):**  That means liquidity for investors is achieved through a secondary market and through buyback  
**[0:31:08-0:31:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:31:08):**  windows, yearly buyback windows.  
**[0:31:12-0:31:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:31:12):**  And the secondary market is organized by the GLS Bank.  
**[0:31:16-0:31:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:31:16):**  And the fund, obviously the fund has to be of a certain size.  
**[0:31:20-0:31:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:31:20):**  We said we're going to start with a more smaller size with 30 million, 30, 35 million.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:31:26):**  And now and that means we can only, all the investments we do, we have to do as co-investors  
**[0:31:33-0:31:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:31:33):**  because even such an OGC deal within total 20 million needs, of course, much more.  
**[0:31:40-0:31:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:31:40):**  But that's also what we like.  
**[0:31:41-0:31:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:31:41):**  We like to convince other investors and help them to understand these kinds of steward  
**[0:31:46-0:31:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:31:46):**  ownership models.  
**[0:31:47-0:31:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:31:47):**  That's also what we see as our pioneer role.  
**[0:31:49-0:31:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:31:49):**  And we also help our investors to co-invest in our portfolio companies.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:31:57):**  And the fund basically has this aim of helping some lighthouse companies and helping high-impact  
**[0:32:05-0:32:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:32:05):**  companies that want to make sure they can stay on mission, they can stay independent  
**[0:32:13-0:32:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:32:13):**  and really make sure their values are enshrined in the charter, help them to do that.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:32:20):**  Because otherwise, I think, you know, we somehow lose a lot of what we've built because, you  
**[0:32:26-0:32:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:32:26):**  know, so many impact investors and go in, measure, measure, measure, make sure the company  
**[0:32:33-0:32:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:32:33):**  makes an impact and then they go out and then what?  
**[0:32:37-0:32:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:32:37):**  I think that's like a loose end.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:32:40):**  We somehow need to think through the entire lifecycle of a company and we need to make  
**[0:32:44-0:32:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:32:44):**  sure that the years in which the company is big and is particularly impactful, you know,  
**[0:32:49-0:32:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:32:49):**  these years don't become the years of selling out and of losing your mission, etc.  
**[0:32:59-0:33:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:32:59):**  So a company reaches this certain size of maturity, etc.  
**[0:33:03-0:33:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:33:03):**  And that's when it's achieving the most impact.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:33:06):**  And that's also often when it's actually being sold and that's not achieving anymore.  
**[0:33:10-0:33:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:33:10):**  So that's the fat years for the impact.  
**[0:33:12-0:33:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:33:12):**  Exactly.  
**[0:33:13-0:33:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:33:13):**  And that's when it's undermined.  
**[0:33:14-0:33:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:33:14):**  Yeah.  
**[0:33:15-0:33:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:33:15):**  And then you can say, well, come on, you know, there are also buyers who are nice and will  
**[0:33:20-0:33:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:33:20):**  make sure.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:33:21):**  And you create a lot of capital for the founders that probably have a certain set of values  
**[0:33:24-0:33:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:33:24):**  and might invest it interestingly as well.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:33:27):**  Of course, there's a second part to this.  
**[0:33:29-0:33:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:33:29):**  No, that's true.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:33:31):**  And I totally admit there is a trade off.  
**[0:33:34-0:33:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:33:34):**  Probably some of your investors in the fund now have maybe sold the company at some point  
**[0:33:38-0:33:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:33:38):**  and are now able to do that.  
**[0:33:40-0:33:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:33:40):**  Exactly.  
**[0:33:41-0:33:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:33:41):**  You know, I don't I think that is totally legitimate for you just have to make the trade  
**[0:33:47-0:33:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:33:47):**  off yourself.  
**[0:33:48-0:33:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:33:48):**  You have to think about what's more impactful, is more impactful to sell it and then have  
**[0:33:52-0:33:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:33:52):**  the money and do something with it.  
**[0:33:54-0:34:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:33:54):**  Or is it more impactful to have a company that is that can stay true to its value?  
**[0:34:00-0:34:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:34:00):**  A lot of employees that won't get under the wheels of a new regime of investors who are  
**[0:34:09-0:34:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:34:09):**  really short term interested.  
**[0:34:10-0:34:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:34:10):**  And it's suppliers because sometimes you are I think you're misjudging this by only looking  
**[0:34:17-0:34:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:34:17):**  at your company, but your company is better than ecosystem.  
**[0:34:19-0:34:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:34:19):**  And it has a tremendous effect on the entire ecosystem.  
**[0:34:22-0:34:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:34:22):**  I can give you an example from the organic food industry.  
**[0:34:26-0:34:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:34:26):**  So again, this is a global.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:34:31):**  I mentioned it's a very interesting case because the founder of Logona and I don't know, I  
**[0:34:36-0:34:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:34:36):**  think it's only a 60 million revenue company, but still it's an unknown brand in many countries.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:34:44):**  The owner thought, OK, you know, I want to get out.  
**[0:34:46-0:34:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:34:46):**  I sell it to very value aligned investors.  
**[0:34:48-0:34:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:34:48):**  And there was a group of investors who said, yeah, we're super value aligned.  
**[0:34:51-0:34:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:34:51):**  We want to keep it independent.  
**[0:34:53-0:34:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:34:53):**  It's nice.  
**[0:34:54-0:34:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:34:54):**  Thank you.  
**[0:34:55-0:34:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:34:55):**  Here's the money.  
**[0:34:56-0:34:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:34:56):**  What happened just two years from then?  
**[0:34:59-0:35:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:34:59):**  They sold it to L'Oreal, which is partly owned by Nestle, 23 percent.  
**[0:35:05-0:35:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:35:05):**  In two years, their whole values had changed of the investors.  
**[0:35:08-0:35:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:35:08):**  Yeah, the entire game changed.  
**[0:35:11-0:35:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:35:11):**  And now what happens in the industry is that they are, of course, applying different sales  
**[0:35:17-0:35:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:35:17):**  techniques, different that, you know, the organic food sector has this different way  
**[0:35:23-0:35:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:35:23):**  of, I would say, dealing with each other, more cooperative, you know, not as hard as  
**[0:35:30-0:35:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:35:30):**  that you're not suing your competitor the whole time, et cetera.  
**[0:35:34-0:35:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:35:34):**  But now we're getting increasingly these companies that are owned by the big multinationals in  
**[0:35:41-0:35:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:35:41):**  that space and they're behaving completely differently.  
**[0:35:43-0:35:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:35:43):**  They are not any more bound to that implicit contract, basically that implicit cooperation  
**[0:35:50-0:35:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:35:50):**  contract that all of them have.  
**[0:35:52-0:35:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:35:52):**  And it destroys an entire ecosystem.  
**[0:35:55-0:35:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:35:55):**  So it's not as easy to just say, well, it's just my company.  
**[0:35:58-0:36:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:35:58):**  I think it's yet a many, many, many things connected to it because we're living in a  
**[0:36:04-0:36:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:36:04):**  complex system, a complex world.  
**[0:36:07-0:36:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:36:07):**  And I want to be conscious of your time and end with one final question.  
**[0:36:10-0:36:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:36:10):**  If you could wave your magic wand and change one thing in the food and agriculture system  
**[0:36:16-0:36:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:36:16):**  from the sustainability point of view or from the long term, I mean, that's pretty much  
**[0:36:20-0:36:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:36:20):**  the same.  
**[0:36:21-0:36:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:36:21):**  What would that be?  
**[0:36:22-0:36:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:36:22):**  So one thing in the organic agriculture system, also the food system and the cosmetics system,  
**[0:36:28-0:36:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:36:28):**  cosmetics obviously are or should be all deprived from natural ingredients, should be all coming  
**[0:36:33-0:36:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:36:33):**  from natural ingredients.  
**[0:36:34-0:36:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:36:34):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:36:36):**  I think I would make sure, so the one thing probably most impactful would be to have a  
**[0:36:46-0:36:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:36:46):**  law that basically makes farmland steward owned in that sense.  
**[0:36:52-0:36:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:36:52):**  So everything that I was talking about, companies now that for land and that's very simple to  
**[0:36:58-0:37:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:36:58):**  do that by law.  
**[0:37:00-0:37:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:37:00):**  Some countries have that already.  
**[0:37:03-0:37:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:37:03):**  Helping making sure that this land can only be held by people in trust as stewards and  
**[0:37:12-0:37:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:37:12):**  doesn't become a speculative commodity, what we see often with enormous prices, etc.  
**[0:37:18-0:37:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:37:18):**  So I think that's what I do.  
**[0:37:20-0:37:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:37:20):**  And if I had another wish free, I would then say, OK, then we need a legal form for these  
**[0:37:26-0:37:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:37:26):**  food and agriculture companies that makes steward ownership much more simple.  
**[0:37:31-0:37:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:37:31):**  Also as a company.  
**[0:37:32-0:37:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:37:32):**  Because that's what you see often, right?  
**[0:37:33-0:37:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:37:33):**  It's very difficult to do and you have to jump through all kinds of hoops and come up  
**[0:37:37-0:37:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:37:37):**  with creative ways for something that should be so much more simple and straightforward.  
**[0:37:42-0:37:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:37:42):**  Exactly.  
**[0:37:43-0:37:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:37:43):**  It's a natural need.  
**[0:37:44-0:37:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:37:44):**  But all of the legal forms for land, but also for companies, both are somehow designed for  
**[0:37:50-0:37:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:37:50):**  a different system, for a different age.  
**[0:37:53-0:38:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:37:53):**  They were designed when capitalism was really just starting and it was all around making  
**[0:38:02-0:38:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:38:02):**  profit.  
**[0:38:03-0:38:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:38:03):**  And now we have entrepreneurs and people who think profit is necessary, yes, but it's  
**[0:38:08-0:38:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:38:08):**  a means to an end, but all the legal forms are somehow still from these old times.  
**[0:38:14-0:38:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:38:14):**  So yes, it's super hard to do it differently.  
**[0:38:18-0:38:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:38:18):**  And I think my example that I gave from OGC and from others can show a little bit how  
**[0:38:27-0:38:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:38:27):**  somehow strange and also difficult it is to convince other people to understand it.  
**[0:38:37-0:38:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:38:37):**  It's a big thing and that's why a new form, a new legal form would make it much more simple  
**[0:38:42-0:38:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:38:42):**  because you have them an understanding and you don't have to design around with hundreds  
**[0:38:50-0:38:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:38:50):**  of different new forms that nobody knows.  
**[0:38:53-0:38:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:38:53):**  Is the B Corp movement in some, I know some countries or some states have it as a legal  
**[0:38:58-0:39:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:38:58):**  entity now, but is that that falls in the same direction or it's part of the same movement?  
**[0:39:05-0:39:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:39:05):**  I think the B Corp movement is a great movement, but their main aim is to enshrine certain  
**[0:39:13-0:39:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:39:13):**  purposes and values into the charter.  
**[0:39:16-0:39:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:39:16):**  But they are not asking what I would call the power question.  
**[0:39:20-0:39:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:39:20):**  The steward ownership is asking the power question, who has the power in our companies?  
**[0:39:25-0:39:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:39:25):**  Who has the power in organizations we're all spending most of our time in?  
**[0:39:29-0:39:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:39:29):**  Are these people who can buy the power?  
**[0:39:31-0:39:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:39:31):**  So is this money?  
**[0:39:32-0:39:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:39:32):**  Is this the principle of money or are these people who just by chance inherit the power?  
**[0:39:39-0:39:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:39:39):**  Is this the principle of blood or do we have another principle, a principle of purpose  
**[0:39:43-0:39:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:39:43):**  or stewardship that someone makes sure there are always people that are able and values  
**[0:39:49-0:39:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:39:49):**  aligned, ability and value relatives, so different kind of families so to speak, that are getting  
**[0:39:58-0:39:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:39:58):**  the power there.  
**[0:39:59-0:40:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:39:59):**  So that's that deep power question.  
**[0:40:02-0:40:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:40:02):**  That's not really what B Corp is interested in, obviously, which is totally fine.  
**[0:40:08-0:40:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:40:08):**  But that's why I think it's still necessary to go beyond B Corp.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:40:14):**  And I want to thank you so much.  
**[0:40:15-0:40:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:40:15):**  I will definitely link the interview I did with Thomas Rippel on farmland and also the  
**[0:40:19-0:40:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:40:19):**  Agrarian Trust I did on farmland investing and farmland commodities and speculation below  
**[0:40:26-0:40:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:40:26):**  in the description.  
**[0:40:27-0:40:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:40:27):**  I want to thank you so much for your time.  
**[0:40:28-0:40:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:40:28):**  I know it is one of the most busiest weeks you have in this year with the fund, with  
**[0:40:33-0:40:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:40:33):**  a lot of other projects and a big conference coming up.  
**[0:40:36-0:40:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:40:36):**  And there's much more to discuss, but I'm looking forward to check in again soon and  
**[0:40:41-0:40:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:40:41):**  discuss more on this often forgotten part of the power question and dive deeper into  
**[0:40:47-0:40:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:40:47):**  that.  
**[0:40:48-0:40:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:40:48):**  Thank you, Gun.  
**[0:40:50-0:40:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:40:50):**  Thank you for listening to this interview.  
**[0:40:51-0:40:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:40:51):**  And I hope you learned something about an often forgotten subject, ownership structures.  
**[0:40:56-0:41:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:40:56):**  So next time you are investing in a company or next time you're starting a company or  
**[0:41:01-0:41:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:41:01):**  next time you're taking over a company, dare to ask the power question, who is controlling  
**[0:41:07-0:41:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:41:07):**  the steering wheel?  
**[0:41:08-0:41:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:41:08):**  Not the most sexy subject, but definitely crucial.  
**[0:41:12-0:41:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:41:12):**  Thank you for listening all the way till the end.  
**[0:41:13-0:41:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:41:13):**  I hope it was interesting and relevant to you.  
**[0:41:26-0:41:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/#t=0:41:26):**  Dear friends of the podcast, I'm super excited to share with you the online video course

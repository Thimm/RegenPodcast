### Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food  (Mon, 28 Dec 2020 14:00:00)
## What we learned in 2020 on nutrition, inequality, ownership, health, agroforestry, profitability, soil  
**[0:00:00-0:00:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative  
**[0:00:03-0:00:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:00:03):**  food and agriculture, follow our video course via investing in regenerative  
**[0:00:07-0:00:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:00:07):**  agriculture.com slash course, or in the links below now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:00:13):**  Welcome to the audio version of what we learned in 2020 on nutrition, inequality,  
**[0:00:18-0:00:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:00:18):**  ownership, health, agroforestry, profitability, soil, and so much more.  
**[0:00:23-0:00:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:00:23):**  If you want to see all the links, find the link to the show notes  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:00:27):**  in the description below. Wow.  
**[0:00:31-0:00:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:00:31):**  This was a very, very intense year.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:00:33):**  It's hard to believe it was only 12 months.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:00:36):**  I hope you and your loved ones haven't been personally  
**[0:00:38-0:00:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:00:38):**  affected by the health crisis.  
**[0:00:40-0:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:00:40):**  The attention for food and agriculture has absolutely exploded and many of our  
**[0:00:44-0:00:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:00:44):**  eating habits have completely changed.  
**[0:00:47-0:00:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:00:47):**  Everyone who is selling directly and indirectly to consumers had to deal with  
**[0:00:50-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:00:50):**  a massive growth, which can be obviously really, really tough, but on the flip  
**[0:00:54-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:00:54):**  side, everyone who was selling to restaurants, et cetera, had to completely  
**[0:00:58-0:01:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:00:58):**  shift their operation, which hasn't been easy as well.  
**[0:01:01-0:01:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:01:01):**  So it's safe to say that it wasn't an easy year for anyone.  
**[0:01:04-0:01:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:01:04):**  Even if you haven't been personally affected by the health crisis, it's  
**[0:01:07-0:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:01:07):**  been very, very difficult to pick the key lessons from over 40 long  
**[0:01:11-0:01:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:01:11):**  interviews we did more than eight webinars and a complete series on  
**[0:01:14-0:01:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:01:14):**  transition finance for farmers.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:01:17):**  So let's get a cup of tea and give it a try.  
**[0:01:19-0:01:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:01:19):**  First up health, even in a year where almost every conversation we had was  
**[0:01:23-0:01:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:01:23):**  about our health, there's still hardly any attention for the potential for food  
**[0:01:28-0:01:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:01:28):**  as prevention or preventive medicine.  
**[0:01:30-0:01:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:01:30):**  This really, really blows my mind.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:01:33):**  Zegbuss joined us to discuss why all health issues come back to how we treat  
**[0:01:38-0:01:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:01:38):**  the soil and what's actually in our food.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:01:40):**  Greg Schumacher came back to share his latest learnings and it absolutely  
**[0:01:45-0:01:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:01:45):**  shocked him to see how fast nutrients disappear when something is harvested.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:01:49):**  And the huge differences there are between organic and non-organic when  
**[0:01:53-0:01:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:01:53):**  measured on the farm, but interestingly enough, not on the supermarket shelf.  
**[0:01:57-0:01:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:01:57):**  So a lot more research is needed there.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:02:00):**  We also took a deep dive into animal protein as a preventive medicine with  
**[0:02:03-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:02:03):**  Pierre Biel.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:02:04):**  Pierre started two clinical trials with COVID-19 patients and in older people  
**[0:02:08-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:02:08):**  with the aim to evaluate whether omega-3 diet enrichment, basically meaning  
**[0:02:13-0:02:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:02:13):**  regenerative farmed animals,  
**[0:02:14-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:02:14):**  animal protein could protect patients against severe forms of COVID-19.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:02:19):**  Extremely fascinating.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:02:20):**  And obviously we need to follow up to see how those clinical trials have been going.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:02:24):**  You can see a full list of interviews on nutrient density in the links below.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:02:29):**  Ownership, inequality, access, racism, and discrimination.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:02:32):**  Of course we all knew this wasn't a fair world, but in our little bubble,  
**[0:02:36-0:02:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:02:36):**  it was very easy and convenient to forget just how unfair it really is.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:02:41):**  In the interview with Chris Newman, where we discussed his work at Sylvan  
**[0:02:43-0:02:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:02:43):**  Aquifer Farms, we only scratched the surface.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:02:46):**  Chris didn't only blew up the myth of the single family farm, which was about  
**[0:02:50-0:02:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:02:50):**  time, but also made it painfully clear that the current farming system in the  
**[0:02:54-0:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:02:54):**  global North is extremely, and this is capital letters, unfair.  
**[0:02:58-0:02:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:02:58):**  And this is an understatement.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:02:59):**  Plus most importantly, what to do about it.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:03:01):**  Hint, invest in indigenous collectives as soon as possible.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:03:06):**  If you're interested in ag at all, do yourself a favor, follow Chris and Sarah  
**[0:03:10-0:03:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:03:10):**  Mock and the collective on Instagram.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:03:12):**  Find the links below.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:03:14):**  And if you haven't, please do listen to this episode.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:03:17):**  It might make you feel quite uncomfortable, which is good.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:03:20):**  And let me know your feedback after having a listen.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:03:23):**  Profits.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:03:24):**  Can you make money with regenerative farming?  
**[0:03:26-0:03:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:03:26):**  Probably the question we get the most.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:03:28):**  And the answer is simple, but very complex.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:03:30):**  Yes, you absolutely can.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:03:31):**  But it, of course there's always a but.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:03:33):**  Completely depends on the context.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:03:35):**  We had Jonathan Lundgren co-author of the only period reviewed paper  
**[0:03:39-0:03:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:03:39):**  comparing profitability of region versus extractive agriculture.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:03:43):**  He joined the podcast to talk about the financial profits and about other  
**[0:03:47-0:03:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:03:47):**  research coming out and why it's so difficult to do this type of research.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:03:51):**  I would say an absolutely fascinating interview.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:03:53):**  And what about feeding the world?  
**[0:03:55-0:03:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:03:55):**  Isn't regenerative slash organic slash agroecology slash permaculture  
**[0:03:59-0:04:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:03:59):**  fill in your own buzzword?  
**[0:04:00-0:04:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:04:00):**  Yielding a lot less.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:04:04):**  So we will all starve and have to cut down the last remaining rainforest.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:04:08):**  With Fabio Sakamoto, we discussed how to close the yield gap that in some  
**[0:04:12-0:04:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:04:12):**  cases is absolutely there between regenerative organic and extractive  
**[0:04:15-0:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:04:15):**  agriculture, in this case in grains and pulses in Brazil.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:04:19):**  And yes, again, it's absolutely possible.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:04:21):**  Don't let anybody tell you, you cannot feed the world while farming with nature.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:04:26):**  This doesn't mean it's easy.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:04:27):**  It's naturally more complex than we have time for here.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:04:29):**  But I did find a great short podcast.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:04:32):**  I think it's seven or eight minutes by Charles Eisenstein,  
**[0:04:34-0:04:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:04:34):**  where he tackles this issue.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:04:35):**  Again, the link you can find below.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:04:38):**  So big money is coming.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:04:39):**  Financial markets are waking up, but we're not there yet.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:04:41):**  We saw some great signs of progress this year.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:04:44):**  We saw the first green bond again by Fabio.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:04:46):**  Congrats Fabio focused on regenerative farming approaches in  
**[0:04:49-0:04:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:04:49):**  Brazil, severely oversubscribed.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:04:52):**  More than 200 million has been invested by 123 in agroforestry.  
**[0:04:56-0:05:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:04:56):**  Two interviews with Oliver Henke and Richard Fokken can be found below.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:05:00):**  Skin in the game transition finance by the perennial fund by Med-Ag.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:05:03):**  They're almost closing their first fund.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:05:05):**  Congrats to Brendan and Phil and the whole team, obviously at Med-Ag.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:05:09):**  And crowd investing is finally coming to us to allow retail investors,  
**[0:05:13-0:05:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:05:13):**  people like you and me to invest in regenerative transitions.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:05:16):**  You can find the interview with Dan Meder below.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:05:18):**  And big food companies are starting to pay attention.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:05:21):**  Congrats to Bastien on all the progress the Earthworm Foundation has been  
**[0:05:24-0:05:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:05:24):**  making with Nestle, Ferrero and many others.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:05:27):**  But, and there's always a but, these examples seem to be very small exceptions  
**[0:05:32-0:05:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:05:32):**  compared to the rest of the financial market, because the rest of the  
**[0:05:35-0:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:05:35):**  financial market hasn't really priced in the risks of extractive agriculture at all.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:05:41):**  We had a very interesting discussion with the people from Planet Tracker,  
**[0:05:45-0:05:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:05:45):**  Marc Campanale and Matt McLuckie, who painfully show us what is wrong with  
**[0:05:51-0:05:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:05:51):**  the current financial system and the pricing of agriculture and food.  
**[0:05:55-0:05:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:05:55):**  You can find more in the interview, but also on the Planet Tracker website.  
**[0:05:58-0:05:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:05:58):**  Definitely have a look.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:06:00):**  And I can hear many, many farmers thinking who are listening to this, that  
**[0:06:05-0:06:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:06:05):**  basically when they're discussing with their local bank representative, that  
**[0:06:09-0:06:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:06:09):**  they are educating them on soil and what regenerative farming actually means.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:06:12):**  We're absolutely not in a position where a farmer or the cost of capital of a  
**[0:06:17-0:06:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:06:17):**  farmer is based on their soil and based on their farming management.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:06:21):**  But, Robin O'Brien of Replant Capital did launch a $250 million  
**[0:06:26-0:06:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:06:26):**  fund focusing on that and doing just that.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:06:31):**  Food.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:06:31):**  What happens after the farm gate is as important as what happens on the farm.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:06:36):**  We need way better food companies, so more money flows to the farm and to the  
**[0:06:39-0:06:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:06:39):**  farmer who is making these transitions.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:06:42):**  We did an eight-part transition finance for farmer series with our cohost and  
**[0:06:46-0:06:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:06:46):**  partner in crime, Benedict Bozo.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:06:48):**  And we concluded that before even thinking about transition finance, we  
**[0:06:53-0:06:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:06:53):**  need better off-take agreements.  
**[0:06:54-0:06:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:06:54):**  Farmers need better long-term off-take agreements in order  
**[0:06:58-0:06:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:06:58):**  to take on transition finance.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:07:00):**  We looked at a farm to bottle soy sauce company where the farmer is actually  
**[0:07:03-0:07:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:07:03):**  part of the company and we even had a biodynamic baby food company on the show.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:07:11):**  Early days.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:07:11):**  We feel extremely fortunate to speak to so many of the pioneers, like the queen  
**[0:07:15-0:07:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:07:15):**  of Regenecke, Elaine Ingham, but it also feels like we're in a bubble and  
**[0:07:18-0:07:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:07:18):**  we're very, very early on the journey.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:07:21):**  This makes it very exciting because so many things of this new movement,  
**[0:07:25-0:07:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:07:25):**  industry, whatever we want to call it, have to be invented, like the robots of  
**[0:07:29-0:07:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:07:29):**  Clint, the virtual fences of Frank, which we had on the show, which could both end  
**[0:07:33-0:07:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:07:33):**  up revolutionizing the industry as we know it today and Greg Schumacher showed  
**[0:07:37-0:07:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:07:37):**  us again that we have no idea what's in our food today and why it's so difficult  
**[0:07:42-0:07:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:07:42):**  to measure that.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:07:43):**  But don't underestimate the decade long journey that we have ahead of us, which  
**[0:07:47-0:07:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:07:47):**  brings us to the lesson that we had before focus, focus, focus.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:07:51):**  This is the final lesson.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:07:52):**  And if you haven't been following us for a while, this may sound familiar because  
**[0:07:56-0:07:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:07:56):**  we had it as a lesson before in 2019.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:08:00):**  I'm very, very excited for another fascinating year and actually many  
**[0:08:04-0:08:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:08:04):**  fascinating years where we try to go deeper into the themes that are most  
**[0:08:08-0:08:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:08:08):**  impactful to us.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:08:08):**  If you want to know how we selected these, definitely check out our  
**[0:08:12-0:08:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:08:12):**  website, definitely find the links below because we have a full framework of how  
**[0:08:16-0:08:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:08:16):**  we selected health, which means nutrient density and food and the connection  
**[0:08:19-0:08:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:08:19):**  between healthy soil, healthy produce, healthy gut system, healthy people.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:08:24):**  Technology, what is the technology needed to scale regenerative agriculture to a  
**[0:08:28-0:08:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:08:28):**  watershed ecosystem or landscape level?  
**[0:08:31-0:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:08:31):**  Payment system for farmers, how do we pay farmers for ecosystem services?  
**[0:08:34-0:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:08:34):**  Although nobody likes that word.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:08:36):**  And transition finance, how do we finance this all?  
**[0:08:40-0:08:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:08:40):**  We hope honestly that 2021 will be a boring as in uneventful year where we  
**[0:08:44-0:08:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:08:44):**  start to focus on the growth of the regenerative agriculture sector and start  
**[0:08:47-0:08:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:08:47):**  to build the key pieces for the rest of this decade to capture this amazing  
**[0:08:51-0:08:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:08:51):**  momentum that has been happening.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:08:53):**  We're very much looking forward to next year.  
**[0:08:55-0:08:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:08:55):**  We'll be exploring the tech side of landscape scale, regeneration, hopefully  
**[0:08:58-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:08:58):**  dive deeper into regenerative aquaculture and so much more.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:09:02):**  And I wish you a very joyful holiday season looking forward to regenerating  
**[0:09:07-0:09:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:09:07):**  so much more soils and many more hectares in 2021.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:09:09):**  And many things for listening, watching, sharing, and participating.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:09:13):**  And actually a small bonus lesson.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:09:15):**  Pay what you think is worth is actually working.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:09:18):**  To help you to invest in regenerative agriculture and food, to help you ask  
**[0:09:23-0:09:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:09:23):**  the right questions, to see the right trends, we launched a video course in  
**[0:09:27-0:09:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:09:27):**  August, 2020, and the participants can pay what they think is worth to them.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:09:31):**  And many did.  
**[0:09:32-0:09:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:09:32):**  If you're one of them, thank you.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:09:34):**  You make this work possible.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:09:35):**  If you haven't checked it out yet, you can learn how to become rich quickly.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:09:38):**  By investing in regen food and egg.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:09:40):**  No, no, I'm just kidding.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:09:41):**  Investing in regen food and egg isn't easy.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:09:43):**  So don't expect and never fall for any get rich quick schemes.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:09:47):**  This is all for the lessons of 2020.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:09:50):**  I hope you have a great holiday season and looking forward to see you next year.  
**[0:09:54-0:09:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:09:54):**  Bye bye.  
**[0:09:55-0:09:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:09:55):**  Dear friends of the podcast.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:09:57):**  I'm super excited to share with you the online video course, investing in  
**[0:10:01-0:10:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:10:01):**  regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating soils  
**[0:10:05-0:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:10:05):**  at scale and growing a lot of tasty food.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:10:07):**  While doing it.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:10:08):**  Why are we doing this course after a hundred interviews and more than a  
**[0:10:12-0:10:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:10:12):**  hundred hours of audio asking the question, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[0:10:15-0:10:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:10:15):**  soils, and I've been following the space since 2011 and recording these podcasts.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:10:20):**  Since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:10:24):**  What have we seen in this space over the last years?  
**[0:10:26-0:10:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:10:26):**  How have we built our decision-making framework?  
**[0:10:29-0:10:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:10:29):**  What to focus on with the podcast?  
**[0:10:31-0:10:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:10:31):**  How have we picked interviewees and what questions should you ask?  
**[0:10:35-0:10:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:10:35):**  What is happening in this space?  
**[0:10:36-0:10:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:10:36):**  What should you read?  
**[0:10:37-0:10:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:10:37):**  What should you listen?

**[0:11:01-0:11:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:11:01):**  cetera, et cetera, people that are building soil at scale and the investors  
**[0:11:05-0:11:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:11:05):**  who are putting their own money to work through their family office or as private  
**[0:11:08-0:11:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:11:08):**  individuals or people who are putting other people's money to work through

**[0:11:16-0:11:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:11:16):**  Is this course free?  
**[0:11:18-0:11:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:11:18):**  No.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:11:18):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:11:21):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:11:25):**  And I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast, we have  
**[0:11:29-0:11:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:11:29):**  people with very different means.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:11:31):**  So I'm inviting you if this course is creating value to you and if you  
**[0:11:34-0:11:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:11:34):**  have the means to consider paying what you think it's worth, thank you.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:11:39):**  So what is this course?  
**[0:11:41-0:11:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:11:41):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes  
**[0:11:46-0:11:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:11:46):**  plus PDF slides, so you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:11:49):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and  
**[0:11:53-0:11:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:11:53):**  why extractive agriculture is so risky.  
**[0:11:55-0:11:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:11:55):**  How to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build,  
**[0:11:59-0:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:11:59):**  what to invest in and what kind of co-investors you could find or what  
**[0:12:03-0:12:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:12:03):**  kind of investors you could find if you're a soil builder, every lesson  
**[0:12:07-0:12:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:12:07):**  will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports,  
**[0:12:11-0:12:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:12:11):**  what kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:12:14):**  If you want to dig deeper, we're going to look at nutrient density,  
**[0:12:16-0:12:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/what-we-learned-in-2020#t=0:12:16):**  landscape design, and a lot more.

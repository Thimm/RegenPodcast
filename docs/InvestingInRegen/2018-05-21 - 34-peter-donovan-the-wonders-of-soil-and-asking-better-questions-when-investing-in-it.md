**[0:00:21-0:00:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:00:21):**  more.  
**[0:00:22-0:00:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:00:22):**  Enjoy.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:00:25):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:00:29-0:00:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:00:29):**  Investing as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:31-0:00:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:00:31):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:35-0:00:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:00:35):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:00:41-0:00:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:00:41):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:00:45):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:47-0:00:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:00:47):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:00:51-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:00:51):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:00:54):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:00:59-0:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:00:59):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:01:03):**  Before we get started, I've been recording these interviews next to my day job and I  
**[0:01:07-0:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:01:07):**  will definitely continue to do so and release about an episode a month.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:01:11):**  But at the same time, I would love to take this further, share more interviews.  
**[0:01:15-0:01:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:01:15):**  There are many more stories to share on investing in regenerative food and agriculture.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:01:20):**  More depth, improve the quality, maybe even doing some video series.  
**[0:01:24-0:01:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:01:24):**  So I started a Patreon community, which makes it easy to support creators like myself.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:01:29):**  If these podcasts have been of value to you and if you have the means, I invite you to  
**[0:01:33-0:01:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:01:33):**  support me and make this happen.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:01:36):**  For more information, please find the link to my Patreon account in the description below.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:01:41):**  And now without further ado, the interview.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:01:44):**  Enjoy.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:01:45):**  Welcome to investing in regenerative agriculture, investing as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:01:49):**  I'm Koon Fasein, your host.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:01:51):**  Today I'm talking to Peter Donovan.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:01:53):**  Peter has hands on experience with land and stock management, holistic management, community  
**[0:01:57-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:01:57):**  development and consensus building, and much more.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:02:00):**  He completed his holistic management educator course in 1997, but chose not to pursue certification.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:02:06):**  He lives in Eastern Oregon, USA, and Peter just published a few days ago on his website,  
**[0:02:11-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:02:11):**  recognizing the soil carbon spawns.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:02:13):**  Plus he's a good friend of Judy T. Schwartz who I interviewed last year.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:02:17):**  So we have a lot to discuss.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:02:18):**  So let's start and dive in.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:02:19):**  Welcome Peter.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:02:20):**  Thank you.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:02:21):**  To start with a personal question I always love to ask.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:02:24):**  What brings you to the space and when also because you have a long career already in  
**[0:02:28-0:02:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:02:28):**  the space and why soil and why soil carbon and sponge?  
**[0:02:32-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:02:32):**  In the 1970s I spent a lot of time herding livestock, cattle and sheep.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:02:37):**  And when I first met Alan Savory, I was very struck by his approach to decision making.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:02:47):**  And this would have been in the early 1990s.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:02:51):**  And that change, that encounter changed my life in a lot of ways.  
**[0:02:56-0:03:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:02:56):**  I went through the educator course with Alan Savory for holistic management.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:03:03):**  And what he was concentrating on then as he still does is the decision framework, looking  
**[0:03:11-0:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:03:11):**  at holes rather than trying to manage or manage parts or treat symptoms.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:03:17):**  And this seems to me very radically different from the sort of traditional decision making  
**[0:03:25-0:03:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:03:25):**  that we've probably had for thousands of years.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:03:28):**  That's either toward an objective or problem solving or in opposition to existing problem  
**[0:03:36-0:03:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:03:36):**  solving strategies.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:03:38):**  For example the environmental movement as it's currently mostly practiced is also a  
**[0:03:43-0:03:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:03:43):**  parts strategy I believe.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:03:46):**  And in my holistic management training I became extremely interested in the way the ecosystem  
**[0:03:52-0:03:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:03:52):**  functioned or how we understood that.  
**[0:03:55-0:04:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:03:55):**  And I became very interested in particularly the carbon cycle.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:04:03):**  And this was about the time that the climate issue was coming to the forefront and in the  
**[0:04:10-0:04:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:04:10):**  early 2000s.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:04:11):**  In 2007 with a friend I started the Soil Carbon Coalition which was a nonprofit and the first  
**[0:04:19-0:04:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:04:19):**  major project was figuring out how to measure change in soil carbon.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:04:25):**  And this was not as the conversation then was and perhaps still is.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:04:30):**  It's not about offsets or carbon credits but it was about to see what was possible and  
**[0:04:37-0:04:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:04:37):**  to try to connect agency, our ability to influence things, the land owners ability to influence  
**[0:04:44-0:04:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:04:44):**  things with their intention regarding the carbon cycle and in particular the value of  
**[0:04:52-0:04:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:04:52):**  soil carbon in holding water and promoting soil life and resilience and all those sorts  
**[0:04:58-0:04:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:04:58):**  of things.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:04:59):**  So my passion has been the carbon cycle which has a tremendous influence on water cycling.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:05:06):**  And a lot of people think that because our coalition has the word carbon in it we're  
**[0:05:12-0:05:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:05:12):**  about carbon offsets or carbon trading and that's not true.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:05:17):**  Carbon is a placeholder if you will for solar energy flow into biological systems.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:05:24):**  And even though the energy flow into the actual carbon cycle is pretty minuscule, less than  
**[0:05:31-0:05:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:05:31):**  a quarter watt per square meter, it has a tremendous influence on water cycling which  
**[0:05:38-0:05:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:05:38):**  is about 80 watts per square meter on average.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:05:42):**  So hundreds of times larger force but carbon cycling because it's chemical is transformational.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:05:49):**  So when you started you mentioned measurement as one of the first entry points.  
**[0:05:55-0:06:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:05:55):**  Did that mean that there wasn't too much being done in that space or it was very difficult  
**[0:06:01-0:06:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:06:01):**  for the ranchers like you or others you were working with to actually measure that?  
**[0:06:07-0:06:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:06:07):**  I think we're still in that discussion like also for the combination people but also for  
**[0:06:12-0:06:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:06:12):**  all the agriculture people that want to see that as a key point in all of their systems.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:06:18):**  Is it still difficult?  
**[0:06:19-0:06:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:06:19):**  Was it very difficult then?  
**[0:06:20-0:06:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:06:20):**  What has been your work on that?  
**[0:06:22-0:06:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:06:22):**  Well measurement of carbon is a complex, measurement of soil carbon is a complex subject because  
**[0:06:29-0:06:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:06:29):**  there's many different purposes that people bring to that.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:06:33):**  And I think it's important to distinguish those and to be aware of them.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:06:38):**  One of the purposes in the early 2000s and with the Chicago Climate Exchange for example  
**[0:06:43-0:06:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:06:43):**  in the US and my perspective is mainly North America.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:06:47):**  I should emphasize that.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:06:51):**  The perspective was we can measure carbon and then trade offsets and that's a difficult  
**[0:06:59-0:07:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:06:59):**  proposition because there's so much variability in space and time and soils for example.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:07:07):**  And early on when we started the Soil Carbon Coalition in 2007 I focused on measuring change  
**[0:07:14-0:07:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:07:14):**  over time and that is again a difficult proposition at a landscape scale but at a point scale  
**[0:07:23-0:07:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:07:23):**  it's not too bad.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:07:24):**  And most of the academic research and measurements were one time only.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:07:33):**  It's routine in institutional research to substitute space for time often because of  
**[0:07:40-0:07:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:07:40):**  the limited timeline of grant funding.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:07:43):**  So a researcher will go to Brazil for example and measure carbon in a rainforest and then  
**[0:07:52-0:07:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:07:52):**  across in the same soil type perhaps a place that was cleared 10 years ago and maybe a  
**[0:07:58-0:08:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:07:58):**  place that was cleared 40 years ago and make what is known as a chrono sequence or what  
**[0:08:05-0:08:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:08:05):**  I call a sort of a fence line comparison.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:08:08):**  And I focused very early on creating baseline sampling locations that could be accurately  
**[0:08:16-0:08:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:08:16):**  and repeatably re-measured over time.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:08:19):**  Because that's the key to repeat it and see what changed and what influence you might  
**[0:08:26-0:08:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:08:26):**  or your practices might have had if I understand correctly.  
**[0:08:31-0:08:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:08:31):**  Correct.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:08:32):**  So that can be done at a point scale but to get a statistically valid measurement of 1000  
**[0:08:39-0:08:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:08:39):**  hectares in a variable landscape is a tough one.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:08:43):**  And that's why the carbon offset conversation went from measurement to modeling pretty quickly.  
**[0:08:50-0:08:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:08:50):**  Yeah because it's extremely difficult to prove that and to keep it there.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:08:57):**  And if we then, so you're starting to measure, if we move to management, I mean I've discussed  
**[0:09:02-0:09:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:09:02):**  soil carbon many many times in this podcast but still I think for many it's relatively  
**[0:09:07-0:09:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:09:07):**  new the fact that soil actually holds carbon.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:09:10):**  Could you give a very brief but clear introduction to the ones that are thinking soil and carbon?  
**[0:09:17-0:09:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:09:17):**  That's a new concept.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:09:18):**  How that works and why it's so important the connection with water and not necessarily  
**[0:09:24-0:09:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:09:24):**  the compensation discussion that many are having at the moment?  
**[0:09:28-0:09:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:09:28):**  Well as Selman Waksman, the microbiologist who won the Nobel Prize for discovering Streptomycin  
**[0:09:35-0:09:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:09:35):**  in 1952, he wrote a book called Humus in 1936.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:09:39):**  So this is not exactly new information.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:09:42):**  He said that humus and a lot of people, that's a high carbon bunch of compounds, is the principal  
**[0:09:51-0:09:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:09:51):**  powerhouse of solar energy on the surface of the earth.  
**[0:09:56-0:10:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:09:56):**  And I define soil carbon pretty loosely as the living, the dead, and the very dead.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:10:04):**  And living organisms, biomass, tissue, is generally around half carbon by dry weight  
**[0:10:14-0:10:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:10:14):**  and carbon compounds are all of our carbohydrates, our proteins, everything that makes up a lot  
**[0:10:21-0:10:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:10:21):**  of living creatures has a tremendous fraction of carbon in it.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:10:27):**  It's one of the key molecules because of its, key atoms because of its ability to bond in  
**[0:10:34-0:10:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:10:34):**  lots of different ways and to create.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:10:36):**  It's the skeleton of, the chemical skeleton if you will, of life.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:10:41):**  Of life as we know it.  
**[0:10:43-0:10:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:10:43):**  Yeah and the mineral particles of soil, sand, silt, and clay can be bound together with  
**[0:10:52-0:11:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:10:52):**  sticky glues and cements and these are high carbon molecules usually.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:11:00):**  And all kingdoms of life produce sticky slimes and glues and plants exude sugars, carbohydrates  
**[0:11:08-0:11:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:11:08):**  through their roots and various microbes take up this food and process it into incredible  
**[0:11:17-0:11:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:11:17):**  number of compounds and some of them are sticky slimes and films that stick together these  
**[0:11:22-0:11:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:11:22):**  mineral particles.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:11:24):**  And that creates pore space, a porous matrix if you will, that in turn provides enormous  
**[0:11:32-0:11:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:11:32):**  habitats for very tiny microbes and bacteria and fungi, provides extraordinary ability  
**[0:11:40-0:11:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:11:40):**  for plant roots to penetrate and it increases nutrient availability when you have a porous  
**[0:11:47-0:11:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:11:47):**  soil and it allows for oxygen, carbon dioxide, the various soil gases to exist and in other  
**[0:11:57-0:12:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:11:57):**  words it's a living environment.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:12:01):**  The plants photosynthesizing create living soil and without that pore structure, without  
**[0:12:11-0:12:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:12:11):**  those slimes and glues that hold the soil aggregates together, our water cycling would  
**[0:12:18-0:12:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:12:18):**  wash whatever soils we had into the bottom of the sea in a blink of geologic time.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:12:25):**  Which is what's happening now, right?  
**[0:12:27-0:12:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:12:27):**  With every flood, you see this dark water basically flushing soil away.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:12:33):**  Well yes, but soil is also continuously being formed by plants and microbes and Hutton discovered  
**[0:12:43-0:12:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:12:43):**  this in the late 1700s.  
**[0:12:45-0:12:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:12:45):**  He said that both soil and rocks are part of a cycle, they're continually being destroyed  
**[0:12:51-0:12:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:12:51):**  and continually being created and of course the differential rates are pretty important  
**[0:12:56-0:13:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:12:56):**  for human civilization because the porous soil aggregate, water holding, fertility enhancing  
**[0:13:03-0:13:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:13:03):**  is the fundamental infrastructure that protects our infrastructure of steel, asphalt and concrete,  
**[0:13:14-0:13:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:13:14):**  our economies, our civilizations without the soil aggregate we're totally lost.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:13:20):**  We can't feed ourselves, we can't protect ourselves.  
**[0:13:25-0:13:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:13:25):**  And what's the current state of the soil?  
**[0:13:29-0:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:13:29):**  Very broadly, let's look at US, sorry, let's focus a little bit more.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:13:32):**  What would you say, are we in deep problems or is there a way out or are we okay in terms  
**[0:13:39-0:13:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:13:39):**  of soil management?  
**[0:13:40-0:13:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:13:40):**  Well I think there are deep problems, there's also a lot of opportunity.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:13:46):**  This is a troublesome area to report data and numbers because much depends on your methods  
**[0:13:56-0:14:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:13:56):**  and measurement and not all soils are being measured of course and the estimates of soil  
**[0:14:04-0:14:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:14:04):**  loss are pretty high for the US especially our Midwest and some other areas.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:14:13):**  And I do think there's ways out but I think the important focus is to, if we can figure  
**[0:14:20-0:14:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:14:20):**  out a way to shift from managing against what we don't want to taking the opportunity of  
**[0:14:28-0:14:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:14:28):**  managing for what we need and that's deep water holding topsoil.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:14:35):**  And what would be an example on what you've seen and how to get there?  
**[0:14:43-0:14:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:14:43):**  What is one of those opportunities to create this rich, full of life soil that can hold  
**[0:14:51-0:14:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:14:51):**  so much more water than the neighboring soil that's flushing away?  
**[0:14:56-0:15:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:14:56):**  I've measured several cases of very rapid soil carbon gain on grazing lands, on pastures  
**[0:15:08-0:15:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:15:08):**  that are being well managed with planned holistic grazing I would say.  
**[0:15:14-0:15:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:15:14):**  In other words, fairly high stock density for a limited time and good recovery periods  
**[0:15:21-0:15:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:15:21):**  for the plants and the grasses that grow there and these are perennial systems, they're not  
**[0:15:25-0:15:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:15:25):**  annual systems.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:15:29):**  I've not been able to record as high a gain in annual systems such as cropland or grasses  
**[0:15:36-0:15:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:15:36):**  but I haven't done a lot of work in annual systems.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:15:43):**  There are quite a few other reports of change in perennial systems and some annual systems  
**[0:15:53-0:15:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:15:53):**  and I think the potential is good.  
**[0:15:57-0:16:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:15:57):**  The practices probably vary quite a bit and how they're applied.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:16:04):**  I would love for people to get away from the idea that practices can be clearly defined  
**[0:16:10-0:16:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:16:10):**  and categorized because I don't believe they can and that's one of the reasons we have  
**[0:16:19-0:16:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:16:19):**  tended to focus on results even with things like infiltration or soil carbon rather than  
**[0:16:26-0:16:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:16:26):**  practices because as it turns out everybody does them differently and to get a definition  
**[0:16:36-0:16:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:16:36):**  of no till for example is pretty difficult that applies to a broad enough sector.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:16:44):**  So you're looking more at measuring infiltration rates and soil carbon as a set regardless  
**[0:16:52-0:16:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:16:52):**  of the management so you can actually compare them because it's very difficult to find 10  
**[0:16:57-0:17:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:16:57):**  or 20 farmers that are doing exactly the same system in different places.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:17:03):**  Exactly and the measurements I do are by invitation and they're pretty much always by people who  
**[0:17:10-0:17:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:17:10):**  intend to increase their soil health and productivity and so it's not a random sample if you will.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:17:21):**  It's about possibility and intent and people who think they have the agency, the ability  
**[0:17:26-0:17:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:17:26):**  to influence that and obviously take some courage too because this is a space when failure  
**[0:17:34-0:17:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:17:34):**  is possible.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:17:35):**  You can say well I intend to increase soil carbon and I fail or at least I did during  
**[0:17:43-0:17:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:17:43):**  this particular time period.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:17:46):**  Or it didn't come out as I hoped or expected or seen at other places etc.  
**[0:17:53-0:17:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:17:53):**  Exactly.  
**[0:17:54-0:17:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:17:54):**  So going from measurement what are you working on right now?  
**[0:17:59-0:18:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:17:59):**  What is the main focus of your current work?  
**[0:18:05-0:18:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:18:05):**  Well I've had to retire somewhat from the direct measurement because of need to care  
**[0:18:09-0:18:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:18:09):**  for some family members but I'm working right now on and I have been for the last couple  
**[0:18:19-0:18:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:18:19):**  of years on platforms and systems that will enable more people to participate in measuring  
**[0:18:28-0:18:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:18:28):**  and mapping what I call the most powerful planetary force which is the carbon cycle  
**[0:18:33-0:18:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:18:33):**  the circle of life and its intersection with the water cycle.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:18:38):**  And we have a web app now that's about to we're about to start using it a lot more.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:18:46):**  I've used it a lot.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:18:48):**  It's a web app called Atlas of Biological Work or AtlasBioWork.com for short and still  
**[0:18:57-0:19:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:18:57):**  working on it but it works fairly well for data entry right now and it's a very flexible  
**[0:19:03-0:19:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:19:03):**  system unlike a lot of institutional research which is always an insider game.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:19:09):**  It tends to have highly structured data and even data that's not visible or transparent  
**[0:19:18-0:19:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:19:18):**  or open.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:19:21):**  And so the design here is quite different because we're wanting to be more participatory.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:19:28):**  I can't cover the whole world by myself obviously and so the focus here is making it possible  
**[0:19:39-0:19:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:19:39):**  for others to recognize the power and the possibility of the circle of life of the soil  
**[0:19:48-0:19:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:19:48):**  carbon sponge and in general institutional research is not doing this.  
**[0:19:53-0:19:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:19:53):**  Consultants are not doing this.  
**[0:19:55-0:19:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:19:55):**  Agencies are not doing this.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:19:58):**  And I think if we're going to learn as landowners, as conservation districts, as a society how  
**[0:20:04-0:20:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:20:04):**  to manage carbon and water cycling we need feedback.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:20:11):**  Yeah it all starts with measurements.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:20:15):**  These are very complex systems.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:20:18):**  I'm not pretending that the soil carbon is the only thing that you should measure or  
**[0:20:22-0:20:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:20:22):**  the best thing that you should measure.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:20:24):**  I've been to quite a few meetings where that's been the objective or the agenda.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:20:30):**  What's the best kind of measurement to take and my answer is usually something like the  
**[0:20:35-0:20:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:20:35):**  best kind is one that's repeated and that reflects somehow on function.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:20:43):**  And repeatability I think has four, at least four ingredients.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:20:47):**  You need to be very careful about location.  
**[0:20:49-0:20:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:20:49):**  You need to have practical and affordable methods and tools.  
**[0:20:53-0:21:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:20:53):**  You need to have open data and you need to have people able and willing to make the observations  
**[0:21:00-0:21:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:21:00):**  and to record the data in an open and transparent way.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:21:05):**  And those characteristics have guided the design of the platforms we're working on and  
**[0:21:13-0:21:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:21:13):**  those also include some learning materials, inquiry based.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:21:19):**  And I might describe again the thrust of this work as I think we can ask better questions  
**[0:21:29-0:21:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:21:29):**  and I also think we can enlist or engage more people in asking and in answering those questions.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:21:38):**  It cannot be just an insider game.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:21:40):**  We need as a society, as landowners, as conservation districts, as governments, municipal, local,  
**[0:21:47-0:21:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:21:47):**  national, we need to understand what we're dealing with in terms of the circle of life.  
**[0:21:54-0:22:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:21:54):**  We need to recognize it, not just species, not just practices, not just problems, but  
**[0:22:00-0:22:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:22:00):**  the opportunity of working with the most powerful planetary force.  
**[0:22:04-0:22:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:22:04):**  And what would be a bad question or let's say a question that can be improved around  
**[0:22:11-0:22:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:22:11):**  let's say a perennial system or a landowner that would like to switch to that.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:22:17):**  What would be a bad question?  
**[0:22:18-0:22:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:22:18):**  What would be a good question?  
**[0:22:20-0:22:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:22:20):**  To give an example.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:22:21):**  Well, I can give several examples.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:22:24):**  A good question would be how can I regenerate my soils?  
**[0:22:31-0:22:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:22:31):**  A bad question would be, or an easier question, let's put it this way, would be what practices  
**[0:22:39-0:22:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:22:39):**  are usually associated with regenerating soils in my area and which of them appeal to me?  
**[0:22:46-0:22:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:22:46):**  Or what species should I plant?  
**[0:22:50-0:23:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:22:50):**  Or a good question would be how might I increase profitability and resilience on this hundred  
**[0:23:02-0:23:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:23:02):**  acres of my farm?  
**[0:23:06-0:23:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:23:06):**  A bad question might be, an easier question, how much nitrogen fertilizer should I order?  
**[0:23:13-0:23:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:23:13):**  Or what species should I plant?  
**[0:23:16-0:23:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:23:16):**  Which sensor or drone to buy?  
**[0:23:18-0:23:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:23:18):**  Right.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:23:19):**  Or a good question might be, for example, how can we address climate change?  
**[0:23:25-0:23:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:23:25):**  What I would consider a bad or a much easier question is how can we create a market for  
**[0:23:31-0:23:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:23:31):**  carbon offsets?  
**[0:23:32-0:23:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:23:32):**  So, if we stay with that good question, it's a huge topic which we can probably fill another  
**[0:23:39-0:23:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:23:39):**  complete podcast.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:23:42):**  But reading the Carbon Sponge, what would be your advice to focus on if you would be  
**[0:23:52-0:23:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:23:52):**  speaking in a theater full of investors that are impact investors that are ready to put  
**[0:23:57-0:24:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:23:57):**  their money into soil?  
**[0:24:00-0:24:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:24:00):**  They've learned about it, they've heard about it, but they haven't done anything yet.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:24:04):**  Looking at climate change, they all recognize that's one of the big topics.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:24:08):**  Soil is a huge, really interesting thing.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:24:11):**  Where to start, where to look at, if you would be able to give them some tools to start,  
**[0:24:18-0:24:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:24:18):**  some directions?  
**[0:24:20-0:24:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:24:20):**  Well for investors, I think there's a lot of ideas that you should use the latest, greatest  
**[0:24:28-0:24:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:24:28):**  regenerative practices, for example.  
**[0:24:31-0:24:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:24:31):**  But I would start somewhat earlier and the first thing would be land tenure and commitment.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:24:43):**  In other words, I don't think you can apply regenerative agriculture, whatever that exactly  
**[0:24:50-0:24:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:24:50):**  might mean, programmatically.  
**[0:24:56-0:25:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:24:56):**  What would that mean, programmatically?  
**[0:25:00-0:25:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:25:00):**  We're going to do it on 3,000 acres and we're going to do it in these steps.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:25:06):**  And these are prepackaged tools or applications or management and we're just going to apply  
**[0:25:17-0:25:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:25:17):**  them.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:25:20):**  I don't think you can manage land well that way, but that's the way people who are farming  
**[0:25:25-0:25:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:25:25):**  sometimes 30,000 or 40,000 acres do, they have a recipe.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:25:30):**  And I don't think that programmatic type of approach is, I think it's a contradiction  
**[0:25:34-0:25:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:25:34):**  in terms almost.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:25:39):**  We're really talking about something beyond practices and as an analogy, think of trying  
**[0:25:46-0:25:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:25:46):**  to create a social program that would make people more creative, responsible and behave  
**[0:25:54-0:25:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:25:54):**  with greater integrity.  
**[0:25:55-0:26:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:25:55):**  I think that's pretty much analogous to what we're trying to do when we talk about scaling  
**[0:26:01-0:26:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:26:01):**  up regenerative agriculture or increasing the pace of it or something like that.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:26:10):**  And those kinds of programs, I think, can quickly turn wrong and unprofitable.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:26:16):**  I think the key part for investment is to look at tenure and commitment, look at organic  
**[0:26:24-0:26:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:26:24):**  growth and by that I mean not necessarily certified organic, but how can you learn to  
**[0:26:32-0:26:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:26:32):**  do what you need to do as you go along and plan for succession.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:26:41):**  This is a long, long horizon kind of business.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:26:47):**  And then after all those things have been looked at, then look at the latest, greatest  
**[0:26:55-0:26:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:26:55):**  regenerative practices.  
**[0:26:57-0:27:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:26:57):**  But they're not the first thing.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:27:00):**  You need to get the conditions right first.  
**[0:27:04-0:27:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:27:04):**  Yes.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:27:06):**  Because what are your enabling conditions?  
**[0:27:10-0:27:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:27:10):**  I've seen people plunge into, we want to do the latest, greatest practices, but there  
**[0:27:16-0:27:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:27:16):**  isn't the support for that, there isn't the organic growth, there isn't the tenure, there  
**[0:27:20-0:27:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:27:20):**  isn't the commitment.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:27:22):**  And I don't think you can necessarily do this with a one or two year lease.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:27:28):**  Do you see that as one of the main issues as well, the focus on short term, either because  
**[0:27:35-0:27:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:27:35):**  of the leases or because of the cash flows, but the focus on short term and by definition  
**[0:27:40-0:27:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:27:40):**  building living systems, in this case soil and water cycles, is a long term game.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:27:45):**  So does it still clash almost by definition?  
**[0:27:49-0:27:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:27:49):**  Yes, I think that's right.  
**[0:27:51-0:27:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:27:51):**  And it's a long term gain and if you need a higher return on investment or you're not  
**[0:27:59-0:28:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:27:59):**  very patient as an investor, these are of course issues.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:28:03):**  Yeah, don't even start.  
**[0:28:05-0:28:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:28:05):**  And I would also point out, maybe this doesn't come under your definition of investment,  
**[0:28:09-0:28:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:28:09):**  but people think a lot about policy and we talk a lot about policy and climate policy  
**[0:28:18-0:28:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:28:18):**  and certifications and those kinds of things, but I think the low hanging fruit in policy  
**[0:28:25-0:28:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:28:25):**  work is perhaps to remove the barriers and disincentives, which are pretty strong in  
**[0:28:33-0:28:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:28:33):**  a lot of places.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:28:36):**  And in some cases I think this can be done with the right kind of easements or conservation  
**[0:28:40-0:28:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:28:40):**  easements, but you have to be careful there because if the future of agriculture means  
**[0:28:45-0:28:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:28:45):**  more people on the land, which I believe it does, prohibiting subdivisions or housing  
**[0:28:52-0:28:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:28:52):**  might be counterproductive over the long term.  
**[0:28:58-0:29:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:28:58):**  But we have a lot of government programs, a lot of market pressures and a lot of social  
**[0:29:02-0:29:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:29:02):**  pressures that are disincentives to the kind of agriculture that I think we'd like to see  
**[0:29:09-0:29:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:29:09):**  more of.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:29:10):**  And for example, local governments, there's a potential for doing the kinds of things  
**[0:29:20-0:29:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:29:20):**  that Charlottesville, Virginia implemented some years ago where they assessed storm sewer  
**[0:29:28-0:29:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:29:28):**  fees based upon your square footage of impervious surfaces on your property in the city of Charlottesville.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:29:36):**  And there's a combination of things that make this work.  
**[0:29:44-0:29:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:29:44):**  One is that there's not a long distance between the city who's also building or upgrading  
**[0:29:53-0:29:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:29:53):**  the storm sewer infrastructure and its property owners, its landholders.  
**[0:29:59-0:30:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:29:59):**  In other words, it's not like a carbon trade where you have the signing ceremony in the  
**[0:30:04-0:30:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:30:04):**  Hague for some farmers in Kenya.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:30:10):**  It's a close relationship and the technology is pretty good for measuring impervious surfaces  
**[0:30:18-0:30:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:30:18):**  with aerial photography.  
**[0:30:21-0:30:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:30:21):**  And there's flexibility, you can get an allotment or an allowance for replacing an asphalt driveway  
**[0:30:26-0:30:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:30:26):**  with porous paving stones, for example.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:30:30):**  There's not a lot of sensitivity to the variation in the infiltration rates of various lawns  
**[0:30:36-0:30:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:30:36):**  or landscaping.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:30:37):**  But anyway, the idea I think is sound, that you have this close relationship.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:30:44):**  The benefits are in fact measurable and that's simply not the case with so much of our atmospheric  
**[0:30:54-0:30:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:30:54):**  CO2 fixation.  
**[0:30:55-0:31:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:30:55):**  For example, carbon credits, there's no measurable benefit to the atmosphere when we increase  
**[0:31:02-0:31:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:31:02):**  solar carbon.  
**[0:31:04-0:31:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:31:04):**  And so that becomes a kind of a fantasy if you're trying to sell climate change reversal,  
**[0:31:10-0:31:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:31:10):**  for example.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:31:11):**  Does that mean that the thing we should be focusing on is water as it is much more easy  
**[0:31:20-0:31:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:31:20):**  to measure, in this case runoff or sewage runoffs.  
**[0:31:22-0:31:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:31:22):**  But of course there are many other ways that soil carbon helps the soil but also helps  
**[0:31:29-0:31:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:31:29):**  the water cycle.  
**[0:31:30-0:31:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:31:30):**  Is that something that would be an easier entry point, do you think?  
**[0:31:35-0:31:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:31:35):**  I think so.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:31:36):**  But it could be a combination of things.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:31:39):**  And I think energy, transpiration, water are intrinsically better metrics than just soil  
**[0:31:51-0:31:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:31:51):**  carbon.  
**[0:31:54-0:31:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:31:54):**  We started measuring soil carbon because in a sense it's easier to measure than measuring  
**[0:31:59-0:32:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:31:59):**  soil water because it doesn't vary quite as much over time.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:32:04):**  And it doesn't depend on the pressure, if you will, the kilopascals of pressure that  
**[0:32:11-0:32:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:32:11):**  you measure soil water with.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:32:17):**  But water can be complex but I think it's an inherently good thing to try to focus metrics  
**[0:32:25-0:32:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:32:25):**  on because the benefits are local.  
**[0:32:29-0:32:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:32:29):**  The benefits can be measured.  
**[0:32:33-0:32:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:32:33):**  One of the big costs of soil degradation is the externalized costs.  
**[0:32:41-0:32:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:32:41):**  For example, if a farmer is plowing his fields up and down hill and has tremendous amounts  
**[0:32:48-0:32:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:32:48):**  of erosion in heavy rains, some of the costs of that are typically borne by the local government  
**[0:32:55-0:33:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:32:55):**  cleaning out ditches, repairing culverts, all those kinds of things and water treatment.  
**[0:33:02-0:33:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:33:02):**  There's lots of ways those costs are externalized.  
**[0:33:07-0:33:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:33:07):**  And I think that's an incentive for continued erosion, if you will, and crop insurance subsidies  
**[0:33:15-0:33:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:33:15):**  are in that same category.  
**[0:33:16-0:33:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:33:16):**  We subsidize destruction of soil and those policies could be presumably revoked.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:33:27):**  It might be easier because they're local.  
**[0:33:30-0:33:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:33:30):**  Yes, and local governments can be more innovative by nature than large governments.  
**[0:33:40-0:34:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:33:40):**  Distance is a huge factor everywhere but also there.  
**[0:34:09-0:34:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:34:09):**  What would be one or two things to watch out for or one or two things to look into further?  
**[0:34:20-0:34:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:34:20):**  I would go back to my short list, tenure and commitment, an organic growth and succession  
**[0:34:26-0:34:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:34:26):**  of management and then the soil health principles and the latest, greatest regenerative practices.  
**[0:34:34-0:34:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:34:34):**  That would be, again, my advice to impact investors and it's not a simple step, I guess,  
**[0:34:42-0:34:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:34:42):**  but to know the landowners and the land managers that you may be working with.  
**[0:34:48-0:34:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:34:48):**  Or if you're buying land, you must be prepared at some level to manage all of these things.  
**[0:34:54-0:34:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:34:54):**  Yeah, definitely requires a commitment.  
**[0:34:58-0:34:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:34:58):**  Yes.  
**[0:34:59-0:35:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:34:59):**  And that, by definition, is long term.  
**[0:35:01-0:35:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:35:01):**  And what will you be working on allowing, obviously, for family matters?  
**[0:35:06-0:35:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:35:06):**  Let's say this year, what will be your main focus?  
**[0:35:11-0:35:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:35:11):**  Well, we're about to start working more on some remote sensing stuff.  
**[0:35:20-0:35:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:35:20):**  Length of green season, I think, is a critical metric that can be measured approximately  
**[0:35:29-0:35:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:35:29):**  with satellite observations that are now free.  
**[0:35:32-0:35:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:35:32):**  So that's what I consider sort of a low hanging fruit.  
**[0:35:36-0:35:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:35:36):**  And so what does that mean?  
**[0:35:39-0:35:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:35:39):**  Length of green season is the amount of time that you have green growing plants that in  
**[0:35:45-0:35:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:35:45):**  turn are feeding the soil microbes and have the potential to be building or growing soil.  
**[0:35:56-0:36:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:35:56):**  And I think one of the issues or the reasons that so much agriculture has been degrading  
**[0:36:05-0:36:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:36:05):**  soil is that it focuses on short season annual crops, often with nothing growing in between.  
**[0:36:12-0:36:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:36:12):**  So that you have either plowed bare soil or blowing dust or not much photosynthesis happening  
**[0:36:19-0:36:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:36:19):**  before the crop is planted and after it is harvested.  
**[0:36:23-0:36:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:36:23):**  So that's not a good situation for mycorrhizal fungi, for example.  
**[0:36:29-0:36:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:36:29):**  They depend on plants for their life and for their ability to scavenge phosphorus and build  
**[0:36:41-0:36:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:36:41):**  soil structure.  
**[0:36:42-0:36:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:36:42):**  But the length of green season is, so it's a critical thing and it can be measured with  
**[0:36:50-0:36:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:36:50):**  remote sensing satellites.  
**[0:36:52-0:37:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:36:52):**  Is that what they've used in that paper, I'm blanking if it's in Montana or Iowa, to measure  
**[0:37:02-0:37:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:37:02):**  if not letting the land bare basically affected the local climate?  
**[0:37:10-0:37:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:37:10):**  Right.  
**[0:37:11-0:37:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:37:11):**  And that paper referenced some other studies, but according to some of the information that  
**[0:37:15-0:37:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:37:15):**  came out of there, and I'm not exactly sure of the geography, but in the northern Great  
**[0:37:19-0:37:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:37:19):**  Plains, the acreage of summer fallow, in other words, bare ground for the entire growing  
**[0:37:24-0:37:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:37:24):**  season in the hopes of storing enough moisture to raise a crop the following year, the acreage  
**[0:37:31-0:37:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:37:31):**  of summer fallow decreased from 77 million acres to about 20 million, mainly from 1985  
**[0:37:38-0:37:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:37:38):**  to the present when the basically no till became more widely practiced, in other words,  
**[0:37:44-0:37:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:37:44):**  direct seeding rather than plowing up everything to prepare a seed bed.  
**[0:37:50-0:38:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:37:50):**  So and in combination with an increase in summer cover, there's been a big change in  
**[0:38:00-0:38:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:38:00):**  the northern Midwest, you know, I'm talking about western South Dakota, a lot of eastern  
**[0:38:04-0:38:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:38:04):**  Montana, in the switching from a growing a crop of wheat every other year, for example,  
**[0:38:14-0:38:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:38:14):**  to growing crops continuous every year without disturbing the soil with deep plowing, in  
**[0:38:23-0:38:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:38:23):**  other words, minimizing tillage.  
**[0:38:26-0:38:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:38:26):**  And that appears to have affected the amount of convective precipitation, which has a cooling  
**[0:38:33-0:38:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:38:33):**  effect and also is reflected in temperatures.  
**[0:38:38-0:38:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:38:38):**  So the no-till movement, as far as we see the first data, and we have to be very careful  
**[0:38:45-0:38:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:38:45):**  there obviously, had actually an effect on, of course, local temperature as on the land  
**[0:38:51-0:38:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:38:51):**  because bare land compared to something growing on it is a huge difference.  
**[0:38:55-0:39:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:38:55):**  But actually, if you look at the full, in this case watershed or ecosystem, it had an  
**[0:39:00-0:39:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:39:00):**  effect on much more than that.  
**[0:39:04-0:39:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:39:04):**  Yes.  
**[0:39:05-0:39:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:39:05):**  And similar reports have been coming out of other places where there's a lot of summer  
**[0:39:10-0:39:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:39:10):**  fallow in Oklahoma, meteorologists have noticed a heating and drying effect.  
**[0:39:16-0:39:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:39:16):**  That's huge news, or am I overestimating this?  
**[0:39:20-0:39:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:39:20):**  I mean, we've known it, but now we can see it.  
**[0:39:24-0:39:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:39:24):**  Yeah, and it's, people have been reporting these for actually centuries, but we have  
**[0:39:29-0:39:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:39:29):**  so many filters on what we know and what we allow into our heads.  
**[0:39:36-0:39:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:39:36):**  And we have so many incentives, you know, vested interests, specialized knowledge that  
**[0:39:42-0:39:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:39:42):**  keep these things from coming in.  
**[0:39:44-0:39:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:39:44):**  So I think it's very hard for us to see the opportunities in this sometimes.  
**[0:39:49-0:39:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:39:49):**  But now with free satellite data, you maybe be able to see it in more places, is that  
**[0:39:58-0:40:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:39:58):**  what you're thinking?  
**[0:40:00-0:40:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:40:00):**  Yes, I think the length of green season is a better question than, you know, how many  
**[0:40:06-0:40:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:40:06):**  weeds do we have or something like that.  
**[0:40:10-0:40:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:40:10):**  And how is it maybe changing over time, including large areas.  
**[0:40:17-0:40:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:40:17):**  Now the satellite data we have is increasing in quality, it doesn't go all that far back.  
**[0:40:25-0:40:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:40:25):**  And so going forward, I think we'll have some very good data on change.  
**[0:40:31-0:40:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:40:31):**  And I think that's important for landowners, conservation districts, local governments  
**[0:40:37-0:40:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:40:37):**  to see what's possible.  
**[0:40:40-0:40:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:40:40):**  And therefore to take responsibility.  
**[0:40:42-0:40:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:40:42):**  It's like learning a skill.  
**[0:40:44-0:40:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:40:44):**  You have to know that it's possible, that it's practical, and it's important to me,  
**[0:40:50-0:40:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:40:50):**  and you'll learn it.  
**[0:40:51-0:40:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:40:51):**  And in this case, it's possible because we see it, it's practical, and it's important  
**[0:40:55-0:41:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:40:55):**  to me because it reduces the incredible heat waves we're having and also brings a lot more  
**[0:41:01-0:41:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:41:01):**  moist to when the plants need it most.  
**[0:41:04-0:41:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:41:04):**  Yes, our yields can be better, our resilience to droughts can be much better.  
**[0:41:09-0:41:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:41:09):**  That's going to be very interesting to figure out what is, which completely depends on,  
**[0:41:15-0:41:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:41:15):**  as I'm asking this question, I see it completely depends on the space, on the place, but what  
**[0:41:19-0:41:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:41:19):**  is, at what scale it starts to influence and what, so what, where do you need to get and  
**[0:41:25-0:41:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:41:25):**  which places are even more, almost like acupuncture, more important to make sure they're green  
**[0:41:30-0:41:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:41:30):**  constantly compared to other places in the watershed that maybe are of less importance  
**[0:41:34-0:41:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:41:34):**  because of their, their, their location, et cetera.  
**[0:41:37-0:41:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:41:37):**  Yes.  
**[0:41:38-0:41:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:41:38):**  And that's, that's obviously local knowledge too.  
**[0:41:41-0:41:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:41:41):**  And just another example, I know of a farm in the central valley of California that in  
**[0:41:46-0:41:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:41:46):**  2015, 2016, they, they, they're raising lots of tomatoes, tomatoes every year, tomatoes,  
**[0:41:53-0:41:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:41:53):**  processing tomatoes and fresh tomatoes.  
**[0:41:56-0:42:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:41:56):**  And in the winter of 2015, 2016, they started planting a cover crop of mustard and a few  
**[0:42:02-0:42:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:42:02):**  other things in the winter, and it's a winter rainfall regime, and they got a good growth  
**[0:42:07-0:42:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:42:07):**  in the winter and their length of green season really increased and they roll this cover  
**[0:42:15-0:42:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:42:15):**  crop down before they plant their, and they plant their tomatoes right into the residue.  
**[0:42:22-0:42:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:42:22):**  And that system has basically saved them about a third of their water use, which is huge  
**[0:42:30-0:42:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:42:30):**  in the central valley of California, and it's reduced their fertilizer use by half.  
**[0:42:39-0:42:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:42:39):**  And these are both huge economic gains.  
**[0:42:42-0:42:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:42:42):**  Yeah, then the next question is to ask is how many do you need of their neighbors to,  
**[0:42:49-0:42:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:42:49):**  to start not, I wouldn't say playing with the weather because it would be bad, but to  
**[0:42:54-0:42:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:42:54):**  influence it and to bring down these peaks that, that cause so much harm?  
**[0:42:58-0:43:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:42:58):**  Yeah, I, I don't know.  
**[0:43:01-0:43:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:43:01):**  No, no, that's what we're going to find out.  
**[0:43:03-0:43:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:43:03):**  That's the interesting part.  
**[0:43:06-0:43:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:43:06):**  Yeah.  
**[0:43:07-0:43:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:43:07):**  And so I would, I guess, I guess my advice to investors is the same that I'm giving to  
**[0:43:13-0:43:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:43:13):**  everyone else is ask better questions and engage more people in answering and asking  
**[0:43:18-0:43:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:43:18):**  them.  
**[0:43:19-0:43:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:43:19):**  I think that's, that's great advice.  
**[0:43:22-0:43:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:43:22):**  I want to thank you so much for your time.  
**[0:43:24-0:43:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:43:24):**  And because we're on top of the hour as well, I would like to thank you for sharing and  
**[0:43:29-0:43:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:43:29):**  taking us a bit deeper into, into the soil water cycles and carbon cycle.  
**[0:43:35-0:43:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:43:35):**  And hopefully we'll step away from this and ask better questions.  
**[0:43:39-0:43:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:43:39):**  Okay.

**[0:44:48-0:44:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:44:48):**  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[0:44:52-0:44:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:44:52):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  
**[0:44:56-0:44:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:44:56):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[0:44:58-0:45:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:44:58):**  After 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question how to put money  
**[0:45:02-0:45:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:45:02):**  to work in regenerating soils, and I've been following the space since 2011.  
**[0:45:07-0:45:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:45:07):**  And recording this podcast since 2016.  
**[0:45:09-0:45:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:45:09):**  We thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  
**[0:45:12-0:45:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:45:12):**  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  
**[0:45:14-0:45:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:45:14):**  How have we built our decision making framework?

**[0:45:19-0:45:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:45:19):**  How have we picked interviewees?  
**[0:45:22-0:45:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:45:22):**  And what questions should you ask?

**[0:45:54-0:45:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:45:54):**  to work through their family office or as private individuals, or people who are putting  
**[0:45:58-0:46:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:45:58):**  other people's money to work through foundations, institutional capital, banks, insurance companies,

**[0:46:06-0:46:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:46:06):**  No.  
**[0:46:07-0:46:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:46:07):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:46:09-0:46:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:46:09):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.  
**[0:46:13-0:46:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:46:13):**  And I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very  
**[0:46:18-0:46:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/peter-donovan/#t=0:46:18):**  different means.

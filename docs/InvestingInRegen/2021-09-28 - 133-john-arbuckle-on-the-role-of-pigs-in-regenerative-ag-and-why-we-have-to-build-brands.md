**[0:00:12-0:00:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:00:13):**  What's the role of the humble pig in the regenerative ag movement and why is building brands key  
**[0:00:19-0:00:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:00:19):**  to get customers on board?  
**[0:00:23-0:00:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:00:23):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture investing as if the  
**[0:00:27-0:00:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:00:27):**  planet mattered.  
**[0:00:28-0:00:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:00:28):**  A podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:33-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:00:33):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:00:38-0:00:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:00:38):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:43-0:00:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:00:43):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:45-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:00:45):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:00:49-0:00:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:00:49):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:00:52-0:00:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:00:52):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:00:56-0:01:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:00:56):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:00-0:01:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:01:00):**  In March last year, we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support  
**[0:01:05-0:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:01:05):**  our work.

**[0:01:25-0:01:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:01:25):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:27-0:01:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:01:27):**  Welcome to another episode today with John, who is with his family and a network of pork  
**[0:01:31-0:01:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:01:31):**  producers are attempting to usher the humble pig into the world of regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:01:37):**  Welcome John.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:01:38):**  Hey, thank you so much for having me.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:01:40):**  I know you have a long history, a family history into farming, but that doesn't mean you had  
**[0:01:45-0:01:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:01:45):**  to end up on a farm.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:01:46):**  So how, how did you end up working on regenerative agriculture on soil?  
**[0:01:50-0:01:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:01:50):**  And then we talk about the pig part.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:01:52):**  Yeah.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:01:53):**  So how did we end up farming?  
**[0:01:55-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:01:55):**  We ended up farming because I truly and deeply love having a relationship with the earth,  
**[0:02:00-0:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:02:00):**  being able to touch the earth for a living.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:02:03):**  And there are so many stories in the world.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:02:07):**  There's so many stories about how human beings create the downward spiral of destruction.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:02:12):**  Anytime they touch a resource for economic gain, they ruin it.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:02:18):**  And I feel somewhat disturbed by that being the only narrative I would like to demonstrate  
**[0:02:23-0:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:02:23):**  through regenerative agriculture, that the opposite is very possible.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:02:27):**  We can touch the earth for a living.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:02:29):**  We can provide for our families and create economic gain for ourselves and build soil  
**[0:02:33-0:02:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:02:33):**  and healthy food.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:02:35):**  And at the same time, we can be healing ecosystems.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:02:38):**  And that's really what gets me up in the morning.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:02:41):**  That's what puts a little sparkle in my eye is thinking human beings can touch the earth  
**[0:02:45-0:02:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:02:45):**  and we can provide for ourselves and we can create a more robust and more vibrant ecosystem  
**[0:02:53-0:02:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:02:53):**  than the one that we received.  
**[0:02:55-0:02:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:02:55):**  And what do you tell the naysayers?  
**[0:02:57-0:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:02:57):**  Because that's a pretty big statement.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:02:58):**  It's the reason I'm interested in the space, but it's a pretty big statement you put there  
**[0:03:03-0:03:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:03:03):**  that we are able to economically regenerate, provide and actually heal a lot of places  
**[0:03:09-0:03:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:03:09):**  and ecosystems.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:03:10):**  And then you get like, yeah, but what about feeding the world?  
**[0:03:14-0:03:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:03:14):**  And how do you normally start a conversation like that if somebody goes into the defense  
**[0:03:20-0:03:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:03:20):**  mood and crosses his arms or her arms and what would you advise people?  
**[0:03:24-0:03:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:03:24):**  Because I think a lot of people in listening to this could help some pointers to have that  
**[0:03:30-0:03:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:03:30):**  kind of discussion with a lot of naysayers we often find.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:03:32):**  No, for sure.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:03:33):**  So I respect everyone's position and to the naysayers, I don't try to twist their arm.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:03:38):**  I just share my experience.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:03:40):**  So my experience is for starters, the opposite of the statement I'm making is that there  
**[0:03:47-0:03:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:03:47):**  is no hope.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:03:48):**  Right.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:03:49):**  And I'm making the statement there is hope.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:03:51):**  So if someone wants to argue there is no hope, then they can do that.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:03:57):**  And that's what extractive agriculture does to the human soul.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:04:00):**  Right.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:04:01):**  So in the opposite, to make the statement there is hope, I base that on daily observation.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:04:07):**  I have lived and worked on three farms, which I have either owned or worked on and started  
**[0:04:15-0:04:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:04:15):**  out watching each one as a very extremely degraded environment.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:04:21):**  You know, the last farm that I lived on back in the Midwest, it would not grow grass on  
**[0:04:26-0:04:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:04:26):**  grassy ground, you know, but after 90 days, there was still no grass in the summer.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:04:31):**  It was extremely depleted.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:04:34):**  And after, you know, we started getting involved with the Savory Institute and learning about  
**[0:04:38-0:04:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:04:38):**  rotational grazing and then that evolving into regenerative grazing, it was exploding  
**[0:04:45-0:04:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:04:45):**  with grass out of the ground.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:04:46):**  I could run so many cows and so many pigs.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:04:51):**  And then we would find all these little, I call them Easter eggs.  
**[0:04:53-0:05:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:04:53):**  You know, Easter eggs are the unexpected treasures that pop up along life's journey.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:05:01):**  And so many little Easter eggs would pop up for us.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:05:04):**  The most recent being, we have one field that when we got to this, our current farm was  
**[0:05:10-0:05:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:05:10):**  pure Canada thistle.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:05:13):**  It was, shall we estimate, 90% Canada thistle.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:05:17):**  You could not walk through it.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:05:19):**  Which just for people that what is Canada thistle, it sounds like something you don't  
**[0:05:22-0:05:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:05:22):**  want to have.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:05:23):**  You do not.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:05:24):**  It does not help very much, relatively speaking.  
**[0:05:28-0:05:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:05:28):**  Better than bare ground, but it's not grass and clover, you know.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:05:31):**  Barely, yeah.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:05:32):**  So Canada thistle is an invasive weed that is very spiny.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:05:37):**  It's just covered with, they're not exactly thorns, but they're very small needles like  
**[0:05:41-0:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:05:41):**  a miniature cactus, if you will.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:05:43):**  Vegetative cactus.  
**[0:05:45-0:05:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:05:45):**  And pigs don't enjoy walking through it.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:05:47):**  Pigs don't enjoy lying on it.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:05:49):**  You know, cows will nibble on it, but there's other things that will help them gain weight  
**[0:05:53-0:05:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:05:53):**  faster.  
**[0:05:55-0:05:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:05:55):**  And this one field was exclusively Canada thistle.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:05:58):**  It was nothing else almost, it seemed.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:06:00):**  And after a very short four rounds of pulse grazing, the Canada thistle was out competed  
**[0:06:08-0:06:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:06:08):**  by grasses, forbs, and clover.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:06:11):**  And just to have witnessed that.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:06:12):**  And that gives you hope.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:06:15):**  Very much so, because I can do that on landscape scales.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:06:18):**  What we did there did not take three human generations to achieve.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:06:23):**  It took four prescribed grazing events.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:06:26):**  And the ground just changed immediately underneath me.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:06:29):**  I had no idea it would happen so quickly.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:06:31):**  And we see, when we're actually living in relationship with the earth, we get up eager  
**[0:06:36-0:06:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:06:36):**  to make observations every day.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:06:38):**  There's no shortage of those moments.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:06:41):**  And that gives me an awfully lot of hope, because I experience it, if not on a daily  
**[0:06:45-0:06:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:06:45):**  basis, on a weekly basis.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:06:47):**  And so, why in your statement, you mentioned the humble pig into the regenerative egg movement.  
**[0:06:53-0:06:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:06:53):**  Hasn't it been there?  
**[0:06:55-0:06:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:06:55):**  And if not, why has it been ignored?  
**[0:06:57-0:06:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:06:57):**  Yeah.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:06:58):**  So, in the regenerative agriculture movement, the low-hanging fruit, and I say that respectfully,  
**[0:07:03-0:07:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:07:03):**  but the low-hanging fruit is ruminants.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:07:06):**  Animals that have a rumen and are able to live exclusively on grasses, or forbs and  
**[0:07:11-0:07:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:07:11):**  legumes.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:07:12):**  I'll just call them grasses for simplicity for right now.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:07:15):**  So we take grass-fed cattle or lamb.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:07:20):**  All of those creatures have the inner mechanisms, the inner machinery of their digestive system  
**[0:07:26-0:07:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:07:26):**  is able to break down the cell wall of grasses and extract carbohydrates from it.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:07:33):**  It's because they have a four-chambered stomach.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:07:35):**  The first chamber is called the rumen, and the rumen gives them their superpower.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:07:39):**  You know, their superpower is to do what I just explained and to extract carbohydrates  
**[0:07:44-0:07:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:07:44):**  from the cell wall.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:07:45):**  I cannot do that.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:07:47):**  I need to eat things other than the grass in my front yard, if I am to, you know, remain  
**[0:07:53-0:07:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:07:53):**  healthy.  
**[0:07:54-0:07:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:07:54):**  Survive.  
**[0:07:55-0:07:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:07:55):**  Yeah, if I am to survive.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:07:56):**  So, cows and sheep on the other hand, they can synthesize the amino acids that they require  
**[0:08:01-0:08:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:08:01):**  because of their rumen to consume pure foragers and grow and be healthy and happy.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:08:07):**  The pig is more like me.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:08:09):**  The pig has a single stomach, and because of that, it was not the easiest creature to  
**[0:08:16-0:08:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:08:16):**  bring into the world of regenerative farming.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:08:19):**  It requires grass plus something else.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:08:23):**  So the pig does eat grass, unlike you, but needs X percent, what is it, 80, I don't know  
**[0:08:28-0:08:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:08:28):**  the number, but needs a lot of other things and diversity.  
**[0:08:31-0:08:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:08:31):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:08:32):**  The word omnivore is a gradient rather than a line in the sand, and the pig is more omnivorous.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:08:41):**  Just like region egg.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:08:42):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:08:43):**  A lot of space to maneuver it.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:08:45):**  So the pig is more omnivorous than I am.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:08:48):**  The pig can consume grass and delights in consuming grasses and clovers, and it can  
**[0:08:53-0:08:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:08:53):**  get more good out of it than I can.  
**[0:08:55-0:09:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:08:55):**  But at the same time, if I want these animals to finish in a number of days, which is competitive  
**[0:09:03-0:09:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:09:03):**  with grain fed animals, because, and there's no secret, you know, we give our pigs grain,  
**[0:09:08-0:09:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:09:08):**  and pretty much everybody does, if you were to exclusively remove grain from a pig's diet,  
**[0:09:13-0:09:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:09:13):**  or if you were to remove some sort of supplemental concentrate in any form, that would basically  
**[0:09:19-0:09:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:09:19):**  just be a mean thing to do to a pig.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:09:23):**  So in order to get the pig to finish without it taking forever, and to finish at a weight  
**[0:09:29-0:09:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:09:29):**  that is economically beneficial to the farmer, we do keep grain on hand.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:09:34):**  Now on our farm, we also make use of a couple other what I kind of lovingly call unfair  
**[0:09:40-0:09:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:09:40):**  advantages, you know, I live a half a mile from a craft beer factory.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:09:47):**  And I received, you know, 36.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:09:49):**  I have a feeling where this is going.  
**[0:09:51-0:09:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:09:51):**  Yeah, happy pigs, happy pigs.  
**[0:09:54-0:10:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:09:54):**  So we received 3600 pounds of barley from the beer facility every week.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:10:00):**  And it comes in a very measured way.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:10:02):**  Every day I go get two trailer loads and then I feed it to the pigs.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:10:07):**  Because that's one of the other ways of pigs and to a certain extent chickens as well,  
**[0:10:11-0:10:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:10:11):**  they have the ability to take food waste at the end somewhere in the food value chain,  
**[0:10:17-0:10:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:10:17):**  and not necessarily of our plates, but somewhere in the brewery somewhere in the factory.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:10:21):**  And a lot of that is very edible, but not sellable.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:10:24):**  And pigs have the ability to turn it into something much more valuable as in animal  
**[0:10:29-0:10:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:10:29):**  protein.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:10:30):**  Yeah, so at present, the craft brewery that we picked the barley up from has to would  
**[0:10:35-0:10:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:10:35):**  have to pay to have it removed from their premises.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:10:39):**  Whereas I come and get it twice a day and bring back a trailer and give it to my pigs  
**[0:10:43-0:10:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:10:43):**  and, and then whatever our pigs cannot consume, if we get a denuded spot where you know, they  
**[0:10:50-0:10:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:10:50):**  got extra high impact around the water tank or something, then we'll recover the ground,  
**[0:10:56-0:11:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:10:56):**  we'll take that barley and we'll just cover the ground with it after the pigs have moved  
**[0:11:00-0:11:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:11:00):**  on.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:11:01):**  I can also say that we have a relationship with a cheese pouch down in Portland, Maine,  
**[0:11:07-0:11:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:11:07):**  and we receive a 400 pound barrel of cheddar cheese every day.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:11:12):**  So between the barley and the cheddar cheese and the grass, we are meeting a lot of our  
**[0:11:18-0:11:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:11:18):**  pigs needs.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:11:19):**  Now, we keep non GMO whole grains in a bin, because that's my responsibility to the pigs.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:11:25):**  If something were to happen to my supply of cheese and barley, then we would need some  
**[0:11:30-0:11:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:11:30):**  kind of storable feed in order to keep the growth, the rate of gain headed in the right  
**[0:11:35-0:11:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:11:35):**  direction.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:11:36):**  And so talking about this supplements or inputs, what is then the role of the pig in your landscape  
**[0:11:43-0:11:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:11:43):**  on your land or in general in an ecosystem?  
**[0:11:46-0:11:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:11:46):**  Yeah.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:11:47):**  So on a farm, a pig represents a different role than in nature.  
**[0:11:53-0:11:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:11:53):**  The reason for that is a pig in nature, you know, wild boars in California, you know,  
**[0:11:59-0:12:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:11:59):**  extremely destructive, or the wild boars in Texas, you know, extremely destructive, but  
**[0:12:04-0:12:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:12:04):**  in nature, there may be a family of wild boars, you know, on 1000 acres, let's say.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:12:11):**  So let's say that there are 15 individuals on 1000 acres.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:12:15):**  That's not exactly farming, you know, so I need to have a certain number of pigs, I'm  
**[0:12:21-0:12:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:12:21):**  raising pigs on pasture by the semi load.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:12:24):**  If I were to raise pigs on pasture, and not manage for roofing, I would be not rotationally  
**[0:12:32-0:12:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:12:32):**  grazing, I would be rotationally ruining.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:12:36):**  And every time the pigs left a paddock, it would look like a pure mudlot from World War  
**[0:12:44-0:12:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:12:44):**  One, no man's land kind of thing.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:12:46):**  The way that we manage for that, we manage for that in a couple of ways.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:12:49):**  The first is that we use a humane septum ring in the pig's nose.  
**[0:12:55-0:12:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:12:55):**  And that is applied immediately at weaning.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:12:58):**  So the pigs never actually learn to root, you know, as soon as they are weaned from  
**[0:13:03-0:13:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:13:03):**  nursing on their mother at about eight weeks, we apply a septum ring, a humane septum ring,  
**[0:13:10-0:13:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:13:10):**  and that prevents rooting.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:13:12):**  And then secondarily, we're moving the animals rotationally based on positive animal impact.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:13:20):**  So when we allow the animals back into a paddock, a temporary paddock, and of course, we're  
**[0:13:26-0:13:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:13:26):**  using movable electric fencing, the same sort of fencing that the grass fed beef world uses.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:13:31):**  We're using that but we're just adjusting it to the height of a pig.  
**[0:13:35-0:13:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:13:35):**  So once the pigs have trampled and manured a paddock uniformly, then we move them on.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:13:44):**  And the combination of those two factors is that we can guarantee that the creeks that  
**[0:13:49-0:13:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:13:49):**  drain our farm that go directly into the Atlantic Ocean, some of these creeks used to be, you  
**[0:13:55-0:13:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:13:55):**  know, remnant wild Atlantic salmon runs.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:13:58):**  And we want those creeks to be as clear and cold and as full of dissolved oxygen and to  
**[0:14:04-0:14:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:14:04):**  have no nutrient load coming off of my farm.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:14:08):**  And because of that, we can't allow commercially viable quantities of pigs that are living  
**[0:14:15-0:14:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:14:15):**  on our farm to root up and destroy a paddock like the wild boars in Texas do.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:14:22):**  And then how do you sell?  
**[0:14:24-0:14:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:14:24):**  What's the one bad day as some would call it, but what's the face after that?  
**[0:14:29-0:14:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:14:29):**  If you set up Singing Pastures, which is the farm and the company you set up, what made  
**[0:14:34-0:14:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:14:34):**  you do that?  
**[0:14:35-0:14:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:14:35):**  Because you are treating pigs very differently, very different ecosystem function.  
**[0:14:41-0:14:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:14:41):**  I'm imagining you can sell it all off the farm and triggered that into starting a company,  
**[0:14:46-0:14:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:14:46):**  starting a food brand around a very different way of farming pigs, not in-house, not a factory  
**[0:14:52-0:14:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:14:52):**  farm basically, which is I think 99.9% of all the pigs you will ever, pig meat you will  
**[0:14:58-0:14:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:14:58):**  ever eat if you're eating them.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:14:59):**  Yeah.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:15:00):**  Yeah.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:15:01):**  So, the question is, why did we start a brand?  
**[0:15:04-0:15:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:15:04):**  And to answer that, I have a slightly long answer.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:15:07):**  It was, you know, when I grew up raising pigs, we were doing everything in the most conventional  
**[0:15:12-0:15:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:15:12):**  way.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:15:13):**  You know, we had our very own small factory farm, you know, and the pigs lived in a pig  
**[0:15:19-0:15:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:15:19):**  barn over on slatted floors.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:15:21):**  And this was very common in Illinois in 1980.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:15:25):**  And I realized that when I took over the farm that I would have my freedom to be in the  
**[0:15:32-0:15:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:15:32):**  driver's seat and to make my own decisions.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:15:34):**  So, when I eventually took over our family farm back in the Midwest, for starters, it  
**[0:15:39-0:15:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:15:39):**  was in a different place.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:15:40):**  So, it gave me a certain blank canvas to paint on.  
**[0:15:44-0:15:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:15:44):**  But, you know, the first thing we did, we didn't do row crops anymore.  
**[0:15:48-0:15:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:15:48):**  You know, we stopped doing the high tillage row crops.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:15:51):**  We exchanged our pig genetics from indoor pigs to heritage breed outdoor pigs that can  
**[0:15:58-0:16:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:15:58):**  live and thrive and be happy in a wider range of temperatures and environmental conditions.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:16:04):**  And we ceased to give the animals conventional grain.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:16:07):**  We gave them non-GMO grain.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:16:08):**  We removed the antibiotics.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:16:10):**  And the last step in this enormous conversion, you know, from conventional to regenerative  
**[0:16:19-0:16:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:16:19):**  was that we thought, you know, like now that we're doing this additional labor, now that  
**[0:16:24-0:16:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:16:24):**  we're doing all of these steps to create beauty in the world, it doesn't really work to sell  
**[0:16:29-0:16:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:16:29):**  to the sale barn, you know, for me.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:16:31):**  So, we thought, well, let's do the next step in our conversion for regenerative.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:16:36):**  Let's create, you know, a brand.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:16:38):**  A brand is a force multiplier for a variety of things.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:16:43):**  And the force multiplier that we wanted was we wanted the possibility of selling our brand,  
**[0:16:48-0:16:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:16:48):**  you know, when we approach retirement age.  
**[0:16:51-0:16:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:16:51):**  And we wanted to have a little bit of additional income that comes from the management and  
**[0:16:55-0:16:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:16:55):**  marketing of a brand.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:16:57):**  So, at present, you know, we raise pork for my own snack stick company.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:17:02):**  It's Singing Pastures is the name of the company.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:17:05):**  And then our hero product, if you want to call it that, is called Rome Sticks, our OAM.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:17:11):**  So Rome Sticks are shelf stable, one ounce snack sticks that we make from the pigs that  
**[0:17:16-0:17:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:17:16):**  we raise.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:17:18):**  And we decided that that would be a better bet for our family in the long term to create  
**[0:17:24-0:17:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:17:24):**  a brand.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:17:25):**  Was that partly, I mean, I'm still understanding why the pig and not go for the, I would quote  
**[0:17:30-0:17:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:17:30):**  unquote easier route of grass fed where there is a, I wouldn't say an industry starting,  
**[0:17:34-0:17:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:17:34):**  but definitely a larger movement.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:17:37):**  Have you seen some signs around that, around the pig side as well, where it's, I haven't  
**[0:17:42-0:17:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:17:42):**  seen a lot of it around pasture raised pigs.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:17:45):**  And what have you seen in that in the last years compared to the grass fed beef space  
**[0:17:49-0:17:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:17:49):**  and the lamb space and then maybe the cheese even like that understanding the role of the  
**[0:17:53-0:17:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:17:53):**  animal in the ecosystem and understanding that most of pig farms is definitely not in  
**[0:17:58-0:18:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:17:58):**  a way we like it to be.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:18:00):**  Have you seen the same kind of, or have you seen a lot of people discovering that and  
**[0:18:05-0:18:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:18:05):**  maybe other farmers starting to switch as well, or is it, is the jump enormously high  
**[0:18:10-0:18:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:18:10):**  to go from indoor pig farming to pasture raised and what you described just now with non-GMO  
**[0:18:15-0:18:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:18:15):**  non-antibiotics, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:18:18):**  So I think I hear two questions.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:18:19):**  The first one is why didn't we make beef sticks?  
**[0:18:22-0:18:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:18:22):**  And then the second part is how do I justify pork into the world, especially when pork  
**[0:18:27-0:18:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:18:27):**  is quite commonly a very destructive protein.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:18:31):**  Am I correct?  
**[0:18:32-0:18:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:18:32):**  Am I hearing you right?  
**[0:18:33-0:18:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:18:33):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:18:34-0:18:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:18:34):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:18:35):**  And probably a few others.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:18:36):**  It was a very long question.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:18:37):**  Yeah, sure.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:18:38):**  No, that's fine.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:18:39):**  That's fine.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:18:40):**  So why not beef?  
**[0:18:41-0:18:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:18:41):**  That's a two part answer for me.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:18:42):**  The first part was the beef sticks.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:18:46):**  There's a million beef sticks in the world.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:18:47):**  We don't need another beef stick.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:18:50):**  All the people who like grass fed beef for a variety of reasons, high animal welfare,  
**[0:18:55-0:19:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:18:55):**  higher human nutrition, higher sustainability, all of those same things apply to pasture  
**[0:19:01-0:19:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:19:01):**  raised pork and nobody else was making a pasture raised pork stick.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:19:04):**  And there's still very few in the world.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:19:06):**  You know, ours is the only nationally available pasture raised regenerative pork stick that  
**[0:19:11-0:19:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:19:11):**  I'm aware of.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:19:12):**  So that's the first part.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:19:13):**  The second part was that we are thinking, you know, farmers need to be small business  
**[0:19:18-0:19:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:19:18):**  owners, you know, not just the romantic idea of being a farmer, but we need to be able  
**[0:19:22-0:19:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:19:22):**  to read our profit and loss statements and create budgets over, you know, a 12 to 36  
**[0:19:27-0:19:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:19:27):**  month period.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:19:29):**  And the velocity of creating pork is so much faster than the velocity of creating beef.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:19:36):**  You know, so for example, Sal will have her first litter on our place.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:19:41):**  We average about 10 piglets per litter and she will have that litter on her first birthday,  
**[0:19:48-0:19:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:19:48):**  maybe give or take by a few weeks.  
**[0:19:50-0:19:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:19:50):**  You know, so that's 10 pigs created by the end of year one for that animal.  
**[0:19:57-0:19:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:19:57):**  Then six months later, she'll have 10 more.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:19:59):**  So that's 20 pigs created within a 12 month farrowing cycle starting at her first barrowing.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:20:07):**  A cow on the other hand, you know, will probably have her first baby sometime after her second  
**[0:20:12-0:20:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:20:12):**  birthday and that will be a single individual calf produced most commonly.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:20:18):**  And then it'll be another year before she creates one more.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:20:22):**  So pigs are on a different order of magnitude in terms of business, you know, models.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:20:27):**  I can create so much more pork so much faster than I can create beef.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:20:33):**  So that's the first half of it.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:20:34):**  And then for the destruction.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:20:35):**  Yeah.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:20:36):**  That's the last part of the destruction.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:20:37):**  Cause that's where the destruction comes from as well.  
**[0:20:39-0:20:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:20:39):**  For, I mean, our love of pork or cheap pork comes probably from part of that multiplier.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:20:44):**  Yeah, it can, but it also, there's luckily for us, for people who enjoy eating pork,  
**[0:20:51-0:20:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:20:51):**  there is a fork in the road, you know, and the fork in the road comes from just the question,  
**[0:20:57-0:21:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:20:57):**  you know, is it in my best interest to do this regeneratively?  
**[0:21:00-0:21:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:21:00):**  I guess I shouldn't argue any of it, but I will say from my experience, having grown  
**[0:21:04-0:21:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:21:04):**  up raising pigs in a pig barn on slatted floors, it is no fun.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:21:09):**  And you know, the word regenerative applies not only to farming, but it applies to the  
**[0:21:14-0:21:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:21:14):**  human heart.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:21:15):**  You know, it applies to our world.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:21:17):**  How do we feel when we wake up in the morning?  
**[0:21:20-0:21:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:21:20):**  And if your greatest joy is waking up and fixing ventilators in an extremely dusty,  
**[0:21:26-0:21:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:21:26):**  loud, smelly pig barn, if that's your pleasure, then by all means, you know, pursue it.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:21:33):**  But that is not my greatest pleasure.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:21:34):**  You know, my greatest pleasure is watching grass grow, watching pigs eat grass, watching  
**[0:21:39-0:21:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:21:39):**  ecosystems heal, watching the creeks that flow through our pig pastures run clean, you  
**[0:21:44-0:21:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:21:44):**  know, and clear and cold just like they did before our pigs were there.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:21:49):**  And then watching the entire thing grow and become more robust, more resilient over time.  
**[0:21:56-0:22:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:21:56):**  I find a tremendous amount of satisfaction in that and we're able to do that in a profitable  
**[0:22:00-0:22:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:22:00):**  way.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:22:01):**  So my question to people who kind of doubt the ability of pigs to be regenerative is,  
**[0:22:08-0:22:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:22:08):**  I guess it boils down to a choice.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:22:10):**  You know, if someone chooses to farm pigs in the regenerative method and they find joy  
**[0:22:15-0:22:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:22:15):**  and profit both in that, that's a good combination, then I would help all of those people.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:22:21):**  I would share our knowledge.  
**[0:22:22-0:22:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:22:22):**  I would help other people learn how to do what we're doing to create regenerative systems  
**[0:22:27-0:22:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:22:27):**  that are both profitable and healing to the ecosystem.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:22:32):**  So on your land, I'm coming back to the role of pigs.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:22:36):**  Would you say the pig is the ideal one to heal that ecosystem or would ruminants, is  
**[0:22:41-0:22:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:22:41):**  there a role for ruminants or even chickens or what's the cocktail or the recipe needed  
**[0:22:45-0:22:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:22:45):**  to heal the ecosystem where you are in coastal Maine?  
**[0:22:48-0:22:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:22:48):**  Yeah, so I look at nature as our template.  
**[0:22:52-0:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:22:52):**  You know, farming is in one capacity, a form of biomimicry.  
**[0:22:56-0:22:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:22:56):**  So what does nature do?  
**[0:22:58-0:23:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:22:58):**  Because nature has these millions and millions of years that it has developed functioning  
**[0:23:03-0:23:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:23:03):**  systems.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:23:04):**  And humans don't actually create systems.  
**[0:23:07-0:23:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:23:07):**  We look to nature and then we discover, we crack the riddle as best as we can and say,  
**[0:23:12-0:23:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:23:12):**  what systems are already in place?  
**[0:23:14-0:23:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:23:14):**  What physiological or mineral or water, you know, shed pathways are there that I need  
**[0:23:20-0:23:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:23:20):**  to conform to?  
**[0:23:21-0:23:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:23:21):**  So in nature, there are ruminants and non-ruminants.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:23:25):**  But there's got to be a reason for that diversity.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:23:27):**  You know, there's not just one kind of digestive system out there.  
**[0:23:31-0:23:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:23:31):**  So on my farm, we custom graze other people's cows and those cows go ahead of the pigs.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:23:39):**  The pigs follow the cows in a leader follower kind of relationship.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:23:43):**  And so the cows are knocking down a lot of the taller forage, but they're still leaving  
**[0:23:49-0:23:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:23:49):**  a lot.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:23:50):**  When the cows leave a temporary paddock, they will have only consumed between 35 and 40  
**[0:23:56-0:23:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:23:56):**  percent of the available biomass.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:23:58):**  Most of that coming from the leaf tips where most of the available energy and protein is  
**[0:24:02-0:24:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:24:02):**  going to be found.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:24:04):**  They leave the bodies of the plants, which allow the grasses to rebound extremely quickly.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:24:10):**  At the same time, cattle, grass-fed cattle, are only pooping out grass that was already  
**[0:24:17-0:24:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:24:17):**  there when they came in.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:24:19):**  So they are helping...  
**[0:24:21-0:24:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:24:21):**  Of bringing anything.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:24:22):**  Yeah, and not necessarily, but I guess what they are doing is they are helping the earth  
**[0:24:27-0:24:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:24:27):**  to cycle nutrients and to hit the reset button on the grass so that more grass can be produced.  
**[0:24:34-0:24:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:24:34):**  So they are fulfilling an extremely important role.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:24:38):**  Now when the pigs follow them, we're giving the pigs a million pounds of cheese every  
**[0:24:44-0:24:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:24:44):**  year and a million pounds of barley every year.  
**[0:24:49-0:24:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:24:49):**  And then of course, we're going to be supplementing that with non-GMO whole grains.  
**[0:24:54-0:24:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:24:54):**  So let's say that 80 percent of what the pigs consume, they're going to poop back out.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:24:59):**  And that is a net gain for the land.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:25:01):**  So if we're managing for positive animal impact and the pigs get fed, we have movable shade  
**[0:25:08-0:25:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:25:08):**  structures on wheels.  
**[0:25:10-0:25:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:25:10):**  And constantly within a paddock, the pigs are always moving about the paddock.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:25:15):**  Let's say that they're in there for between three and five days.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:25:18):**  We move their shade structures, we move their waters, we move where we feed them.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:25:22):**  This happens every single day.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:25:24):**  So we get this kind of rolling pin effect on the land where we are maneuvering, trampling  
**[0:25:31-0:25:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:25:31):**  and grazing, and then moving.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:25:33):**  So even within the paddock, there's movement.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:25:37):**  And I have never seen someone regenerate and heal soil faster than with that combination.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:25:46):**  You know, the rumen that's doing their part to stamp down the grass, hit the reset button,  
**[0:25:51-0:25:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:25:51):**  the pigs immediately following and re-mineralizing and fertilizing the ground.  
**[0:25:56-0:26:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:25:56):**  Our grazing does not happen on a grazing interval, meaning that we do it every 21 days or every  
**[0:26:01-0:26:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:26:01):**  30 days.  
**[0:26:03-0:26:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:26:03):**  We're not doing it based on a grazing interval.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:26:05):**  We're doing it based on a recovery period.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:26:08):**  So when the grass has rebounded to become rather full in body, that's when the animals  
**[0:26:15-0:26:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:26:15):**  are allowed to come back in.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:26:17):**  And my understanding is that's going to be sequestering carbon the fastest.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:26:21):**  And then the positive impact of the pig or the pigs is turning or taking that input of  
**[0:26:28-0:26:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:26:28):**  the cheese and the barley and the grain and digesting that and basically decomposing it  
**[0:26:34-0:26:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:26:34):**  already partly making it available for the land too.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:26:36):**  Because you're bringing quite a bit of compost.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:26:39):**  It comes out as compost or very available source, and especially in severely degraded  
**[0:26:44-0:26:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:26:44):**  land that kick starts a lot of things.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:26:46):**  Is there an end to that as well?  
**[0:26:47-0:26:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:26:47):**  You see after a number of years, like, okay, this doesn't need pigs anymore.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:26:52):**  So we move to another piece and it just needs ruminants because it has rebounded and it  
**[0:26:56-0:27:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:26:56):**  has the diversity in grass and clovers, et cetera, or it is a continuous system.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:27:00):**  It'll be continuous.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:27:02):**  We can build soil and just keep stacking it up to the sky.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:27:06):**  Right?  
**[0:27:07-0:27:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:27:07):**  Like that's what the process of soil building is.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:27:09):**  And the more soil I can build, the more carbon I can sequester and the more nutrient dense  
**[0:27:14-0:27:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:27:14):**  food I can create.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:27:16):**  So I'll start out answering that question by saying I could take all this cheese and  
**[0:27:21-0:27:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:27:21):**  the barley and just get it for free and throw it on the ground.  
**[0:27:26-0:27:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:27:26):**  And that would probably have a invigorating effect on that soil.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:27:31):**  Right.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:27:32):**  I don't get paid to do that.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:27:33):**  I don't get paid to throw barley on the ground and go home and eat lunch.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:27:37):**  You know, what I get paid for is converting that barley and cheese and grain into something  
**[0:27:44-0:27:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:27:44):**  that was a lot more valuable, which is super premium pasture raised regenerative pork.  
**[0:27:51-0:27:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:27:51):**  And then we go for the kind of the force multiplier effect by funneling that high quality premium  
**[0:27:56-0:28:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:27:56):**  pork into our own brand, which we own.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:28:00):**  And that's how I get paid.  
**[0:28:02-0:28:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:28:02):**  So I get paid from converting barley and cheese and grass and clover into essentially a shelf  
**[0:28:10-0:28:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:28:10):**  stable snack stick, which I sell.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:28:13):**  And that's how we restore our ecosystems.  
**[0:28:16-0:28:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:28:16):**  The more snacks, the more premium pork that we can create, the more ecosystems I can heal.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:28:23):**  And what has been the response of consumers, which I don't think have been used too much  
**[0:28:28-0:28:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:28:28):**  to have this kind of discussion in the non ruminant space?  
**[0:28:32-0:28:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:28:32):**  What has been the education you need to do?  
**[0:28:34-0:28:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:28:34):**  But also general, the response of consumers to a very different pork snack.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:28:39):**  Yeah.  
**[0:28:40-0:28:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:28:40):**  So our pork snack is taste first, because one place where I think that the regenerative  
**[0:28:46-0:28:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:28:46):**  movement misses an opportunity in sales and marketing is quite honestly to talk over the  
**[0:28:53-0:28:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:28:53):**  heads of the consumers.  
**[0:28:55-0:28:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:28:55):**  So we have a fantastic farming system.  
**[0:28:58-0:29:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:28:58):**  We can do things that cannot be done in the conventional world.  
**[0:29:03-0:29:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:29:03):**  And a lot of people value that.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:29:04):**  But we're going to sell our product based on the quality of the eating experience, flavor,  
**[0:29:10-0:29:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:29:10):**  flavor.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:29:11):**  So we create the most delicious pork snack stick in the world.  
**[0:29:15-0:29:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:29:15):**  And I can say that because we've been selling it for several years.  
**[0:29:18-0:29:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:29:18):**  And one of our biggest problems is when we send samples to a grocery store, whoever gets  
**[0:29:23-0:29:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:29:23):**  the sample, eats all of the samples.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:29:27):**  And then the manager never gets a sample to make a decision and buy from.  
**[0:29:31-0:29:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:29:31):**  So we have to send samples more than once.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:29:34):**  This happens all the time.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:29:36):**  People think that they're just so delicious that they make a hog of themselves and they  
**[0:29:41-0:29:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:29:41):**  eat the entire shipment when it gets to the health food store.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:29:45):**  So that's where taste first, where flavor first.  
**[0:29:49-0:29:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:29:49):**  And then since, you know, a lot of people today don't want anonymous food, once they  
**[0:29:55-0:30:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:29:55):**  have seen this is delicious, this is nutritious, this is keto and paleo friendly, we have a  
**[0:30:01-0:30:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:30:01):**  lot of feathers in our hat.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:30:02):**  They can get on our website, our Instagram, our Facebook, they can get on a variety of  
**[0:30:07-0:30:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:30:07):**  channels, they can communicate with us directly if they want to.  
**[0:30:11-0:30:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:30:11):**  And they can dig as deep as they want.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:30:13):**  And if they want to know exactly how spectacularly well our pigs are healing ecosystems, we can  
**[0:30:20-0:30:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:30:20):**  provide them with that information.  
**[0:30:22-0:30:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:30:22):**  If they want to know how our pigs have an exceptional omega-3 to omega-6 ratio, they  
**[0:30:28-0:30:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:30:28):**  can find that information.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:30:30):**  But 90% of our sales are going to come from the product being spectacularly delicious.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:30:36):**  And then we're going to retain those sales from people digging deeper in order to find  
**[0:30:41-0:30:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:30:41):**  out what is this regenerative agriculture thing, why should I care and why is it good  
**[0:30:46-0:30:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:30:46):**  for me?  
**[0:30:47-0:30:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:30:47):**  One of the other benefits of a brand is that you don't only have to sell or maybe at some  
**[0:30:52-0:30:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:30:52):**  point you get to a scale that you need more pigs to make more sticks.  
**[0:30:56-0:31:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:30:56):**  Have you been working and how has that been with other farmers that could supply or are  
**[0:31:01-0:31:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:31:01):**  supplying to you?  
**[0:31:02-0:31:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:31:02):**  And how has been that process of obviously sharing a recipe of how to a recipe or a set  
**[0:31:07-0:31:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:31:07):**  of practices of how to raise pigs that they might have been applying some of them, not  
**[0:31:11-0:31:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:31:11):**  all and how's that journey been if you have been on that road to not only sell your own  
**[0:31:17-0:31:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:31:17):**  pigs to the stick business?  
**[0:31:20-0:31:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:31:20):**  Yeah.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:31:21):**  So it's another part-time job and what has allowed me to teach other farmers is just  
**[0:31:27-0:31:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:31:27):**  as our brand has scaled, I've been able to hire people to manage the logistics and the  
**[0:31:33-0:31:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:31:33):**  accounting and the Instagram and you know what I mean?  
**[0:31:36-0:31:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:31:36):**  I can take more things off of my plate and put it in the hands of a more skillful person  
**[0:31:41-0:31:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:31:41):**  than myself so that I can return to my area of expertise.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:31:46):**  And it is a very deep joy for me to talk to farmers and to share our joys and sorrows  
**[0:31:51-0:31:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:31:51):**  together and yeah, so over the years we've accumulated a fairly broad base of farmers  
**[0:31:57-0:32:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:31:57):**  who raise pork for our brand and one of the great things is that we can share with them  
**[0:32:03-0:32:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:32:03):**  how we do it and not all of them are going to take as much pleasure as I do in watching  
**[0:32:10-0:32:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:32:10):**  pigs eat grass but they can nerd out as much as they want with me and if they don't pursue  
**[0:32:17-0:32:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:32:17):**  it to the 10th degree like I do here at my place, there is a minimum requirements.  
**[0:32:25-0:32:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:32:25):**  You know, those minimum requirements are pasture-raised, heritage breed, non-GMO and antibiotic breed.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:32:30):**  Are you measuring the outcome like Bleu Blanca does in France?  
**[0:32:33-0:32:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:32:33):**  Like are you measuring that omega-3 omega-6 ratio to see not if they're cheating but if  
**[0:32:38-0:32:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:32:38):**  they're not doing the full spectrum of what you're looking for?  
**[0:32:42-0:32:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:32:42):**  Yeah, so we've measured it several times and we've always been very satisfied with our  
**[0:32:47-0:32:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:32:47):**  results.  
**[0:32:48-0:32:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:32:48):**  We've done a couple of USDA funded studies on our farm where we see how much we can push  
**[0:32:54-0:32:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:32:54):**  grass feeding to pigs.  
**[0:32:56-0:33:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:32:56):**  The answer to that one was yes, we can graze pigs exclusively but it's so much work that  
**[0:33:02-0:33:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:33:02):**  I don't know that I could scale it and it's very slow.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:33:06):**  If we have sources of barley and cheese readily on hand for free, then I don't have much incentive  
**[0:33:11-0:33:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:33:11):**  to create a purely grass-fed pork program.  
**[0:33:15-0:33:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:33:15):**  Because the barley and cheese is food waste, like this is not sellable, you're a pig.  
**[0:33:20-0:33:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:33:20):**  That's right, that's right.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:33:21):**  I'm upcycling it.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:33:22):**  I'm getting in between the landfill and the factory, making something valuable out of  
**[0:33:26-0:33:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:33:26):**  it.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:33:27):**  Do you see other farmers you're working with going the same route, like looking for these  
**[0:33:30-0:33:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:33:30):**  upcycle opportunities to speed up but also to upcycle food waste that would have had  
**[0:33:35-0:33:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:33:35):**  potentially biogas if you're very lucky, otherwise a landfill?  
**[0:33:39-0:33:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:33:39):**  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
**[0:33:40-0:33:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:33:40):**  I don't know that they do that as much as I do.  
**[0:33:42-0:33:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:33:42):**  I think that I have a couple of really beautiful advantages that work economically because  
**[0:33:48-0:33:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:33:48):**  of scale and ease of handling.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:33:50):**  I think that we're probably doing that more than a lot of our other farmers.  
**[0:33:55-0:33:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:33:55):**  What's next for the business?  
**[0:33:56-0:33:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:33:56):**  What are the plans?  
**[0:33:57-0:33:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:33:57):**  We're talking summer 2021.  
**[0:33:58-0:34:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:33:58):**  Now, what is ahead?  
**[0:34:00-0:34:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:34:00):**  Yeah, what's ahead?  
**[0:34:02-0:34:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:34:02):**  For the last several years, we've been bootstrapping our operation.  
**[0:34:06-0:34:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:34:06):**  The beauty of that is we learn our mistakes on a small scale.  
**[0:34:10-0:34:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:34:10):**  You gain experience, we grow from them, and we build a very, very broad and stable foundation  
**[0:34:15-0:34:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:34:15):**  for having a well-managed business.  
**[0:34:19-0:34:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:34:19):**  Now after doing that for several years, we don't have any investors.  
**[0:34:23-0:34:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:34:23):**  We're entirely bootstrapped.  
**[0:34:24-0:34:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:34:24):**  We're debt-free and profitable, and we're ready to step on the gas pedal.  
**[0:34:30-0:34:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:34:30):**  In the next year, we're going to look for investors to help us to step on the gas pedal  
**[0:34:35-0:34:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:34:35):**  now that we're confident that we're ready for that.  
**[0:34:39-0:34:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:34:39):**  As we do that, we'll increase our production here on our farm.  
**[0:34:43-0:34:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:34:43):**  Our farm has the capacity to produce about six semi-loads of pigs a year, which would  
**[0:34:50-0:34:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:34:50):**  be about 900 pigs.  
**[0:34:53-0:34:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:34:53):**  We can do all of that regeneratively.  
**[0:34:56-0:35:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:34:56):**  We keep on looking for efficiencies to build into our labor because in order for our program  
**[0:35:02-0:35:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:35:02):**  and our methods to be scalable and to benefit the world at large over time, we need to find  
**[0:35:08-0:35:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:35:08):**  ways of continuing the regenerative effect while decreasing the labor component.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:35:14):**  We think that we see ways of doing that.  
**[0:35:16-0:35:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:35:16):**  You have an example of where the labor is too much at the moment, where you think, okay,  
**[0:35:21-0:35:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:35:21):**  that would be a first because there's a lot of movement involved.  
**[0:35:24-0:35:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:35:24):**  You talk about shape-mobiles and the fencing, etc.  
**[0:35:26-0:35:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:35:26):**  What's the most painful process at the moment?  
**[0:35:29-0:35:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:35:29):**  What's the most labor-intensive one?  
**[0:35:30-0:35:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:35:30):**  I guess for me, there isn't a negative.  
**[0:35:33-0:35:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:35:33):**  It's working out just fine like it is, but just part of the process of relentless improvement  
**[0:35:39-0:35:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:35:39):**  means that we never stop looking for the next horizon.  
**[0:35:43-0:35:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:35:43):**  It's working just fine as it is.  
**[0:35:47-0:35:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:35:47):**  If we were to continue, you know what?  
**[0:35:50-0:35:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:35:50):**  We would have a little bit more permanent fencing.  
**[0:35:53-0:35:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:35:53):**  At present, we just have a perimeter fence that circles our property and everything else  
**[0:35:57-0:36:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:35:57):**  within that 200-acre parcel is flexible.  
**[0:36:03-0:36:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:36:03):**  If we were to put up a little bit more permanent fencing, for example, if we took 100 acres,  
**[0:36:09-0:36:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:36:09):**  has a little driveway down the middle, then we add on each side of it, we had permanent  
**[0:36:14-0:36:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:36:14):**  fencing running parallel to each other and about 100 yards apart.  
**[0:36:18-0:36:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:36:18):**  We could just move, we could basically slide temporary fencing forward and just automatically  
**[0:36:25-0:36:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:36:25):**  be advancing it.  
**[0:36:26-0:36:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:36:26):**  We'd have water lines running down the side of the driveway and everything.  
**[0:36:30-0:36:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:36:30):**  I think that that's our next move for next year is to put up some more permanent fencing  
**[0:36:34-0:36:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:36:34):**  that's essentially high-tensile electric fencing.  
**[0:36:38-0:36:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:36:38):**  From that, we can just use our wind-up reels of poly wire and step-in posts.  
**[0:36:44-0:36:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:36:44):**  We can just do two parallel lines attached to the electrified high-tensile.  
**[0:36:50-0:36:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:36:50):**  I may be getting off too far in the weeds and being too technical.  
**[0:36:54-0:36:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:36:54):**  The infrastructure piece is something people forget.  
**[0:36:59-0:37:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:36:59):**  We had Frank Wootten fence on it and just talking about the cost of fencing for large-scale  
**[0:37:04-0:37:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:37:04):**  grazing operations.  
**[0:37:05-0:37:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:37:05):**  Yeah, of course, it should go realistic, etc.  
**[0:37:08-0:37:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:37:08):**  If you just imagine the amount of fencing you need, if you want to do that permanently,  
**[0:37:13-0:37:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:37:13):**  or the amount of flexible fencing and time you need for large herds, it becomes a very  
**[0:37:18-0:37:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:37:18):**  interesting cost, especially as there's a lot of aging or a lot of infrastructure already  
**[0:37:22-0:37:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:37:22):**  built for a whole different management system.  
**[0:37:25-0:37:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:37:25):**  I think it's extremely relevant.  
**[0:37:27-0:37:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:37:27):**  I would like to ask this question.  
**[0:37:28-0:37:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:37:28):**  If you had a magic wand, you could change one thing in the food and agriculture space.  
**[0:37:33-0:37:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:37:33):**  What would that be?  
**[0:37:34-0:37:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:37:34):**  It could be anything.  
**[0:37:35-0:37:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:37:35):**  It doesn't have to be in the pig or animal protein space.  
**[0:37:36-0:37:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:37:36):**  It could be anything else, but what would the one thing be that you would change overnight?  
**[0:37:41-0:37:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:37:41):**  There may be a couple of things, but I think one thing would be that I would encourage  
**[0:37:46-0:37:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:37:46):**  people to be curious.  
**[0:37:48-0:37:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:37:48):**  I think that sometimes we come to our answers and our conclusions too quickly without enough  
**[0:37:53-0:37:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:37:53):**  curiosity.  
**[0:37:55-0:37:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:37:55):**  That makes greenwashing possible.  
**[0:37:58-0:38:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:37:58):**  It also makes it so you can just put an antibiotic-free label on a pork product, some generic pork  
**[0:38:04-0:38:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:38:04):**  product, and people will imagine all of this good stuff that goes along with it.  
**[0:38:09-0:38:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:38:09):**  It's like the word sustainable.  
**[0:38:11-0:38:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:38:11):**  It either means everything or nothing, depending on who you talk to.  
**[0:38:16-0:38:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:38:16):**  For people to keep open minds and to stay curious, I think is a marvelous part of the  
**[0:38:22-0:38:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:38:22):**  human experience, but I think it's also very important for creating high-quality thought  
**[0:38:27-0:38:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:38:27):**  processes that actually help us achieve our goals.  
**[0:38:30-0:38:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:38:30):**  Curiosity would be my desired outcome of this magic wand.  
**[0:38:35-0:38:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:38:35):**  If you would be in charge of an investment fund, which has an interesting amount of assets  
**[0:38:40-0:38:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:38:40):**  under management, let's say a billion dollars, the investment horizon could be even endless,  
**[0:38:45-0:38:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:38:45):**  could be evergreen, but it's definitely an investment amount.  
**[0:38:47-0:38:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:38:47):**  I'm not asking for dollar by dollar investment advice or investments, but what would you  
**[0:38:52-0:38:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:38:52):**  focus on?  
**[0:38:53-0:38:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:38:53):**  What would your priority be?  
**[0:38:55-0:38:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:38:55):**  Would you buy land?  
**[0:38:56-0:38:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:38:56):**  Would you invest in production facilities?  
**[0:38:57-0:39:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:38:57):**  Would you invest in seeds or something completely different?  
**[0:39:00-0:39:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:39:00):**  It doesn't have to be animal protein related or pork related, but if you would be a fund  
**[0:39:03-0:39:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:39:03):**  manager with, let's say, an interesting amount of resources, what would you focus on for  
**[0:39:08-0:39:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:39:08):**  the regenerative space?  
**[0:39:10-0:39:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:39:10):**  It would be brand based because the brand is where the money changes hands, where the  
**[0:39:17-0:39:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:39:17):**  greatest quantity of money changes hands.  
**[0:39:19-0:39:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:39:19):**  So that's also going to be where the spotlight shines.  
**[0:39:23-0:39:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:39:23):**  So if we had a billion dollars to invest over time, or let's just say a large amount, it  
**[0:39:28-0:39:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:39:28):**  doesn't have to be a billion, billions are all we want, but let's say that we have a  
**[0:39:32-0:39:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:39:32):**  large amount to...  
**[0:39:33-0:39:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:39:33):**  It is, but lately with the billions flying around, I have the feeling I should change  
**[0:39:36-0:39:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:39:36):**  this question to 10 billion because it just...  
**[0:39:38-0:39:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:39:38):**  Ah, okay.  
**[0:39:39-0:39:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:39:39):**  I don't know.  
**[0:39:40-0:39:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:39:40):**  Sure.  
**[0:39:41-0:39:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:39:41):**  It lost a bit of its crazy amount.  
**[0:39:43-0:39:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:39:43):**  That's why I put it there.  
**[0:39:44-0:39:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:39:44):**  But yeah, let's say a lot of money.  
**[0:39:45-0:39:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:39:45):**  Would you be buying brands, building other brands in different places?  
**[0:39:49-0:39:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:39:49):**  Well, so this is not my area of expertise, but I'm still curious.  
**[0:39:55-0:39:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:39:55):**  I follow my own advice.  
**[0:39:56-0:40:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:39:56):**  I'm curious if we had that amount of money, we would find a brand that is a gold standard  
**[0:40:02-0:40:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:40:02):**  for what they're doing, that has some traction, and that creates a large amount of authenticity.  
**[0:40:08-0:40:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:40:08):**  And authenticity is something that a lot of millennials connect with.  
**[0:40:13-0:40:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:40:13):**  Everybody connects with authenticity.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:40:14):**  So we would probably buy something like that, and then we would expand upon the marketing,  
**[0:40:21-0:40:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:40:21):**  grocery, web, online sales.  
**[0:40:24-0:40:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:40:24):**  It would grow everything.  
**[0:40:26-0:40:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:40:26):**  And if you have some control of the brand, and you have some control of its growth and  
**[0:40:30-0:40:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:40:30):**  scale, then at the same time, the more you sell, the more farmers we can work with, and  
**[0:40:37-0:40:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:40:37):**  we can share this body of knowledge with.  
**[0:40:40-0:40:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:40:40):**  If you want to enjoy working with the earth and healing ecosystems, and you want to do  
**[0:40:46-0:40:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:40:46):**  this from home, you don't want to go to town, which is the majority of the farmers that  
**[0:40:50-0:40:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:40:50):**  I work with relate to that sentiment.  
**[0:40:51-0:40:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:40:51):**  They don't want to go to town.  
**[0:40:53-0:40:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:40:53):**  They want to stay with their families in some obscure corner of the countryside, raise their  
**[0:40:58-0:41:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:40:58):**  families, provide for their families, and steward the earth.  
**[0:41:01-0:41:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:41:01):**  And I think that's what I would do, or that's what I would encourage a person who wants  
**[0:41:05-0:41:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:41:05):**  to have a positive effect in the regenerative space, is to acquire a brand, grow that brand,  
**[0:41:12-0:41:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:41:12):**  because the entire movement is going to be sales related, or at least is going to have  
**[0:41:16-0:41:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:41:16):**  a strong element of sales relationship, where we, as farmers or brand managers or owners,  
**[0:41:23-0:41:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:41:23):**  we need to compete with degenerative products.  
**[0:41:27-0:41:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:41:27):**  That is to say products that harm the earth and their creation.  
**[0:41:31-0:41:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:41:31):**  When we replace those with regenerative products, our movement is growing and we're having a  
**[0:41:37-0:41:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:41:37):**  positive impact on the earth.  
**[0:41:39-0:41:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:41:39):**  And how important is online for you to connect directly with your end customers?  
**[0:41:44-0:41:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:41:44):**  It's a slice of the pie and our pie is going to cover Amazon, online retail, online wholesale,  
**[0:41:51-0:41:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:41:51):**  and it's going to cover grocery.  
**[0:41:53-0:41:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:41:53):**  So all of those chess pieces need to be advancing in the way that makes the most sense.  
**[0:41:58-0:42:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:41:58):**  So for us, particularly during COVID, a lot of what we were hearing was that grocery buying  
**[0:42:05-0:42:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:42:05):**  was more like a timed speed mission.  
**[0:42:09-0:42:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:42:09):**  People were running in with their shopping cart, filling their shopping cart with the  
**[0:42:13-0:42:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:42:13):**  exact same 32 items that they get every Friday evening and taking them home as quickly as  
**[0:42:19-0:42:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:42:19):**  they can.  
**[0:42:20-0:42:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:42:20):**  There wasn't a whole lot of exploration of new products happening is what I'm told.  
**[0:42:26-0:42:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:42:26):**  So for us, we focused exclusively online almost for the majority of COVID.  
**[0:42:33-0:42:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:42:33):**  That's where we are stacking our chips at present.  
**[0:42:35-0:42:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:42:35):**  We're driving towards more, whether it's online wholesale or online retail.  
**[0:42:40-0:42:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:42:40):**  Super important because people are still curious about exploring new brands, but they want  
**[0:42:45-0:42:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:42:45):**  to do it from their computer or their phone.  
**[0:42:48-0:42:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:42:48):**  They don't want to linger for an extra 30 minutes in the grocery store reading the back  
**[0:42:53-0:42:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:42:53):**  of a box that they've never seen before.  
**[0:42:55-0:43:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:42:55):**  That hasn't been happening as much in the last year as three years ago, or maybe three  
**[0:43:01-0:43:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:43:01):**  years in the future.  
**[0:43:03-0:43:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:43:03):**  So right now, I think the smart move for a business of my scale is advancing our online  
**[0:43:09-0:43:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:43:09):**  sales right now with an eye on national grocery and distribution because getting into national  
**[0:43:17-0:43:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:43:17):**  grocery and distribution is definitely part of belonging.  
**[0:43:20-0:43:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:43:20):**  And as a final question, what do you believe to be true about regenerative agriculture  
**[0:43:25-0:43:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:43:25):**  that others don't?  
**[0:43:26-0:43:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:43:26):**  And this definitely comes from John Kempf who always asks this question slightly differently.  
**[0:43:30-0:43:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:43:30):**  So where are you contrarian?  
**[0:43:31-0:43:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:43:31):**  You named a few things, but if you had to name one thing where you are different from  
**[0:43:35-0:43:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:43:35):**  the rest of regen movement, apart from that you raise peaks, which is already a bit different.  
**[0:43:39-0:43:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:43:39):**  So there are two, I call them the great mysteries of regenerative.  
**[0:43:45-0:43:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:43:45):**  The first great mystery of regenerative is that the farmer does not directly stuff carbon  
**[0:43:50-0:43:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:43:50):**  into the soil.  
**[0:43:51-0:43:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:43:51):**  We don't directly stuff, you know, omega threes into the meat we're creating.  
**[0:43:57-0:44:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:43:57):**  We are creating circumstances by which the microbiome of the soil can sequester carbon.  
**[0:44:06-0:44:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:44:06):**  Does that make sense?  
**[0:44:07-0:44:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:44:07):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:44:08-0:44:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:44:08):**  We are not literally grabbing the carbon out of the sky and stuffing it into the ground  
**[0:44:12-0:44:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:44:12):**  with a pump.  
**[0:44:13-0:44:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:44:13):**  And we're simply creating the circumstances where that happens as a result of our indirect  
**[0:44:20-0:44:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:44:20):**  actions.  
**[0:44:21-0:44:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:44:21):**  And that is the part of carbon farming, grass farming, regenerative farming, you know, we  
**[0:44:27-0:44:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:44:27):**  want to call it profitable farming.  
**[0:44:29-0:44:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:44:29):**  That's the part of regenerative farming that is the first great mystery.  
**[0:44:34-0:44:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:44:34):**  And it's just that we are going to create the circumstances where carbon sequestration  
**[0:44:39-0:44:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:44:39):**  is possible.  
**[0:44:41-0:44:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:44:41):**  We will not be sequestering the carbon with our own hands ourselves.  
**[0:44:45-0:44:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:44:45):**  That realization enables us to view the earth in a different way.  
**[0:44:49-0:44:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:44:49):**  You know, if we're viewing the earth as a partner or a companion in this journey, it's  
**[0:44:55-0:45:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:44:55):**  not, of course, it's not just the nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium that makes it up.  
**[0:45:00-0:45:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:45:00):**  It's bigger than the sum of its parts.  
**[0:45:02-0:45:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:45:02):**  And viewing the earth in that way is going to help our regenerative efforts.  
**[0:45:06-0:45:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:45:06):**  The second great mystery of the word regenerative is that it most commonly is talked about with  
**[0:45:13-0:45:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:45:13):**  farming, but that it applies to all areas where there is life.  
**[0:45:18-0:45:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:45:18):**  You know, it's going to apply to businesses, families, relationships, friendships.  
**[0:45:24-0:45:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:45:24):**  The word regenerative is going to apply to those things because when a certain quantity  
**[0:45:29-0:45:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:45:29):**  of life giving energy is added to any one of those systems, we're going to see that  
**[0:45:35-0:45:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:45:35):**  multiplier effect kick in and create possibilities which were not possible before.  
**[0:45:41-0:45:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:45:41):**  If in a friendship I am actively letting my friend know that I care about them, then there's  
**[0:45:48-0:45:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:45:48):**  going to be a blossoming effect in that friendship.  
**[0:45:51-0:45:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:45:51):**  There's going to be more openness.  
**[0:45:52-0:45:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:45:52):**  There's going to be people extending themselves, people going the extra mile to do something  
**[0:45:58-0:46:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:45:58):**  good, to do what's right.  
**[0:46:00-0:46:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:46:00):**  And that's what regenerating a friendship looks like.  
**[0:46:03-0:46:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:46:03):**  The same thing is going to apply to all areas where there's life, you know.  
**[0:46:07-0:46:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:46:07):**  And that's a big mystery.  
**[0:46:08-0:46:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:46:08):**  That's the second big mystery.  
**[0:46:10-0:46:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:46:10):**  Once we've graduated from the first great mystery of regenerative, it's going to come  
**[0:46:14-0:46:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:46:14):**  to the second great mystery and realizing that the elements of disruption, rest and  
**[0:46:20-0:46:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:46:20):**  regeneration apply to us, apply to our friends, apply to our families, our businesses and  
**[0:46:27-0:46:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:46:27):**  our soil and our livestock.  
**[0:46:29-0:46:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:46:29):**  And how do you apply that to your business?  
**[0:46:32-0:46:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:46:32):**  We've had Stuart Purpus on the show to talk about Stuart ownership, to have that deep  
**[0:46:36-0:46:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:46:36):**  discussion on ownership.  
**[0:46:37-0:46:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:46:37):**  We had, I will link them below as well, Marcus of New Foundation Farms talking about regenerative  
**[0:46:43-0:46:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:46:43):**  businesses.  
**[0:46:44-0:46:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:46:44):**  How are you applying that in singing pastors, the regenerative business approach?  
**[0:46:49-0:46:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:46:49):**  So we're a savory hub and we're the savory hub for the state of Maine.  
**[0:46:53-0:47:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:46:53):**  And one of the big words that is used in the Savory Institute is the word context.  
**[0:47:00-0:47:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:47:00):**  Context basically means what is your reason for doing something?  
**[0:47:04-0:47:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:47:04):**  And I think one step further and I apply the word context is how do you want to feel when  
**[0:47:09-0:47:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:47:09):**  you wake up in the morning?  
**[0:47:10-0:47:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:47:10):**  How do you want to feel when you go to do your work, your work, your vocation, your  
**[0:47:15-0:47:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:47:15):**  reason for being on earth?  
**[0:47:16-0:47:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:47:16):**  How do you want to feel as you go about that?  
**[0:47:19-0:47:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:47:19):**  I think that that's really important because the regenerative movement is basically founded  
**[0:47:24-0:47:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:47:24):**  on the ideas of disruption, rest and regeneration.  
**[0:47:27-0:47:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:47:27):**  It's the same thing that weightlifters or athletes are going to do a heavy workout followed  
**[0:47:32-0:47:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:47:32):**  by rest, followed by their muscles and lungs and hearts gaining strength.  
**[0:47:37-0:47:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:47:37):**  So many small business owners and farmers have an extremely good work ethic, but I think  
**[0:47:43-0:47:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:47:43):**  that they would benefit from having a regenerative work ethic, which means that you cannot have  
**[0:47:49-0:47:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:47:49):**  disruption followed by disruption followed by disruption followed by disruption and then  
**[0:47:54-0:47:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:47:54):**  expect to grow.  
**[0:47:56-0:48:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:47:56):**  So many studies show that people who work extremely long hours have extremely reduced  
**[0:48:02-0:48:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:48:02):**  creativity and small business owners and farmers, that's going to be not only determination  
**[0:48:08-0:48:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:48:08):**  and work ethic, but creativity getting past the limitations of our own mind and our own  
**[0:48:13-0:48:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:48:13):**  circumstances is going to be what accelerates the growth of our business.  
**[0:48:18-0:48:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:48:18):**  So with that in mind, we have to have a discipline of disruption is good, time of high challenge  
**[0:48:24-0:48:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:48:24):**  where our hearts, our souls, our minds, our bodies, our farms, our businesses are stretched.  
**[0:48:31-0:48:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:48:31):**  People call that growing pains, right?  
**[0:48:33-0:48:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:48:33):**  So we experience our growing pains, but it is mandatory for the quickest growth of a  
**[0:48:40-0:48:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:48:40):**  company.  
**[0:48:41-0:48:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:48:41):**  I'm not just talking about comfortable growth.  
**[0:48:43-0:48:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:48:43):**  I'm saying that if you have disruption followed by disruption followed by more disruption,  
**[0:48:47-0:48:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:48:47):**  you will not have the creativity to achieve goals and make use of opportunities that come  
**[0:48:53-0:48:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:48:53):**  your way or create opportunities that come your way.  
**[0:48:56-0:49:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:48:56):**  So anyway, that's where I'm going with that is farmers need to not just have a good work  
**[0:49:00-0:49:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:49:00):**  ethic, but they have to understand this is how the human psyche functions and it functions  
**[0:49:05-0:49:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:49:05):**  in the same way that our soil, nature, pastures, soil, grass, cattle, pigs, you know, there's  
**[0:49:13-0:49:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:49:13):**  an enormous universal truth that's hidden in this riddle.  
**[0:49:18-0:49:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:49:18):**  And when you crack the riddle, you have more fun.  
**[0:49:19-0:49:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:49:19):**  I want to thank you so much, John, for this interview, which was definitely fun and very  
**[0:49:24-0:49:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:49:24):**  interesting and I learned a lot and wish you good luck with the growth and the rest because  
**[0:49:29-0:49:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:49:29):**  otherwise nothing happens and you won't be created.  
**[0:49:31-0:49:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:49:31):**  Thank you so much for your time.  
**[0:49:33-0:49:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:49:33):**  Thank you.  
**[0:49:34-0:49:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:49:34):**  You have a wonderful day.

**[0:51:44-0:51:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:51:44):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.

**[0:52:03-0:52:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:52:03):**  So what is this course?

**[0:52:11-0:52:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:52:11):**  So you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:52:13-0:52:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:52:13):**  We're going to look into why investing regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:52:18-0:52:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:52:18):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:52:23-0:52:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:52:23):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[0:52:28-0:52:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:52:28):**  if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:52:29-0:52:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:52:29):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:52:34-0:52:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:52:34):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:52:38-0:52:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:52:38):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design, and a lot more.  
**[0:52:43-0:52:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:52:43):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:52:44-0:52:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:52:44):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:52:46-0:52:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:52:46):**  Unfortunately, that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:52:48-0:52:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:52:48):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:52:52-0:52:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:52:52):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:52:54-0:52:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:52:54):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.  
**[0:52:59-0:53:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/john-arbuckle#t=0:52:59):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking.

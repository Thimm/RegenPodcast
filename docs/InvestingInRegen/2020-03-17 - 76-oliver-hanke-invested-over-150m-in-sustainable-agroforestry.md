**[0:00:20-0:00:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:00:20):**  We will discuss how my guest raised 200 million from a German pension fund and has been investing  
**[0:00:25-0:00:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:00:25):**  most of it in the past three years in large-scale sustainable agroforestry.  
**[0:00:30-0:00:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:00:30):**  We will touch upon the fascinating world of aromatic cacao, coconuts, holistic thinking,  
**[0:00:35-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:00:35):**  organic dates, nuts and reforestation.  
**[0:00:38-0:00:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:00:38):**  I hope you enjoy this slightly longer interview as we had so much to unpack on how to put  
**[0:00:43-0:00:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:00:43):**  trillions to work in trees.  
**[0:00:47-0:00:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:00:47):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture.  
**[0:00:51-0:00:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:00:51):**  Investing as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:53-0:00:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:00:53):**  This show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:57-0:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:00:57):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:01:03-0:01:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:01:03):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:01:07):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:09-0:01:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:01:09):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:13-0:01:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:01:13):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:01:16):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:21-0:01:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:01:21):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:25-0:01:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:01:25):**  In March last year we launched our Patreon community to make it easy for fans to support  
**[0:01:29-0:01:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:01:29):**  our work and so many of you have joined as a member.

**[0:01:50-0:01:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:01:50):**  My next guest is Chief Project Officer at 123, the pioneers in making sustainable forestry  
**[0:01:56-0:01:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:01:56):**  and agriculture projects investable at a large scale.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:01:59):**  Welcome Oliver.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:02:00):**  Hello Kun, how are you?  
**[0:02:01-0:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:02:01):**  I'm very good.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:02:02):**  I'm very much looking forward to this discussion.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:02:03):**  I think we're going to have a lot to discuss, a lot to have a conversation about, about  
**[0:02:08-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:02:08):**  institutional investments in regenerative agriculture and forestry.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:02:12):**  But first of all, a personal question.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:02:14):**  What brings you to the space of large scale agroforestry projects and the investment side  
**[0:02:19-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:02:19):**  of things?  
**[0:02:20-0:02:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:02:20):**  Well, thank you for inviting me.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:02:22):**  First of all, it's a good question.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:02:24):**  I mean, it's not like I've been in the space of agriculture and forestry all my life.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:02:29):**  So if I look back at my career, I've actually, as people often say, have been on the dark  
**[0:02:35-0:02:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:02:35):**  side.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:02:36):**  So I've been involved in finance and private banking, started actually in real estate.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:02:42):**  And about 10 years ago, I'd say I decided to actually move away from that side, but  
**[0:02:49-0:02:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:02:49):**  not entirely, obviously, it's still very much part of my daily job.  
**[0:02:54-0:03:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:02:54):**  But to focus on the topic of sustainable asset management, on creating a value proposition,  
**[0:03:00-0:03:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:03:00):**  obviously, with my colleagues, how sustainable or regenerative agriculture and sustainable  
**[0:03:06-0:03:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:03:06):**  forestry models can be made investable at large scale by institutional investors.  
**[0:03:14-0:03:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:03:14):**  And that is, if you want, so the intellectual answer.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:03:16):**  So I saw a real need for that.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:03:20):**  And we think that one to tree provides an answer in that space that hasn't been yet  
**[0:03:27-0:03:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:03:27):**  provided by many organizations.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:03:29):**  It's the answer to the question, how can I invest considerable funds, let's say 50 million  
**[0:03:35-0:03:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:03:35):**  or 100 million dollars or more in projects that are operating according to sustainable  
**[0:03:42-0:03:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:03:42):**  land use practices?  
**[0:03:44-0:03:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:03:44):**  On a more emotional level, I think it's just the state of the world out there and to do  
**[0:03:51-0:03:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:03:51):**  the best and to contribute as much as possible, basically be a net contributor rather than  
**[0:03:57-0:04:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:03:57):**  to actually use up the resources.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:04:00):**  And that's what made me come into this space.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:04:03):**  And in the last years, we did see the whole space to gain a lot of traction.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:04:08):**  That's good to see.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:04:09):**  And obviously, it's also positive for my personal life decisions to show that that was a good  
**[0:04:15-0:04:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:04:15):**  decision to make.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:04:17):**  And I mean, there's a lot to unpack here, but we have time.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:04:20):**  So we're going to do that.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:04:21):**  So can you give a short, short overview?  
**[0:04:23-0:04:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:04:23):**  I know one to three quite well, I feel and I will definitely share your impact report,  
**[0:04:29-0:04:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:04:29):**  which you made public in the end of last year or somewhere, I think, in fall of last year,  
**[0:04:33-0:04:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:04:33):**  I will share that below.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:04:34):**  And we can you share give a short intro into one, two, three.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:04:38):**  What is it?  
**[0:04:39-0:04:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:04:39):**  Are you not on that impact report?  
**[0:04:41-0:04:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:04:41):**  So that what you saw was just the executive summary, basically the pre version.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:04:46):**  So I can happily announce that we just as per this week, we completed the full report.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:04:51):**  I'm very happy to share that.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:04:53):**  Wow.  
**[0:04:54-0:04:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:04:54):**  Yeah, because I love the summary, very visual, very detailed for a summary, but I'm definitely  
**[0:04:58-0:05:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:04:58):**  going to dive into the full report.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:05:01):**  Okay.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:05:02):**  So to your question, what is one to three?  
**[0:05:05-0:05:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:05:05):**  So one to three is based in Germany, is a German company.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:05:09):**  Well, German company, we're an international company, of course.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:05:14):**  And we focus on developing large scale agroforestry models mostly and forestry projects, predominantly  
**[0:05:24-0:05:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:05:24):**  in Latin America, but more and more so also in Africa, that combine traditional land use  
**[0:05:33-0:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:05:33):**  practices, agroforestry practices, but at the same time, embrace modern research, modern  
**[0:05:40-0:05:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:05:40):**  precision agriculture principles, and show or try to demonstrate that this type of agriculture  
**[0:05:48-0:05:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:05:48):**  and forestry can be done at large scale, that it can be done in a profitable way, that it  
**[0:05:53-0:05:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:05:53):**  can be done in a very socially responsible and ecological way.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:05:59):**  And to make this available to large institutional investors, such as pension funds, endowments,  
**[0:06:07-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:06:07):**  foundations, asset managers, insurers, who are seeking to deploy considerable funds in  
**[0:06:15-0:06:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:06:15):**  this kind of space, but are limited by the traditional impact investment industry, which  
**[0:06:22-0:06:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:06:22):**  is doing great things, but it's doing it at a much smaller scale.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:06:27):**  So if I want to invest 50 million euro into a project or several projects, then there's  
**[0:06:33-0:06:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:06:33):**  a real limitation in the market to do that.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:06:36):**  So we are an investment advisor, we build a very efficient asset management platform  
**[0:06:42-0:06:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:06:42):**  for that and very detailed investment process with a very good team based in Berlin.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:06:50):**  But we're also a project developer, and we do the project supervision locally.  
**[0:06:56-0:07:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:06:56):**  So we have a lot of people, experts on the ground, agronomists, foresters, technicians,  
**[0:07:04-0:07:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:07:04):**  who supervise the projects that we develop together with our local implementation partners.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:07:10):**  And that's how we operate, basically.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:07:11):**  It's a combination.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:07:12):**  And I think in that sense, it is very rare still to have that strong asset management  
**[0:07:18-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:07:18):**  capability and at the same time, very in-depth on the ground agricultural management expertise.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:07:26):**  So that's what we try to combine.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:07:29):**  And that's what we're doing since we set up the company at the end of 2016.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:07:34):**  Yeah, so basically, we're getting into the fourth year, which is exactly when I set up  
**[0:07:40-0:07:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:07:40):**  the podcast, funny enough, which is the two of them are not connected, but the end of  
**[0:07:44-0:07:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:07:44):**  16 was an interesting period.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:07:46):**  And you've done so with a lot of success so far, or at least success in terms of committed  
**[0:07:51-0:07:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:07:51):**  capital and invested capital.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:07:52):**  I think I saw in the summary of the impact report, you have 200 million committed and  
**[0:07:58-0:08:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:07:58):**  130 million invested in the past three years.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:08:03):**  Probably a lot of people in the podcast think, wow, that sounds like a lot of money, obviously,  
**[0:08:07-0:08:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:08:07):**  for institutional investment sizes.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:08:09):**  That is not so much, but in the agroforestry space, that's enormous.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:08:12):**  Can you walk us through or explain a bit how that happened and how in the last three years,  
**[0:08:19-0:08:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:08:19):**  you've had so many commitments or commitments for so much money and also the investment  
**[0:08:23-0:08:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:08:23):**  side of things?  
**[0:08:24-0:08:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:08:24):**  How do you deploy 130 million in three years?  
**[0:08:27-0:08:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:08:27):**  Well, yeah, that's enough for three podcasts, I guess.  
**[0:08:31-0:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:08:31):**  Well unpack, unpack.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:08:34):**  So no, you're right.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:08:35):**  That's exactly one of the key problems.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:08:37):**  So for the agroforestry space, this is a vast amount of money for institutional investors.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:08:44):**  It's well, it still is a lot of money and considerable ticket.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:08:48):**  But comparing it to the billions that, let's say, a pension fund has to invest, it's a  
**[0:08:54-0:08:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:08:54):**  relatively small amount.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:08:57):**  But yeah, how did we come about this?  
**[0:09:02-0:09:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:09:02):**  It's not something that happened overnight.  
**[0:09:03-0:09:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:09:03):**  It was actually a very long process that went into it, a lot of pitching, a lot of education  
**[0:09:11-0:09:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:09:11):**  also in the sense of explaining what is agroforestry, what is permaculture, what is regenerative  
**[0:09:21-0:09:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:09:21):**  agriculture and why is this better than, let's say, a traditional timber investment into,  
**[0:09:29-0:09:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:09:29):**  I don't know, pulp and paper.  
**[0:09:32-0:09:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:09:32):**  So it's not like pension funds or insurers, large asset managers haven't invested in forestry  
**[0:09:42-0:09:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:09:42):**  before or also in agriculture, but obviously more in conventional projects and production.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:09:49):**  And to explain and to convince them that this can be done in a very different way.  
**[0:09:55-0:10:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:09:55):**  What do you say then to, like, imagine I'm a German pension fund or a Dutch pension fund  
**[0:10:00-0:10:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:10:00):**  or let's say one of the pension funds that's not really known to be super pioneering because  
**[0:10:04-0:10:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:10:04):**  they shouldn't, they should be conservative with managing our pensions and they are used  
**[0:10:08-0:10:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:10:08):**  to maybe some agriculture investments and timber investments, but they never combined  
**[0:10:12-0:10:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:10:12):**  the two.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:10:13):**  Maybe they have heard of agroforestry, but they're not really sure what that is.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:10:17):**  How do you have that conversation about the returns are there, the future is going there,  
**[0:10:23-0:10:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:10:23):**  what is permaculture, what is soil, what's the starting point of how are those conversations  
**[0:10:26-0:10:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:10:26):**  going?  
**[0:10:27-0:10:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:10:27):**  Well, I mean, I guess you have to start with the topics that they care about most and that  
**[0:10:33-0:10:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:10:33):**  is what are their objectives?  
**[0:10:37-0:10:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:10:37):**  I mean, as you rightly say, they are responsible for the pension monies of thousands of people  
**[0:10:45-0:10:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:10:45):**  and rightly so you don't want them to play around with that.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:10:49):**  So they are very risk averse.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:10:51):**  At the same time, they have return objectives that they need to achieve in a world, in an  
**[0:10:59-0:11:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:10:59):**  investment climate that since years is becoming more and more difficult.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:11:04):**  So there has been a general move towards alternative investments, towards liquid investments, which  
**[0:11:12-0:11:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:11:12):**  were unthinkable at this scale for pension funds and in, let's say, large mandates some  
**[0:11:21-0:11:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:11:21):**  years ago.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:11:22):**  But now it's common practice that people invest in illiquid investments, that they invest  
**[0:11:28-0:11:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:11:28):**  in, let's say, renewable energy projects, that they invest in emerging markets because  
**[0:11:33-0:11:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:11:33):**  that's where they can still generate a return for their beneficiaries.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:11:39):**  Now keeping that in mind, so that should make it easier for our kind of topic because that's  
**[0:11:47-0:11:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:11:47):**  all what we do.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:11:48):**  Those are, if you look at a large agroforestry project, it is at its core, first of all,  
**[0:11:55-0:12:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:11:55):**  it's an infrastructure project and it's typically in emerging markets.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:12:00):**  It's agriculture, which in the case of our topics such as cacao and coffee and coconut  
**[0:12:11-0:12:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:12:11):**  palm oil production and things like that, it takes years before you actually have production.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:12:17):**  So all these topics are, each piece of that are known elements to institutional investment  
**[0:12:26-0:12:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:12:26):**  managers.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:12:27):**  It's just maybe the combination plus the added pressure of converting to something more sustainable  
**[0:12:35-0:12:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:12:35):**  to something climate positive than rather climate negative, if you want so.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:12:41):**  That is a new dimension to them.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:12:43):**  But you also have to see that there's a lot of regulatory pressure coming now to the institutional  
**[0:12:48-0:12:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:12:48):**  investment world to follow or to implement ESG principles, to properly assess impact  
**[0:12:59-0:13:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:12:59):**  and to look into your climate risks, basically, and to make them transparent.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:13:07):**  There will be a lot of additional regulation in this space.  
**[0:13:10-0:13:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:13:10):**  So there is a real interest to learn more about this and that's where you have to get  
**[0:13:15-0:13:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:13:15):**  them.  
**[0:13:16-0:13:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:13:16):**  And you're absolutely right, maybe the German market, as an example, isn't as advanced when  
**[0:13:23-0:13:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:13:23):**  it comes to these topics as the UK, the Netherlands and the Nordics, to point them out.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:13:31):**  And also Switzerland, let's say generally speaking, is quite at the forefront of sustainable  
**[0:13:40-0:13:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:13:40):**  asset management, not necessarily the institutional investors there.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:13:44):**  So after a lot of education, probably a number of trips to interesting examples, because  
**[0:13:50-0:13:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:13:50):**  you have a background in sustainable forestry management, you convinced this German pension  
**[0:13:56-0:14:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:13:56):**  fund to commit 200 million and you get to work.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:14:00):**  So what how does it look like?  
**[0:14:02-0:14:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:14:02):**  What kind of can you give an example of an agroforestry project that you bought, invested  
**[0:14:07-0:14:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:14:07):**  in and how does the change look like basically since you came in?  
**[0:14:11-0:14:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:14:11):**  Sure.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:14:12):**  So as you said, it's for the agroforestry space, 200 million is a tremendous amount of  
**[0:14:17-0:14:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:14:17):**  money as there aren't that many projects out there at large scale.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:14:23):**  And in our case, the kind of projects that we like to implement, they focus a lot on  
**[0:14:28-0:14:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:14:28):**  on on cacao, which is one of our core competencies also on the on the technical group sites or  
**[0:14:36-0:14:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:14:36):**  operations team has had has a lot of cacao management expertise, but also many other  
**[0:14:43-0:14:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:14:43):**  tropical crops.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:14:45):**  And typically the development of these projects is rather capital intensive.  
**[0:14:51-0:15:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:14:51):**  So tree orchards are to develop tree orchards is much more expensive than annual crop production.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:15:03):**  And so we're talking about areas of let's say 1000 to 5000 hectares, and not necessarily  
**[0:15:09-0:15:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:15:09):**  10s of 1000s of hectares that you may develop in other crops.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:15:17):**  So how do you go about this?  
**[0:15:18-0:15:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:15:18):**  I mean, the the value proposition is obviously to turn degraded land into highly productive  
**[0:15:26-0:15:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:15:26):**  land to bring it back into agricultural production ideally.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:15:30):**  And the best circumstances we start with degraded cattle, cattle land if you want to.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:15:38):**  So that not only we replace cattle raising with with an agroforestry system, but we also  
**[0:15:47-0:15:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:15:47):**  bring highly compacted and degraded soil back into production.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:15:53):**  So you need to find appropriate project areas or pieces of land.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:15:59):**  And that is where where it starts.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:16:01):**  So you need people on the ground.  
**[0:16:03-0:16:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:16:03):**  We are very focused on, let's say Central America and northern parts of Latin America.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:16:11):**  And it starts with your pipeline of projects, you have to you have to do landscouting, you  
**[0:16:16-0:16:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:16:16):**  have to find appropriate science, you have to build a network, you have to identify suitable  
**[0:16:24-0:16:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:16:24):**  markets that lend themselves to the business model that you have in mind.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:16:30):**  You start acquiring them or establishing lease models.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:16:35):**  So we're not very dogmatic about does land have to be acquired or should it be a lease  
**[0:16:43-0:16:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:16:43):**  or use a fruit model, you know, it form follows function here, you do the best possible setup.  
**[0:16:51-0:16:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:16:51):**  And so we established a project pipeline, we selected the best prospective sites to  
**[0:16:59-0:17:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:16:59):**  start with.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:17:00):**  We focused obviously on countries where we already had teams in place, which was in in  
**[0:17:05-0:17:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:17:05):**  Panama and in Colombia.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:17:08):**  In particular, Colombia is obviously a vast country full of opportunity and a place that  
**[0:17:14-0:17:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:17:14):**  we like a lot.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:17:16):**  And you start building from there.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:17:19):**  So overall, we have now invested in seven countries and 12 projects that are now under  
**[0:17:28-0:17:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:17:28):**  our belt, if you want so, ranging in size and investment.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:17:34):**  So we started with some smaller ones and the biggest investment that we made was in the  
**[0:17:39-0:17:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:17:39):**  range of 40 million US dollars.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:17:43):**  So quite a sizable investment.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:17:46):**  And that was only possible by being very focused on the land scouting to have a dedicated project  
**[0:17:55-0:18:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:17:55):**  development team to find good partners, trusted partners.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:18:00):**  I always say without trusted partners, you're lost, you have no chance of success.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:18:06):**  You cannot do everything yourself.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:18:07):**  You have to rely on local knowledge, expertise, you have to find these people who you can  
**[0:18:13-0:18:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:18:13):**  partner with, who will develop new production with you.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:18:20):**  And that was the starting point, to find the right suitable land.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:18:27):**  Now we've done this for three years, which was a tremendous amount of work for the entire  
**[0:18:32-0:18:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:18:32):**  organization.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:18:33):**  We're now almost 35 people, I think, say two thirds of them being in the project countries  
**[0:18:41-0:18:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:18:41):**  and one third being at headquarters in Europe.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:18:45):**  But now the real challenge starts, which is we have started to develop these projects,  
**[0:18:50-0:18:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:18:50):**  we have bought farms and we convert them to more sustainable.  
**[0:18:55-0:18:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:18:55):**  And how does that look like?  
**[0:18:56-0:19:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:18:56):**  Like you buy, I mean, you can do of course a concrete example or like a cattle farm rundown.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:19:01):**  Like what's the change you see?  
**[0:19:04-0:19:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:19:04):**  We're obviously in audio, so be as visual as you can be of what can we see the changes  
**[0:19:09-0:19:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:19:09):**  that are already happening and that are happening in the future for somebody that probably hasn't  
**[0:19:14-0:19:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:19:14):**  seen, let's say large scale agroforestry projects up close.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:19:18):**  Yeah, sure.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:19:19):**  I give you two examples because we do two different things.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:19:22):**  One thing is we buy farms that are running, doing conventional agriculture and they're  
**[0:19:28-0:19:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:19:28):**  trying their best, but they're struggling.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:19:31):**  So we find these sort of opportunities for conversion, to make them more socially responsible  
**[0:19:38-0:19:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:19:38):**  to bring up, just produce better quality and more of it, but to do it in a resource efficient  
**[0:19:46-0:19:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:19:46):**  fashion.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:19:47):**  Maybe I could give you one example on that.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:19:49):**  And then the other is that we develop entirely new production.  
**[0:19:53-0:20:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:19:53):**  So that's in a way that is almost easier for us because you start with a white sheet of  
**[0:20:00-0:20:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:20:00):**  paper or with a green field, so a green field project basically.  
**[0:20:03-0:20:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:20:03):**  Yeah, basically the reforestation part versus the better forest management or better land  
**[0:20:10-0:20:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:20:10):**  management as you mentioned.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:20:11):**  But two examples would be great.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:20:12):**  Yeah, both is important.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:20:14):**  So I give you one example for a farm conversion.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:20:16):**  So we bought in 2018, we bought a cocoa farm in the north of Colombia.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:20:26):**  Project is called Macan Cal.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:20:29):**  And it's basically a monoculture that was planted in a way that wasn't bad, producing  
**[0:20:37-0:20:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:20:37):**  CCM51, which is let's say bulk cocoa, so not particularly fine flavor type of cocoa, but  
**[0:20:46-0:20:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:20:46):**  it's yielding well.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:20:48):**  And they installed it in a good way.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:20:51):**  It was designed to be mechanized as well, in principle a good farm, but they ran into  
**[0:20:57-0:21:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:20:57):**  real operational problems with changing climate patterns.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:21:01):**  So more and more extended drought periods and during an extended El Nino period, basically  
**[0:21:08-0:21:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:21:08):**  the water concept failed.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:21:10):**  They ran dry and a very large part of the plantation died.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:21:15):**  There's just not enough water.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:21:17):**  So there was an irrigation system, but there wasn't enough water to feed it.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:21:22):**  Another contributor, funnily enough, this was in a farmer-fark conflict area in Colombia.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:21:29):**  And with the conflict being resolved largely and sort of peace coming back to the region,  
**[0:21:36-0:21:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:21:36):**  there's also more and more agriculture happening again and basically more water being taken  
**[0:21:41-0:21:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:21:41):**  out of the rivers that feed the farm.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:21:44):**  So many reasons contributed to that.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:21:47):**  So what did we do?  
**[0:21:50-0:21:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:21:50):**  So we bought this farm and how we typically approach this is that we have different phases  
**[0:21:55-0:21:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:21:55):**  that we look at.  
**[0:21:56-0:22:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:21:56):**  So the first phase, which is obviously the most important one, is to immediately stop  
**[0:22:01-0:22:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:22:01):**  destructive practices.  
**[0:22:04-0:22:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:22:04):**  That means introducing proper waste management, introducing recycling, obviously looking at  
**[0:22:11-0:22:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:22:11):**  work contracts, employment conditions.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:22:13):**  So all of our workers have social insurance and health insurance.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:22:19):**  So that is something that needs to happen immediately.  
**[0:22:22-0:22:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:22:22):**  It's obviously about safety at work.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:22:24):**  So we're looking as quickly as possible at health and safety procedures, issuing protective  
**[0:22:32-0:22:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:22:32):**  gear, looking at the machinery that is being used, starting with courses, education.  
**[0:22:40-0:22:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:22:40):**  You may argue, well, all of that, which is good agricultural practice under a certified  
**[0:22:46-0:22:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:22:46):**  operation.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:22:47):**  Well, that is true.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:22:48):**  But in practice, it often doesn't happen and it often even doesn't happen on certified  
**[0:22:52-0:22:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:22:52):**  farms.  
**[0:22:53-0:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:22:53):**  And you know that as well.  
**[0:22:56-0:22:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:22:56):**  So that is something that we immediately do.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:22:58):**  We look at the workforce, we talk to them.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:23:02):**  You may be surprised how much of an impact that had.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:23:05):**  Many of the workers who've been there for decades, they told us, this is the first time  
**[0:23:11-0:23:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:23:11):**  actually a boss talks to us like an investor, an owner, asks me what I think, what could  
**[0:23:20-0:23:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:23:20):**  be done better.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:23:23):**  And that's what our regional managers did.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:23:26):**  They went there, they opened a dialogue, they asked what can be done.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:23:32):**  We hired two HR personnel with a psychological background to work on various problems in  
**[0:23:43-0:23:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:23:43):**  the farm, but also in the families, in the communities surrounding.  
**[0:23:48-0:23:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:23:48):**  And I didn't even talk yet about the agriculture.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:23:52):**  That's just the social work that needs to be done immediately.  
**[0:23:56-0:23:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:23:56):**  When it comes to agriculture, then it's a bit more difficult.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:23:59):**  So here we had a massive water problem and we needed to replant some area.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:24:04):**  So first thing was to obtain construction permit to build a large rainwater catchment  
**[0:24:12-0:24:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:24:12):**  area and a reservoir, which we did.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:24:18):**  And so we stabilized the water situation by basically investing quite a considerable amount  
**[0:24:23-0:24:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:24:23):**  of money into a large reservoir, improving the efficiency of the installed irrigation  
**[0:24:29-0:24:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:24:29):**  systems and just improving the way water is used and how to catch it and to store it.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:24:38):**  And now that we have completed that, we can actually focus on changing the production  
**[0:24:44-0:24:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:24:44):**  system itself.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:24:46):**  So I mentioned at the beginning, it's a monoculture, but they're good trees.  
**[0:24:52-0:24:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:24:52):**  They've been stressed, of course, but they are yielding.  
**[0:24:55-0:24:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:24:55):**  They're not yet that old that we need to rip them out.  
**[0:24:58-0:25:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:24:58):**  So we're focusing on gradual improvement rather than radical change.  
**[0:25:04-0:25:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:25:04):**  So we focused a lot on the health of the trees.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:25:07):**  We focus, generally speaking, a lot on the health of the soil.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:25:11):**  So to implement very precise fertilization programs and work a lot with soil analysis  
**[0:25:21-0:25:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:25:21):**  to really have a precise nutrition plan for the farm.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:25:27):**  And that is currently what we're doing.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:25:28):**  So there's a lot of quality work going in at the moment to bring up the quality of the  
**[0:25:32-0:25:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:25:32):**  crop.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:25:33):**  We build a lot of infrastructure when it comes to post-harvest.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:25:39):**  So basically to dry or to ferment and dry the cocoa in a controlled environment rather  
**[0:25:48-0:25:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:25:48):**  than just on the ground as it was done before, or it was even sold wet to local traders.  
**[0:25:57-0:26:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:25:57):**  So we always focus on premium because the way we produce is more expensive, maybe.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:26:05):**  So we focus on producing premium products that can be exported.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:26:10):**  And those are the things that are currently on the way at this particular farm.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:26:13):**  So you can imagine it's quite a lot of work.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:26:18):**  We kept the original management team.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:26:20):**  It was a very good management team, I have to say.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:26:23):**  They just didn't have the opportunity to actually implement the suggestions that they were making  
**[0:26:28-0:26:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:26:28):**  themselves with the old owners.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:26:32):**  So given the right support, consultants, advice, access to resources and knowledge, they turned  
**[0:26:42-0:26:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:26:42):**  this around rather quickly.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:26:43):**  And it's already a model case, I would say, for a conversion.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:26:48):**  And where do you see that going?  
**[0:26:50-0:26:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:26:50):**  Because you mentioned it's currently a monoculture.  
**[0:26:53-0:26:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:26:53):**  It's not a very... it was focused on much more of a bulk cocoa.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:26:58):**  Do you see this going much more complex, less of a monoculture?  
**[0:27:03-0:27:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:27:03):**  I mean, a number of the trees died, so you are replanting.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:27:06):**  And what do you see this going in like five to 10 years?  
**[0:27:09-0:27:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:27:09):**  Well that's our opportunity.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:27:10):**  So as I said, I'm not going to start rip out thousands of trees just because I want a biodiverse  
**[0:27:15-0:27:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:27:15):**  system.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:27:18):**  But whenever we get the opportunity, and here we do have an opportunity because many of  
**[0:27:24-0:27:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:27:24):**  the trees died or were severely stressed so that they stopped producing, we get a chance  
**[0:27:31-0:27:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:27:31):**  to replant.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:27:32):**  And we're replanting with aromatic cocoa.  
**[0:27:35-0:27:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:27:35):**  We're introducing shade trees.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:27:38):**  What is aromatic cocoa?  
**[0:27:39-0:27:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:27:39):**  It's for a non-chocolate... because I've been in the office, just a bit of background.  
**[0:27:43-0:27:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:27:43):**  I've been in the office of 123 and they know a lot about chocolate.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:27:48):**  Like a lot of flavors.  
**[0:27:49-0:27:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:27:49):**  They can test chocolate in very interesting ways.  
**[0:27:52-0:27:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:27:52):**  But I also, I'm aware that maybe not everyone on the broadcast is a chocolate... maybe a  
**[0:27:57-0:27:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:27:57):**  chocolate fan, but not a chocolate expert.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:27:59):**  So what is aromatic cocoa?  
**[0:28:00-0:28:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:28:00):**  Yeah, sure.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:28:01):**  No, I mean, we tend to forget that not everyone is fanatic about chocolate and cacao.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:28:06):**  So well, I mean, obviously there is the cacao industry or the chocolate industry is full  
**[0:28:15-0:28:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:28:15):**  of flaws.  
**[0:28:16-0:28:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:28:16):**  And I mean, we could talk about that for hours as well.  
**[0:28:20-0:28:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:28:20):**  But let's say there's a bulk market which produces the kind of cocoa that goes into  
**[0:28:27-0:28:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:28:27):**  your mass market products, is mixed with a lot of milk and sugar.  
**[0:28:32-0:28:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:28:32):**  And there the flavor doesn't actually matter that much.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:28:34):**  So if you eat your typical Mars bar, Snickers, that kind of thing, yes, there's chocolate  
**[0:28:40-0:28:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:28:40):**  in there, there's cocoa in there, but the cocoa content is very low.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:28:45):**  So how that cacao actually... what the flavor profile of that is, it doesn't matter.  
**[0:28:51-0:29:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:28:51):**  To these producers, the majority of the product is more important than the actual flavor.  
**[0:29:02-0:29:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:29:02):**  There's a different segment which is called fine flavor cocoa or aromatic cocoa, which  
**[0:29:08-0:29:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:29:08):**  is what people get passionate about.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:29:12):**  So you have a lot of cocoa varieties that... well, cocoa comes originally from the Amazon  
**[0:29:18-0:29:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:29:18):**  rainforest.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:29:20):**  And as with most crops, people pick the ones that are most sturdy and the high yielding,  
**[0:29:26-0:29:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:29:26):**  but don't necessarily have the best flavor profile that went into Mars production.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:29:32):**  But if you're passionate about cocoa, then you have a lot of single origins and very  
**[0:29:38-0:29:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:29:38):**  different types of flavors.  
**[0:29:39-0:29:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:29:39):**  And we always compare it to wine.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:29:41):**  It's as complex as wine.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:29:43):**  You can talk about it for hours.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:29:46):**  So people talk about single domain, if you want so, or single estate cocoa that comes  
**[0:29:53-0:29:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:29:53):**  from one particular farm.  
**[0:29:55-0:30:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:29:55):**  And there are a lot of different clones and so-called criollos, basically wild varieties  
**[0:30:02-0:30:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:30:02):**  that are grown somewhere, which can have real... create real flavor explosions in your mouth.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:30:09):**  So it's quite interesting.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:30:13):**  As with anything, if you dig into it, there is a world to be explored.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:30:16):**  So it's just as interesting as wine production or coffee.  
**[0:30:22-0:30:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:30:22):**  Some people...  
**[0:30:23-0:30:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:30:23):**  I was going to say, I mean, definitely are passionate about coffee and it's very similar  
**[0:30:29-0:30:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:30:29):**  here.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:30:30):**  So that's the market.  
**[0:30:31-0:30:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:30:31):**  I think that's your opportunity, right?  
**[0:30:32-0:30:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:30:32):**  You see this, the cocoa market is moving.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:30:35):**  Yes.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:30:36):**  Probably, I don't know, many years, but a bit behind coffee that has seen an explosion  
**[0:30:40-0:30:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:30:40):**  in single origin, extreme special roasting, a lot of very, very enthusiastic people.  
**[0:30:46-0:30:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:30:46):**  And you see sort of the chocolate market moving after that as well, the cacao market.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:30:51):**  But on the production side, I'm imagining that's your gap.  
**[0:30:54-0:30:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:30:54):**  That's where you're stepping in, that there's not a lot of this aromatic cacao at a large  
**[0:30:58-0:31:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:30:58):**  scale to be sold to the single bar or bean to bar makers around the world.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:31:03):**  Well, that's the thing.  
**[0:31:04-0:31:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:31:04):**  So, I mean, first of all, these single, let's say, bean to bar makers are basically controlling  
**[0:31:10-0:31:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:31:10):**  the whole process from the bean to the final chocolate bar.  
**[0:31:15-0:31:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:31:15):**  There are obviously a lot of these, let's say, very motivated and great companies who  
**[0:31:21-0:31:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:31:21):**  produce, but they need a couple of tons a year to produce their chocolate.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:31:27):**  And that's typically then dark chocolate.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:31:28):**  So they don't mix it with a lot of sugar and milk.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:31:32):**  It goes up to 100%, which is, to be honest, 100% cocoa content.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:31:37):**  That's a bit too tough for me.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:31:38):**  That's interesting.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:31:39):**  I've done a tasting and you could see, I think half of the room really couldn't, there was  
**[0:31:44-0:31:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:31:44):**  too much.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:31:45):**  I liked it, but it stays with you for, I think, half an hour after you tasted it.  
**[0:31:49-0:31:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:31:49):**  It stays with you for a while.  
**[0:31:51-0:31:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:31:51):**  But so there's a lot of people who produce these amazing products.  
**[0:31:54-0:31:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:31:54):**  And yes, we're producing for them.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:31:57):**  But there's also a segment, and that's really what we're focusing on, where the large and  
**[0:32:01-0:32:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:32:01):**  medium sized chocolate makers are coming in and they also produce great products, you  
**[0:32:06-0:32:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:32:06):**  know, great dark chocolates, single origin chocolates.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:32:11):**  And they need something else.  
**[0:32:12-0:32:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:32:12):**  They need, let's say, the same interesting flavor profile, but they need a very consistent  
**[0:32:19-0:32:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:32:19):**  quality and the same sort of flavor profile year on year on year.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:32:24):**  Whereas if you're a sort of small manufacturer, well, you buy an amazing harvest from this  
**[0:32:30-0:32:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:32:30):**  one estate.  
**[0:32:31-0:32:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:32:31):**  And if that particular estate doesn't produce the same quality next year, then you buy it  
**[0:32:35-0:32:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:32:35):**  from somewhere else, basically.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:32:36):**  And then your products taste a bit different.  
**[0:32:38-0:32:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:32:38):**  And you can, you know, there's a lot of storytelling and you can explain what you're doing.  
**[0:32:44-0:32:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:32:44):**  If you are, I don't know, one of the big chocolate companies, I don't want to even start naming  
**[0:32:50-0:33:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:32:50):**  them here, then you need very consistent products that, you know, can be sourced from, ideally,  
**[0:33:00-0:33:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:33:00):**  from a single partner such as us.  
**[0:33:02-0:33:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:33:02):**  And the same for investors, I think, because if you're a state owner and one year you're  
**[0:33:05-0:33:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:33:05):**  great and you sell to this amazing bean to bar in Germany company and the next year it's  
**[0:33:11-0:33:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:33:11):**  not great, that just doesn't work for institutional investors because you need the stability also  
**[0:33:16-0:33:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:33:16):**  there.  
**[0:33:17-0:33:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:33:17):**  That's exactly it.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:33:18):**  So you have a lot of different factors.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:33:19):**  And maybe, you know, if you look at the prices in the fine flavor or aromatic cocoa world,  
**[0:33:27-0:33:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:33:27):**  just to give you a reference.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:33:28):**  So let's say the bulk traded cocoa, it trades at two and a half thousand dollars per ton  
**[0:33:36-0:33:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:33:36):**  of cocoa.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:33:37):**  The most sought after cocoa varieties, which may, we have a farm that only produces one  
**[0:33:42-0:33:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:33:42):**  ton maybe a year or so, or a small holder program, you know, that only produces one  
**[0:33:48-0:33:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:33:48):**  ton of cocoa a year, that can sell up to 20, 30,000 dollars for that particular ton.  
**[0:33:54-0:33:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:33:54):**  Wow.  
**[0:33:55-0:34:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:33:55):**  There are people who pay that much and there are some people who pay more than that.  
**[0:34:00-0:34:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:34:00):**  That's not the segment that we're focusing on.  
**[0:34:02-0:34:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:34:02):**  You know, that's like wine where you have these amazing bottles where there's only very  
**[0:34:07-0:34:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:34:07):**  few of them and people pay a fortune for that.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:34:11):**  What we're focusing on is this premium, very aromatic, very quality segment, but that can,  
**[0:34:20-0:34:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:34:20):**  you know, where there's volume to actually turn that into a consistent production line  
**[0:34:25-0:34:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:34:25):**  where you build long lasting partnerships with buyers who are looking exactly for that.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:34:31):**  They give you the quality specifications and the flavor profile that they're after.  
**[0:34:36-0:34:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:34:36):**  And we have the team and the experts to implement that and to maintain it.  
**[0:34:41-0:34:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:34:41):**  And that you cannot expect from, let's say, the small, very passionate farmer who's doing  
**[0:34:47-0:34:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:34:47):**  an amazing job on his few hectares and he'll turn out an amazing product one year and the  
**[0:34:53-0:34:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:34:53):**  next year, well, I don't know, something went wrong in this process.  
**[0:34:57-0:35:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:34:57):**  And so that's the idea with the better forest management is to slowly transition this farm,  
**[0:35:02-0:35:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:35:02):**  but the other ones you've bought or at least for a long time towards this mass and quality.  
**[0:35:07-0:35:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:35:07):**  Doesn't mean you're going to slowly replace the monoculture trees or the, let's say, the  
**[0:35:12-0:35:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:35:12):**  bulk variety that's mainly done this farm so far, mainly has been on this farm so far.  
**[0:35:16-0:35:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:35:16):**  Is that a gradual process that will take over the full landscape?  
**[0:35:20-0:35:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:35:20):**  Well, it's a gradual process, but also you can do a lot with what you have.  
**[0:35:26-0:35:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:35:26):**  I mean, 80%, don't quote me on this, but let's say 80% of the actual flavor actually comes  
**[0:35:33-0:35:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:35:33):**  out in the processing.  
**[0:35:35-0:35:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:35:35):**  Wow.  
**[0:35:36-0:35:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:35:36):**  So after what you were mentioning, some, they were used to be selling it wet and you're  
**[0:35:40-0:35:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:35:40):**  actually processing it on the farm in a consistent way.  
**[0:35:43-0:35:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:35:43):**  So quality matters in the way how you ferment it, how you dry it, you know, how you take  
**[0:35:48-0:35:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:35:48):**  care of it.  
**[0:35:49-0:35:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:35:49):**  And then later how you, what you do with that, how you process it.  
**[0:35:54-0:35:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:35:54):**  That really matters.  
**[0:35:55-0:36:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:35:55):**  So you start with good genetic material, yes, but then the quality kicks in basically.  
**[0:36:01-0:36:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:36:01):**  It comes from the process as with many things.  
**[0:36:06-0:36:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:36:06):**  And so you can still improve even with the, let's say, bulk cocoa quality, you can do  
**[0:36:12-0:36:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:36:12):**  great things, you know, you can improve that.  
**[0:36:15-0:36:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:36:15):**  And there are producers out there who pay for quality also in the bulk market.  
**[0:36:21-0:36:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:36:21):**  And that's what we're aiming for with this farm.  
**[0:36:23-0:36:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:36:23):**  And in terms of monoculture, you mentioned obviously introducing other trees on the cocoa  
**[0:36:28-0:36:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:36:28):**  side of things.  
**[0:36:29-0:36:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:36:29):**  Are you planning to, or already did, introduce other, let's say other crops to make the system  
**[0:36:35-0:36:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:36:35):**  also less drought prone, more complex, et cetera?  
**[0:36:38-0:36:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:36:38):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:36:39-0:36:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:36:39):**  So we are, I mean, it's a process that is currently still undergoing.  
**[0:36:42-0:36:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:36:42):**  So the first thing we did was massively prune everything back, work on the water installation.  
**[0:36:47-0:36:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:36:47):**  And now we built up the nursery and we got all of this in there to, first of all, introduce  
**[0:36:54-0:36:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:36:54):**  shade trees to the cocoa.  
**[0:36:57-0:37:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:36:57):**  So we're planting some gliricidia, which helps fixing nitrogen into the soil.  
**[0:37:07-0:37:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:37:07):**  And we planted a plantain plot, basically, which is for use of the farm workers and their  
**[0:37:16-0:37:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:37:16):**  families.  
**[0:37:17-0:37:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:37:17):**  So we're not necessarily doing that for commercial reasons, that has more of a social aspect  
**[0:37:23-0:37:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:37:23):**  to it.  
**[0:37:25-0:37:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:37:25):**  And the areas that died off, they'll be replanted with a cocoa cover tree model, but focusing  
**[0:37:34-0:37:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:37:34):**  on, as I mentioned, the fine flavor or aromatic varieties which come from that area of Colombia.  
**[0:37:44-0:37:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:37:44):**  For that farm, we're not going to introduce other crops, because it's already a mature  
**[0:37:48-0:37:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:37:48):**  production system as such.  
**[0:37:51-0:37:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:37:51):**  But when it is about time to rejuvenate and replace the trees, then we will completely  
**[0:37:57-0:38:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:37:57):**  revamp the entire production model.  
**[0:38:01-0:38:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:38:01):**  But it's not at this age yet.  
**[0:38:05-0:38:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:38:05):**  So we're trying to maintain it, improve it and work more on the social side of things  
**[0:38:11-0:38:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:38:11):**  for this particular farm.  
**[0:38:13-0:38:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:38:13):**  And these kind of projects, what's the, I wouldn't say life cycle, but what's the horizon  
**[0:38:18-0:38:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:38:18):**  you're thinking at?  
**[0:38:19-0:38:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:38:19):**  Is it 10, 20 years?  
**[0:38:21-0:38:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:38:21):**  How long do you plan to be owners of a plantation like that?  
**[0:38:25-0:38:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:38:25):**  And thus, how many cycles can you do?  
**[0:38:28-0:38:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:38:28):**  Or how long can you actually think and plan when it comes to, in this case, this farm,  
**[0:38:32-0:38:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:38:32):**  but let's say the farms in general?  
**[0:38:33-0:38:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:38:33):**  Yeah, well, there's a bit of dispute around that.  
**[0:38:36-0:38:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:38:36):**  But we can certainly say that a well-maintained cocoa plant can produce at high levels for  
**[0:38:47-0:38:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:38:47):**  30 years, possibly longer, up to 50 years.  
**[0:38:52-0:39:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:38:52):**  And if you rejuvenate it well and you maintain it well, then that could be much, much longer.  
**[0:39:02-0:39:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:39:02):**  But we'll probably replace it after 30 years.  
**[0:39:08-0:39:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:39:08):**  Since February 2019, more than 40 people from all over the world have joined our Patreon

**[0:39:29-0:39:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:39:29):**  agriculture, or in the link below.  
**[0:39:32-0:39:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:39:32):**  And you as an investor, what's your horizon as a fund, as the asset manager?  
**[0:39:36-0:39:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:39:36):**  Well, it depends what your objective is.  
**[0:39:38-0:39:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:39:38):**  So I mean, basically, once you've made planting cocoa is quite capital intensive, in particular,  
**[0:39:45-0:39:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:39:45):**  if you do it like we do it with irrigation and a lot of sort of mechanization as well,  
**[0:39:56-0:40:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:39:56):**  to focus on the quality, as I said, then that comes at a considerable cost.  
**[0:40:02-0:40:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:40:02):**  So you could say that a hectare of cocoa development will cost you, let's say, $12,000 to $15,000.  
**[0:40:12-0:40:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:40:12):**  Now, most of that investment happens upfront in the first two years or so.  
**[0:40:18-0:40:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:40:18):**  So once you've made that investment, then you have a productive system after three,  
**[0:40:23-0:40:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:40:23):**  four years, the cocoa starts producing.  
**[0:40:26-0:40:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:40:26):**  And then if you maintain it well, it will yield for, let's say, another 25 years or  
**[0:40:31-0:40:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:40:31):**  so, at least.  
**[0:40:33-0:40:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:40:33):**  So you can stay in there and that's going to be profitable and attractive.  
**[0:40:38-0:40:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:40:38):**  But there's also a market of buyers who are looking to invest in established, sustainable,  
**[0:40:48-0:40:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:40:48):**  high yielding production systems.  
**[0:40:51-0:40:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:40:51):**  And there aren't that many out there.  
**[0:40:53-0:40:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:40:53):**  There are a few and some of them we bought and others we decided against.  
**[0:40:58-0:41:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:40:58):**  But generally speaking, the cocoa market is still a very medieval kind of market dominated  
**[0:41:07-0:41:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:41:07):**  by small producers who are working on two, three hectares of land.  
**[0:41:12-0:41:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:41:12):**  So you have six million small farmers and very few processors who actually buy the products.  
**[0:41:19-0:41:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:41:19):**  So very unjust market.  
**[0:41:23-0:41:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:41:23):**  But that's not the topic here.  
**[0:41:25-0:41:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:41:25):**  That's for another podcast.  
**[0:41:26-0:41:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:41:26):**  For another podcast.  
**[0:41:27-0:41:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:41:27):**  Yes.  
**[0:41:28-0:41:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:41:28):**  I'm making a list of follow up ones.  
**[0:41:29-0:41:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:41:29):**  Definitely let me know in the comments below.  
**[0:41:31-0:41:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:41:31):**  Should we do another one on a deep dive into cocoa on the unjustness?  
**[0:41:35-0:41:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:41:35):**  I think it's extremely interesting.  
**[0:41:37-0:41:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:41:37):**  But let's keep that for another time.  
**[0:41:39-0:41:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:41:39):**  So what I wanted to talk about here more is more you could either seek an exit.  
**[0:41:46-0:41:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:41:46):**  So typically you have either investors who like to develop new projects, you know, be  
**[0:41:51-0:41:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:41:51):**  it in real estate, be it in agriculture, whatever.  
**[0:41:54-0:41:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:41:54):**  Or renewable energy, because it sounds very similar to where the market was, I think,  
**[0:41:59-0:42:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:41:59):**  a number of years ago.  
**[0:42:01-0:42:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:42:01):**  You build these projects, a solar farm, wind farm, etc.  
**[0:42:05-0:42:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:42:05):**  You build them and hold them for a long time.  
**[0:42:07-0:42:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:42:07):**  That could be your model.  
**[0:42:08-0:42:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:42:08):**  Or you build and sell once they're up and running and the big risk is done.  
**[0:42:11-0:42:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:42:11):**  And you might sell them actually, too.  
**[0:42:13-0:42:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:42:13):**  We come back to that the institutional investors either things that want assets that are yielding  
**[0:42:18-0:42:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:42:18):**  over a long 25 year period.  
**[0:42:21-0:42:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:42:21):**  Obviously ag is different than energy and but different in real estate as well.  
**[0:42:26-0:42:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:42:26):**  But it's very similar, I think, in terms of mechanics.  
**[0:42:28-0:42:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:42:28):**  Well, I think the mechanics you're describing it very well.  
**[0:42:32-0:42:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:42:32):**  I think the mechanics of investment are the same in all these real assets projects.  
**[0:42:37-0:42:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:42:37):**  You know, you have someone who takes a developer risk and that person expects to be remunerated  
**[0:42:45-0:42:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:42:45):**  for that risk basically to achieve a premium.  
**[0:42:49-0:42:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:42:49):**  And very few sort of develop from scratch and then I stay in there for 20, 30 years.  
**[0:42:54-0:43:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:42:54):**  I think most, at least from an investor point of view, they do that.  
**[0:43:00-0:43:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:43:00):**  They expect that premium and they seek an exit after a number of years.  
**[0:43:04-0:43:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:43:04):**  And in our space, we identified sort of five to seven years as a good time to exit and  
**[0:43:10-0:43:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:43:10):**  to maximize value basically once you have a fully productive system there.  
**[0:43:15-0:43:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:43:15):**  But then there are others who don't want that kind of profile.  
**[0:43:19-0:43:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:43:19):**  They're more, let's say, annuity oriented.  
**[0:43:23-0:43:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:43:23):**  So they're maybe not looking for the high returns or the very high returns that a development  
**[0:43:30-0:43:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:43:30):**  premium would give you.  
**[0:43:32-0:43:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:43:32):**  They're more looking for stable returns, dividend payout every year.  
**[0:43:38-0:43:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:43:38):**  And that is what a farm gives you.  
**[0:43:40-0:43:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:43:40):**  If you have a stable farm that is well maintained using the best technology and monitoring out  
**[0:43:49-0:43:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:43:49):**  there, having good processes, then you have a very stable production system.  
**[0:43:54-0:43:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:43:54):**  Now, if you pair that with a good offtake agreement that gives you stability on the  
**[0:43:58-0:44:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:43:58):**  price, then you have a fairly de-risked investment.  
**[0:44:03-0:44:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:44:03):**  So if you buy such a farm or invest in such a farm, then that gives you an annual return.  
**[0:44:10-0:44:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:44:10):**  That is, well, it's obviously not the same.  
**[0:44:12-0:44:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:44:12):**  I mean, we are still in agriculture and there's weather and things such as that.  
**[0:44:17-0:44:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:44:17):**  But generally speaking, you have something that is relatively predictable.  
**[0:44:22-0:44:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:44:22):**  And that is something that many investors are looking for.  
**[0:44:29-0:44:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:44:29):**  And that would be the typical market for the developer to basically sell a fully functioning,  
**[0:44:35-0:44:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:44:35):**  well maintained and productive system to someone who is more interested in that second part  
**[0:44:40-0:44:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:44:40):**  of the cash flow.  
**[0:44:41-0:44:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:44:41):**  And the German pension fund, your large investor, with them, are you more on the develop and  
**[0:44:48-0:44:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:44:48):**  sell or the develop and hold model?  
**[0:44:51-0:44:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:44:51):**  If you can share that.  
**[0:44:53-0:44:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:44:53):**  We do both.  
**[0:44:54-0:45:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:44:54):**  That's maybe not a very satisfactory answer, but it's fair enough.  
**[0:45:00-0:45:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:45:00):**  It's a mix the risk and the return.  
**[0:45:02-0:45:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:45:02):**  Basically.  
**[0:45:03-0:45:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:45:03):**  And what kind of return targets are you in generally focusing on?  
**[0:45:06-0:45:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:45:06):**  Because I think it's something we talked in the pre-conversation.  
**[0:45:09-0:45:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:45:09):**  Is that for a lot of people, it's difficult to imagine you can have, quote unquote, good  
**[0:45:15-0:45:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:45:15):**  returns in a sustainable way or in a regenerative way, both in the social and obviously on the  
**[0:45:21-0:45:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:45:21):**  environmental side of things.  
**[0:45:22-0:45:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:45:22):**  So just to have to return question out of the hand, because if I don't ask it, I'm sure  
**[0:45:26-0:45:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:45:26):**  I'm going to get some comments.  
**[0:45:29-0:45:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:45:29):**  What kind of returns in a well managed and we're going to get to the reforestation site  
**[0:45:32-0:45:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:45:32):**  later.  
**[0:45:33-0:45:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:45:33):**  Let's say on the well managed or good well managed forest, farm, agroforestry system.  
**[0:45:40-0:45:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:45:40):**  What kind of returns in the cocoa market, obviously, depending on weather, et cetera,  
**[0:45:44-0:45:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:45:44):**  et cetera.  
**[0:45:45-0:45:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:45:45):**  What kind of return should we think about or consider?  
**[0:45:48-0:45:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:45:48):**  OK, sure.  
**[0:45:49-0:45:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:45:49):**  Well, first of all, let me say the question of profit is not a dirty one.  
**[0:45:55-0:46:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:45:55):**  It's not something that people should be ashamed of when talking about sustainable land use.  
**[0:46:03-0:46:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:46:03):**  I think part of sustainability is also that you have a viable business that generates  
**[0:46:08-0:46:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:46:08):**  a profit that can pay good salaries for its workers and that doesn't rely on on grounds  
**[0:46:15-0:46:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:46:15):**  or such on donors, basically, because that will not change the world.  
**[0:46:19-0:46:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:46:19):**  You know, you need profitable farming if you want to convince trillions of assets to be  
**[0:46:27-0:46:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:46:27):**  moved into the space.  
**[0:46:29-0:46:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:46:29):**  And that is the objective, I guess, because agriculture needs to change and it doesn't  
**[0:46:33-0:46:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:46:33):**  only need to change in small cocoa farms, it needs to change on the massive scale and  
**[0:46:38-0:46:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:46:38):**  everywhere.  
**[0:46:40-0:46:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:46:40):**  And so we believe that we need to demonstrate that sustainable farming practices are profitable.  
**[0:46:51-0:46:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:46:51):**  And so the investor answer or the right answer to your question would be, it's always a question  
**[0:46:58-0:47:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:46:58):**  of return and risk.  
**[0:47:01-0:47:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:47:01):**  So you have to you have to look at that not in isolation.  
**[0:47:06-0:47:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:47:06):**  So a typical return and that obviously depends on the crop.  
**[0:47:09-0:47:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:47:09):**  So we don't only produce cocoa.  
**[0:47:12-0:47:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:47:12):**  We also, for example, have one of the largest coconut plantations in the world now, which  
**[0:47:21-0:47:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:47:21):**  we're currently rehabilitating.  
**[0:47:23-0:47:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:47:23):**  So there are a lot of different markets that we are in and so there's also different different  
**[0:47:28-0:47:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:47:28):**  properties.  
**[0:47:29-0:47:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:47:29):**  And so let's say if you develop a new system, you can expect a return, which is largely  
**[0:47:37-0:47:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:47:37):**  exit driven because the first years you don't have production yet.  
**[0:47:42-0:47:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:47:42):**  You can have a return of, let's say, 12 to 20 percent.  
**[0:47:47-0:47:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:47:47):**  It could even be more.  
**[0:47:48-0:47:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:47:48):**  So that's really the build, build from scratch and exit.  
**[0:47:53-0:47:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:47:53):**  When you hold it, when you buy it, let's say I'm the buyer of that exit and I'm on the  
**[0:47:57-0:48:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:47:57):**  other side and then you hold it for, let's say, 25 years.  
**[0:48:01-0:48:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:48:01):**  So if you hold it, then in that space, you probably have a net investor return of six,  
**[0:48:07-0:48:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:48:07):**  eight, up to 10 percent.  
**[0:48:09-0:48:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:48:09):**  It depends how you produce, where you produce, what you produce.  
**[0:48:12-0:48:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:48:12):**  But sounds very similar to the renewable energy space a few years ago.  
**[0:48:16-0:48:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:48:16):**  I think now it's depending on where you are, as this as well, on your crop, your sunshine  
**[0:48:21-0:48:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:48:21):**  and wind.  
**[0:48:22-0:48:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:48:22):**  But it sounds very similar to those type of returns.  
**[0:48:25-0:48:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:48:25):**  Very interesting.  
**[0:48:26-0:48:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:48:26):**  No, it is.  
**[0:48:27-0:48:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:48:27):**  I think it is quite comparable, to be honest.  
**[0:48:29-0:48:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:48:29):**  And the risks may be different and the market is obviously different because in the renewable  
**[0:48:34-0:48:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:48:34):**  space, at least you got, you know, well, first of all, you got subsidies, which you don't  
**[0:48:38-0:48:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:48:38):**  really have here that much, at least not in the countries where we are active.  
**[0:48:43-0:48:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:48:43):**  But they're risky as well.  
**[0:48:44-0:48:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:48:44):**  They can change overnight, as many renewable energy investors in Spain found out where  
**[0:48:48-0:48:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:48:48):**  they retrospectively changed.  
**[0:48:50-0:48:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:48:50):**  But there are still lawsuits being filed over that.  
**[0:48:52-0:48:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:48:52):**  So it's I mean, I think the weather risk and the subsidy risk maybe are quite comparable.  
**[0:48:56-0:48:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:48:56):**  Yeah, no, that's true.  
**[0:48:58-0:49:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:48:58):**  OK, so but that gives you an indication of how this looks like.  
**[0:49:02-0:49:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:49:02):**  So the good thing is obviously if you have annual dividend distributions of five, six,  
**[0:49:08-0:49:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:49:08):**  seven percent and you are a pension fund or an insurer or an asset manager with certain  
**[0:49:16-0:49:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:49:16):**  return objectives, then this may be just the thing for you to buy yourself into an established  
**[0:49:23-0:49:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:49:23):**  or converted farm portfolio.  
**[0:49:25-0:49:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:49:25):**  And you have massive non-financial returns.  
**[0:49:27-0:49:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:49:27):**  I think the impact returns and I mean, the amount of carbon being stored, the amount  
**[0:49:31-0:49:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:49:31):**  of work you provide or projects like this provide and obviously the amount of food.  
**[0:49:37-0:49:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:49:37):**  And you can discuss if cocoa, just like wine, that's an absolute necessity in terms of food.  
**[0:49:41-0:49:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:49:41):**  But it's another I think coconut oil already becomes a different product there.  
**[0:49:45-0:49:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:49:45):**  But it's something we consume in large, large quantities and most of it is produced in a  
**[0:49:50-0:49:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:49:50):**  very extractive way.  
**[0:49:51-0:49:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:49:51):**  So replacing that with this providing a huge change on the non-financial return side.  
**[0:49:57-0:49:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:49:57):**  No, no, I fully agree.  
**[0:49:59-0:50:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:49:59):**  I mean, first of all, all our product, all our projects are, let's say, net carbon positive,  
**[0:50:06-0:50:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:50:06):**  which is not a given in agriculture, of course.  
**[0:50:11-0:50:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:50:11):**  Secondly, you made the point that, yes, obviously, fine flavor chocolate is a luxury product.  
**[0:50:21-0:50:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:50:21):**  It's not a staple food.  
**[0:50:23-0:50:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:50:23):**  We're aware of that.  
**[0:50:24-0:50:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:50:24):**  But that's the great thing about agroforest.  
**[0:50:27-0:50:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:50:27):**  If you combine different components, and we do that in other projects than the one I described,  
**[0:50:34-0:50:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:50:34):**  then you can do both.  
**[0:50:38-0:50:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:50:38):**  You can produce staple foods for the local market, be it plantain, be it peas, be it  
**[0:50:45-0:50:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:50:45):**  corn.  
**[0:50:49-0:50:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:50:49):**  And you can combine that with luxury products that pay a premium and generate a higher income,  
**[0:50:56-0:51:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:50:56):**  be it coffee, be it cocoa, be it rubber, trees.  
**[0:51:02-0:51:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:51:02):**  What else do we produce?  
**[0:51:03-0:51:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:51:03):**  We produce carchole, coconut oil, many other things, you know, and it's that combination  
**[0:51:09-0:51:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:51:09):**  that makes it so attractive because you can actually produce more and maybe also more  
**[0:51:14-0:51:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:51:14):**  meaningful with less on the same piece of land.  
**[0:51:19-0:51:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:51:19):**  That's the core of agriculture that has to change.  
**[0:51:20-0:51:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:51:20):**  And I think also in the mind of people, it is possible to layer, it is possible to produce  
**[0:51:25-0:51:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:51:25):**  a lot more.  
**[0:51:27-0:51:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:51:27):**  And the current, let's say, production numbers and yields we see in any crop are by definition  
**[0:51:32-0:51:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:51:32):**  not the ultimate.  
**[0:51:34-0:51:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:51:34):**  There's a lot more beyond that.  
**[0:51:36-0:51:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:51:36):**  And we see now examples in many, many different crops where people in a regenerative way,  
**[0:51:40-0:51:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:51:40):**  or at least a sustainable way, getting a lot more yield of different crops, have a more  
**[0:51:45-0:51:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:51:45):**  complex system of the same piece of land.  
**[0:51:47-0:51:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:51:47):**  And I think that's something that's very, as long as we don't see that, that at least  
**[0:51:51-0:51:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:51:51):**  there's the opportunity or the possibility of that, it's very difficult to sell, between  
**[0:51:56-0:52:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:51:56):**  brackets, sustainable agriculture, regenerative agriculture to investors, because if they  
**[0:52:00-0:52:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:52:00):**  don't believe that it's possible to go beyond monoculture cornfield, which they think is  
**[0:52:04-0:52:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:52:04):**  the most productive thing ever, then it's very difficult to get in between their ears  
**[0:52:08-0:52:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:52:08):**  that there's something beyond that, or there are many opportunities beyond.  
**[0:52:12-0:52:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:52:12):**  But this is a great bridge to the reforestation example you were mentioning before.  
**[0:52:17-0:52:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:52:17):**  Can you paint a picture of what happens if you really start from scratch?  
**[0:52:21-0:52:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:52:21):**  Yeah, okay.  
**[0:52:23-0:52:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:52:23):**  So I'll give you another example.  
**[0:52:25-0:52:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:52:25):**  I mean, we also have projects that focus on pure forestry, you know, where it's not about  
**[0:52:30-0:52:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:52:30):**  producing a crop or anything like that.  
**[0:52:33-0:52:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:52:33):**  But I wanted to give you another example, which I think is a real showcase for how to  
**[0:52:38-0:52:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:52:38):**  bring degraded areas back into production and make them meaningful again.  
**[0:52:44-0:52:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:52:44):**  So this is a project, Hacienda Ambrosia, which is in the Dominican Republic, in the north  
**[0:52:49-0:52:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:52:49):**  of the Dominican Republic.  
**[0:52:50-0:52:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:52:50):**  I just came back from there.  
**[0:52:53-0:52:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:52:53):**  And what this is, is basically a degraded coconut plantation.  
**[0:52:59-0:53:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:52:59):**  So someone assembled 30 years ago and planted and combined coconut production, and it wasn't  
**[0:53:10-0:53:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:53:10):**  a fashionable product at the time.  
**[0:53:12-0:53:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:53:12):**  So nowadays, coconut oil, everyone knows it has got health benefits, and it's turned into  
**[0:53:19-0:53:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:53:19):**  a superfood.  
**[0:53:21-0:53:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:53:21):**  At the time, that was just a cheap source of fat, basically.  
**[0:53:26-0:53:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:53:26):**  So that farm was developed.  
**[0:53:30-0:53:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:53:30):**  The market didn't turn out to be very attractive, and the owners more or less let it degrade  
**[0:53:37-0:53:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:53:37):**  because it wasn't worth continuing to produce.  
**[0:53:40-0:53:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:53:40):**  So that coconut plantation was forgotten, and we found it when we were land scouting  
**[0:53:47-0:53:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:53:47):**  in the Dominican Republic.  
**[0:53:48-0:53:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:53:48):**  What do you mean, forgotten?  
**[0:53:50-0:53:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:53:50):**  Like people just forgot about that it existed?  
**[0:53:53-0:54:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:53:53):**  Well, the market wasn't attractive, so it wasn't worth farming it in a sort of intensive  
**[0:54:01-0:54:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:54:01):**  way.  
**[0:54:02-0:54:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:54:02):**  And it didn't make sense to change it to another product?  
**[0:54:04-0:54:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:54:04):**  Yeah, it didn't make sense to change it.  
**[0:54:07-0:54:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:54:07):**  It's quite remote in that sense.  
**[0:54:09-0:54:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:54:09):**  So road access wasn't good at the time.  
**[0:54:11-0:54:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:54:11):**  It's improved since.  
**[0:54:13-0:54:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:54:13):**  But it wasn't easy to get to that.  
**[0:54:16-0:54:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:54:16):**  And so they had other investments that they were looking at that were more promising,  
**[0:54:20-0:54:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:54:20):**  and they didn't forget about it, but they didn't do anything with it, basically.  
**[0:54:24-0:54:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:54:24):**  So it overgrew.  
**[0:54:26-0:54:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:54:26):**  It's situated beautifully at the end of a valley nestled into the hills adjacent to  
**[0:54:33-0:54:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:54:33):**  a research reserve.  
**[0:54:38-0:54:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:54:38):**  There's a lot of water coming down the hills, basically.  
**[0:54:41-0:54:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:54:41):**  So you have to imagine this beautiful forest area with coconut palms and with 12 riverlets,  
**[0:54:49-0:54:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:54:49):**  12 streams crossing the farm, water rushing down.  
**[0:54:53-0:54:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:54:53):**  It's raining a lot there.  
**[0:54:55-0:54:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:54:55):**  So it's beautifully situated, but it's remote.  
**[0:54:58-0:55:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:54:58):**  There aren't many people there.  
**[0:55:00-0:55:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:55:00):**  And it just wasn't worth developing it from their point of view, I think.  
**[0:55:06-0:55:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:55:06):**  So we were looking for an interesting area to be used for developing a cacao plantation,  
**[0:55:16-0:55:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:55:16):**  cocoa plantation.  
**[0:55:17-0:55:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:55:17):**  And we talked a lot about that already.  
**[0:55:19-0:55:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:55:19):**  So let me talk about something differently, maybe a little bit.  
**[0:55:24-0:55:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:55:24):**  But that was the objective.  
**[0:55:26-0:55:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:55:26):**  And we were told that this exists.  
**[0:55:29-0:55:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:55:29):**  We looked at it, and we looked at the palms, and they were not really producing anymore.  
**[0:55:35-0:55:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:55:35):**  And we thought, OK, well, what are we going to do?  
**[0:55:38-0:55:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:55:38):**  So we brought in some coconut experts, because we weren't.  
**[0:55:43-0:55:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:55:43):**  And it was interesting, because they said, well, listen, despite these palms being 30  
**[0:55:48-0:55:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:55:48):**  years old, they have the potential to be brought back into production.  
**[0:55:53-0:55:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:55:53):**  You need to get rid of some pests.  
**[0:55:57-0:56:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:55:57):**  You need to get rid of some diseases.  
**[0:56:02-0:56:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:56:02):**  So generally speaking, they are in good shape.  
**[0:56:07-0:56:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:56:07):**  But they've never been fertilized.  
**[0:56:08-0:56:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:56:08):**  They've never been really treated for anything.  
**[0:56:12-0:56:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:56:12):**  And that's what we started doing.  
**[0:56:14-0:56:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:56:14):**  And so we are actually bringing something that stopped producing back into full production.  
**[0:56:21-0:56:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:56:21):**  And they will not last forever.  
**[0:56:23-0:56:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:56:23):**  We need to replace the palms gradually with new palms, different varieties also, to an  
**[0:56:32-0:56:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:56:32):**  extent.  
**[0:56:33-0:56:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:56:33):**  And we'll plant an extensive cocoa system underneath.  
**[0:56:38-0:56:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:56:38):**  Maybe I say cacao here, because cocoa and cacao is very confusing sometimes.  
**[0:56:44-0:56:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:56:44):**  So this will be the largest, I can say that already, the largest cacao and coconut production  
**[0:56:51-0:56:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:56:51):**  system in the world.  
**[0:56:52-0:56:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:56:52):**  It is already organic certified.  
**[0:56:54-0:56:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:56:54):**  That was easy to prove that nothing happened.  
**[0:56:57-0:56:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:56:57):**  For the last 30 years, yeah.  
**[0:56:58-0:57:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:56:58):**  For the last 30 years there, that was very easy to prove.  
**[0:57:02-0:57:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:57:02):**  So that already happened.  
**[0:57:04-0:57:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:57:04):**  And we started developing this project this year.  
**[0:57:06-0:57:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:57:06):**  It's a massive effort, clearing the whole undergrowth, treating the palms.  
**[0:57:13-0:57:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:57:13):**  We already employed 190 people, which is a massive thing for that remote area.  
**[0:57:21-0:57:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:57:21):**  So people are coming there to work there from quite a distance.  
**[0:57:26-0:57:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:57:26):**  The second phase then we'll see, which is starting now, see the development of the cacao  
**[0:57:32-0:57:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:57:32):**  system underneath the palms.  
**[0:57:35-0:57:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:57:35):**  It's not only that.  
**[0:57:36-0:57:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:57:36):**  We introduced apiculture.  
**[0:57:38-0:57:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:57:38):**  So we're going to have 60 million bees on this farm.  
**[0:57:43-0:57:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:57:43):**  It's huge.  
**[0:57:44-0:57:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:57:44):**  It's more than 2,000 hectares.  
**[0:57:45-0:57:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:57:45):**  Half of it is forest.  
**[0:57:48-0:57:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:57:48):**  And then the third phase will be the processing.  
**[0:57:50-0:57:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:57:50):**  So we'll focus on producing coconut oil, virgin coconut oil, which is a very attractive product,  
**[0:57:58-0:58:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:57:58):**  coconut sugar, coconut water, of course, then the cacao itself producing honey.  
**[0:58:05-0:58:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:58:05):**  And we'll do that with the partners that we found and who are already doing that to an  
**[0:58:11-0:58:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:58:11):**  extent in the Dominican Republic.  
**[0:58:14-0:58:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:58:14):**  We do that exclusively with single mothers.  
**[0:58:17-0:58:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:58:17):**  So that is a key social objective to provide work opportunity for single mothers who do  
**[0:58:25-0:58:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:58:25):**  not have any support system in the Dominican Republic.  
**[0:58:29-0:58:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:58:29):**  There's very little chance for them to enter the formal work market or employment market,  
**[0:58:35-0:58:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:58:35):**  and particularly in this sort of remote rural area where there isn't much.  
**[0:58:40-0:58:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:58:40):**  And so that will be a real game changer.  
**[0:58:44-0:58:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:58:44):**  And the partners that we're working with, they've already done this in the past, the  
**[0:58:48-0:58:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:58:48):**  small scale.  
**[0:58:50-0:58:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:58:50):**  And together we're basically developing this.  
**[0:58:53-0:58:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:58:53):**  So it's a whole value chain with so many facets, which are great.  
**[0:58:59-0:59:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:58:59):**  So it's an amazing project.  
**[0:59:01-0:59:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:59:01):**  And as I said, we have 12 projects, and each of them has a unique angle and something really  
**[0:59:08-0:59:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:59:08):**  special about it.  
**[0:59:09-0:59:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:59:09):**  Be it a different product, be it in a country like, I don't know, like Guatemala, which  
**[0:59:15-0:59:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:59:15):**  is very different in terms of culture than some of the other countries that we're working  
**[0:59:22-0:59:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:59:22):**  in.  
**[0:59:23-0:59:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:59:23):**  So that's what makes it so interesting.  
**[0:59:26-0:59:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:59:26):**  And maybe just let me say three words on that portfolio part, just because I touched upon  
**[0:59:33-0:59:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:59:33):**  it.  
**[0:59:34-0:59:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:59:34):**  There's real value in having a portfolio of different but similar types of projects.  
**[0:59:41-0:59:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:59:41):**  So we're working a lot on creating a farm manager exchange, real partnership where people  
**[0:59:50-0:59:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:59:50):**  openly discuss problems that they face in the farm, and to learn from each other.  
**[0:59:56-1:00:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=0:59:56):**  So we're in that sense, our main objective is also to be a platform, and in this case,  
**[1:00:01-1:00:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:00:01):**  a knowledge exchange platform, where we enable dialogue between, let's say, a farm manager  
**[1:00:08-1:00:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:00:08):**  in Colombia, let's say the project Macancala I talked about, Adriana, to talk to the farm  
**[1:00:17-1:00:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:00:17):**  managers in the Dominican Republic, Daniel and Mario, and to exchange issues that they  
**[1:00:23-1:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:00:23):**  face, problems that they encounter.  
**[1:00:26-1:00:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:00:26):**  And to visit and see.  
**[1:00:27-1:00:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:00:27):**  To visit, to learn also.  
**[1:00:30-1:00:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:00:30):**  Obviously, these people have all done something different with other companies before, so  
**[1:00:35-1:00:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:00:35):**  they bring expertise, which may be useful to other farms that have a specific problem  
**[1:00:41-1:00:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:00:41):**  or something.  
**[1:00:43-1:00:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:00:43):**  So that is a very valuable component in a portfolio, apart from the obvious diversification  
**[1:00:50-1:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:00:50):**  and risk management aspects that a portfolio brings.  
**[1:00:54-1:00:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:00:54):**  And where are you going next?  
**[1:00:56-1:01:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:00:56):**  Obviously, you're going to do a lot more in cacao, coffee, coconut.  
**[1:01:02-1:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:01:02):**  What are, from a portfolio perspective, but also from a company perspective, what are  
**[1:01:06-1:01:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:01:06):**  other crops within large agroforestry systems that you would like to, or are already working  
**[1:01:12-1:01:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:01:12):**  on to expand that portfolio and basically invest more of that committed money that obviously  
**[1:01:17-1:01:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:01:17):**  needs to be put to work?  
**[1:01:19-1:01:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:01:19):**  Yes.  
**[1:01:20-1:01:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:01:20):**  No pressure.  
**[1:01:21-1:01:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:01:21):**  And to find new money, of course, as well.  
**[1:01:24-1:01:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:01:24):**  Okay, a couple of questions.  
**[1:01:27-1:01:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:01:27):**  But okay, so first, with the established projects, we are entering a new phase now.  
**[1:01:33-1:01:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:01:33):**  As I said, we have invested in seven countries in 12 projects.  
**[1:01:38-1:01:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:01:38):**  And now our objective is twofold.  
**[1:01:41-1:01:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:01:41):**  One is to expand, to create economies of scale.  
**[1:01:47-1:01:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:01:47):**  We have set up management teams, companies and so on, and we want to leverage that, optimize  
**[1:01:53-1:01:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:01:53):**  that.  
**[1:01:55-1:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:01:55):**  But the second aspect is to introduce the smallholder and also reforestation work that  
**[1:02:07-1:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:02:07):**  maybe has not so much of a profit objective, and which is very much part of our value proposition.  
**[1:02:13-1:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:02:13):**  So what we develop are typically what we call nucleus plasma models.  
**[1:02:18-1:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:02:18):**  So we build large nucleus farms, but then we surround them with smallholder activity  
**[1:02:25-1:02:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:02:25):**  and technical assistance programs that allow the surrounding communities to benefit from  
**[1:02:33-1:02:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:02:33):**  what the farm is doing, providing planting material, knowledge, technology, access to  
**[1:02:41-1:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:02:41):**  capital, but also access to world markets.  
**[1:02:44-1:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:02:44):**  So we buy the product at good prices from them.  
**[1:02:49-1:02:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:02:49):**  And that is the objective at each farm.  
**[1:02:52-1:02:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:02:52):**  But phase one was to find and build these farms.  
**[1:02:57-1:02:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:02:57):**  Phase two is to surround them, basically.  
**[1:02:59-1:03:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:02:59):**  And then the long term work of working on biodiversity, working on changing the social  
**[1:03:07-1:03:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:03:07):**  mesh in the rural landscape, that is something obviously that doesn't change overnight.  
**[1:03:12-1:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:03:12):**  It's something that we need to work on for decades.  
**[1:03:17-1:03:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:03:17):**  When it comes to new crops, we already started looking beyond tropical agriculture, if you  
**[1:03:26-1:03:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:03:26):**  want so.  
**[1:03:27-1:03:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:03:27):**  So what I talked about so far was mostly tropical crops, such as cacao, coffee, rubber, and  
**[1:03:37-1:03:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:03:37):**  bananas, plantains, all the good things that we produce.  
**[1:03:41-1:03:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:03:41):**  Now, I also just came back from Morocco, where we're starting a new project in the desert  
**[1:03:50-1:03:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:03:50):**  almost, which is going to develop, which is going to produce dates.  
**[1:03:57-1:04:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:03:57):**  So it's a date palm system.  
**[1:04:01-1:04:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:04:01):**  And there obviously we have very different challenges.  
**[1:04:04-1:04:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:04:04):**  It's very much about efficiency of water usage, as we are in a very arid environment there.  
**[1:04:14-1:04:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:04:14):**  And it's basically the first stepping stone into developing a portfolio in the dry fruits  
**[1:04:20-1:04:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:04:20):**  and nuts area, which we think is very promising.  
**[1:04:25-1:04:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:04:25):**  So the dates that we are going to produce, it's a very profitable market, actually.  
**[1:04:32-1:04:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:04:32):**  It's a very interesting product.  
**[1:04:36-1:04:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:04:36):**  We're going to be the only organic dates producer in Morocco at this scale.  
**[1:04:41-1:04:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:04:41):**  And we're planning to diversify that also into other dry fruits and nut production,  
**[1:04:52-1:04:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:04:52):**  basically, be it almonds, be it pistachios.  
**[1:04:55-1:04:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:04:55):**  There's a lot of interesting models out there.  
**[1:04:58-1:05:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:04:58):**  And that is something that we're very actively pursuing at the moment.  
**[1:05:01-1:05:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:05:01):**  And then obviously, we want to do more.  
**[1:05:04-1:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:05:04):**  We see a lot of potential in what I always call the climate action dialogues.  
**[1:05:12-1:05:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:05:12):**  I think that the Paris Accord has really enabled a dialogue with large corporates.  
**[1:05:25-1:05:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:05:25):**  We see a lot of large corporates who are signing up to or committing to climate action.  
**[1:05:33-1:05:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:05:33):**  But I'm convinced they don't really know yet what that means, other than obviously, changing  
**[1:05:38-1:05:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:05:38):**  the whole supply chain, the way they do business.  
**[1:05:42-1:05:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:05:42):**  And we see a lot of demand for high conservation value projects, for carbon forestry.  
**[1:05:49-1:05:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:05:49):**  A lot of companies, as you know, the carbon markets have seen a renaissance.  
**[1:05:57-1:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:05:57):**  Many companies seek to compensate their carbon emissions.  
**[1:06:03-1:06:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:06:03):**  So in that space, we have something to offer.  
**[1:06:08-1:06:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:06:08):**  And that is something that we're currently developing.  
**[1:06:12-1:06:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:06:12):**  And on the other side, you see a lot of, well, I mentioned the confectionery makers, but  
**[1:06:19-1:06:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:06:19):**  also other groups, corporate groups who are seeking to secure, directly secure their supply  
**[1:06:26-1:06:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:06:26):**  chain.  
**[1:06:28-1:06:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:06:28):**  And we're working on partnerships, direct partnerships to create new sustainable production  
**[1:06:35-1:06:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:06:35):**  together with these corporates.  
**[1:06:38-1:06:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:06:38):**  So they are willing not only to buy product, but to do more than that, to become invested  
**[1:06:44-1:06:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:06:44):**  in a partner.  
**[1:06:46-1:06:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:06:46):**  And that is something we see more and more and that we want to develop.  
**[1:06:50-1:06:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:06:50):**  And then of course, beyond that, to find more institutional investors to fund these kinds  
**[1:06:55-1:07:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:06:55):**  of projects and to co-invest with those partners that we bring together.  
**[1:07:00-1:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:07:00):**  So it's quite an ambitious agenda, but it's obviously also a lot of fun.  
**[1:07:05-1:07:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:07:05):**  And that's what we're currently working on.  
**[1:07:07-1:07:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:07:07):**  And definitely very necessary.  
**[1:07:09-1:07:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:07:09):**  I think that I normally always ask, or in the last number of episodes, ask a question,  
**[1:07:14-1:07:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:07:14):**  what would you do if you're in charge of a big portfolio?  
**[1:07:17-1:07:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:07:17):**  Why ask the question?  
**[1:07:18-1:07:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:07:18):**  Because I think the sector needs to be getting ready to deal with larger numbers and more  
**[1:07:24-1:07:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:07:24):**  zeros and be ready for large investors to be active in the space that, like you said,  
**[1:07:29-1:07:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:07:29):**  want to put 50 million or a hundred million or 200 million to work.  
**[1:07:33-1:07:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:07:33):**  But in this case, I think you are managing a large portfolio and obviously not as large  
**[1:07:37-1:07:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:07:37):**  as you want to, but you have the experience of dealing with larger numbers.  
**[1:07:41-1:07:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:07:41):**  So I don't think that question is too relevant.  
**[1:07:44-1:07:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:07:44):**  But I would like to ask if you could change one thing in the agriculture and food sector,  
**[1:07:49-1:07:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:07:49):**  including the forestry, including the say land use overnight.  
**[1:07:52-1:07:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:07:52):**  If you could wave a magic wand and tomorrow morning we wake up and all of us change one  
**[1:07:56-1:07:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:07:56):**  thing, what would that be?  
**[1:07:58-1:08:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:07:58):**  Well, that is a very good question.  
**[1:08:00-1:08:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:08:00):**  So I think the other question would have been easier.  
**[1:08:05-1:08:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:08:05):**  Apart from that, everybody should eat quality chocolate, obviously, but it's an easy thing.  
**[1:08:09-1:08:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:08:09):**  Yeah, that's something.  
**[1:08:10-1:08:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:08:10):**  No, I mean, we really believe in trees.  
**[1:08:14-1:08:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:08:14):**  That's why we put it in the name of our company, Want2Tree.  
**[1:08:18-1:08:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:08:18):**  And that's not just a fad, but there's a true belief that there is real value in agroforests  
**[1:08:26-1:08:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:08:26):**  and in combining, let's say generally speaking, intercropping and combining permanent tree  
**[1:08:33-1:08:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:08:33):**  cultures with annual crops.  
**[1:08:37-1:08:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:08:37):**  And I would really wish, because I think that is the solution to many problems, be it creating  
**[1:08:44-1:08:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:08:44):**  systems that are more climate resilient, creating systems that have more soil health and thus  
**[1:08:55-1:09:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:08:55):**  more sustainable, and to create systems that can produce different things more efficiently  
**[1:09:03-1:09:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:09:03):**  on the same piece of land.  
**[1:09:05-1:09:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:09:05):**  So I think trees are the answer to many of these points.  
**[1:09:09-1:09:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:09:09):**  And I would wish that every hectare of agricultural production would somehow be optimised in that  
**[1:09:16-1:09:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:09:16):**  regard, because there's a lot of pressure on forests.  
**[1:09:21-1:09:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:09:21):**  Everyone knows that deforestation is continuing.  
**[1:09:26-1:09:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:09:26):**  And a large driver of that is agriculture, be it the small farmers who don't know any  
**[1:09:30-1:09:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:09:30):**  better, or be it the large cattle ranchers who should know better.  
**[1:09:36-1:09:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:09:36):**  And that is a massive driver of deforestation, unless we don't find ways to stop that.  
**[1:09:43-1:09:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:09:43):**  And I think agroforestry systems, I mean, they obviously cannot replace a primary forest  
**[1:09:49-1:09:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:09:49):**  that grew over hundreds of years.  
**[1:09:53-1:09:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:09:53):**  But they can take over some of the much needed function that these systems have.  
**[1:09:59-1:10:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:09:59):**  And so that's what I would wish that really the concept of agroforestry would be embraced  
**[1:10:04-1:10:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:10:04):**  worldwide by all sectors that are active in agriculture, because I think it can.  
**[1:10:10-1:10:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:10:10):**  It can even be part of the corn production that you mentioned.  
**[1:10:15-1:10:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:10:15):**  Why not?  
**[1:10:16-1:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:10:16):**  And where should investors go to learn more about this in the sense like what books to  
**[1:10:22-1:10:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:10:22):**  read, what websites to visit, what places to visit for investors that are listening  
**[1:10:26-1:10:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:10:26):**  and thinking, yeah, of course, I'm focusing on soil, but I haven't really dove deeper  
**[1:10:30-1:10:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:10:30):**  into trees and their function and their role within ecosystems and thus also agriculture.  
**[1:10:37-1:10:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:10:37):**  What would be a good place to start?  
**[1:10:38-1:10:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:10:38):**  Well, the best website is obviously our own, which is...  
**[1:10:42-1:10:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:10:42):**  Which I will link below, yeah.  
**[1:10:43-1:10:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:10:43):**  One, two, three, but no, jokes aside.  
**[1:10:46-1:10:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:10:46):**  Well, I think an excellent source of anything to do with agroforestry is the website of  
**[1:10:53-1:11:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:10:53):**  the World Agroforestry Center, which provides on their website so many examples and acting  
**[1:11:01-1:11:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:11:01):**  globally what can be done in this space.  
**[1:11:04-1:11:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:11:04):**  And for me, it's an inspiration, all the projects that they're doing and all the research and  
**[1:11:10-1:11:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:11:10):**  work that they're providing.  
**[1:11:12-1:11:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:11:12):**  So that's something.  
**[1:11:13-1:11:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:11:13):**  And generally speaking, and I do see, to be honest, if you talk about large institutional  
**[1:11:19-1:11:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:11:19):**  investors, they know where to go.  
**[1:11:22-1:11:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:11:22):**  They come to, let's say, the big conferences in the impact investment space, they go to  
**[1:11:31-1:11:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:11:31):**  the GIN conferences, Global Impact Investment Network.  
**[1:11:39-1:11:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:11:39):**  And it's interesting to see.  
**[1:11:41-1:11:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:11:41):**  I mean, if you went to these conferences five years ago, it was basically dominated by,  
**[1:11:49-1:12:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:11:49):**  let's say, high conviction impact managers, owners of projects who are doing amazing things  
**[1:12:01-1:12:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:12:01):**  out there, and then private individuals who would fund that, foundations or NGOs.  
**[1:12:09-1:12:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:12:09):**  What you see now is a completely dialogue.  
**[1:12:11-1:12:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:12:11):**  First of all, you see these events now have thousands of participants, and I wouldn't  
**[1:12:19-1:12:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:12:19):**  say dominated, but there's been a massive influx of large banks, pension funds, sustainable  
**[1:12:31-1:12:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:12:31):**  investment funds, obviously, all of them managing billions and trillions of assets who are going  
**[1:12:38-1:12:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:12:38):**  there to learn, to share, and that is currently happening.  
**[1:12:44-1:12:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:12:44):**  So I see that scale is coming into the impact investment space.  
**[1:12:48-1:12:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:12:48):**  It's much needed.  
**[1:12:49-1:12:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:12:49):**  And what is needed to translate that into real dollars and euros on the ground?  
**[1:12:54-1:12:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:12:54):**  What's holding them back so far?  
**[1:12:56-1:12:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:12:56):**  Because they've been visiting for a number of years, and they made big statements in  
**[1:12:59-1:13:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:12:59):**  some pension funds cases.  
**[1:13:01-1:13:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:13:01):**  But then if you really, I mean, the really translation into concrete investments, obviously,  
**[1:13:06-1:13:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:13:06):**  you've one pension fund on board, but you've probably had discussions with 50, 100.  
**[1:13:12-1:13:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:13:12):**  What is needed over the next year is to really unlock that institutional capital?  
**[1:13:15-1:13:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:13:15):**  Yes.  
**[1:13:16-1:13:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:13:16):**  Well, I mean, first of all, I would say, I got the statistics in front of me on that  
**[1:13:22-1:13:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:13:22):**  particular topic, that growth is happening.  
**[1:13:25-1:13:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:13:25):**  So I mean, if you look at what is considered assets under sustainable investment, then  
**[1:13:31-1:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:13:31):**  as per end of 2018, we're talking about some 31 billion dollars invested in that space.  
**[1:13:39-1:13:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:13:39):**  Sorry, trillion, 31 trillion.  
**[1:13:42-1:13:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:13:42):**  Now that is a lot of screening and such going on.  
**[1:13:46-1:13:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:13:46):**  So that's not necessarily what we are about.  
**[1:13:49-1:13:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:13:49):**  But you also see a tremendous growth rate in the topic of impact and sustainably themed  
**[1:13:56-1:13:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:13:56):**  investing.  
**[1:13:57-1:14:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:13:57):**  So it is happening, but it's not happening at the scale that you may want.  
**[1:14:02-1:14:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:14:02):**  But is a question also if that industry is ready to do that.  
**[1:14:06-1:14:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:14:06):**  So to scale up, as I said, you need to have those or provide those opportunities to actually  
**[1:14:11-1:14:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:14:11):**  deploy a 50 million dollar ticket.  
**[1:14:17-1:14:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:14:17):**  And ideally, not only one, because obviously, these kind of investors don't like to be 100%  
**[1:14:22-1:14:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:14:22):**  owner.  
**[1:14:23-1:14:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:14:23):**  More than 20% of the fund.  
**[1:14:26-1:14:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:14:26):**  So you need to create opportunities that are 300, 500 million dollars in size, and that  
**[1:14:34-1:14:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:14:34):**  are diversified and so on.  
**[1:14:36-1:14:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:14:36):**  So let's say create large portfolios doesn't necessarily have to be a fund.  
**[1:14:41-1:14:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:14:41):**  That's one thing.  
**[1:14:42-1:14:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:14:42):**  The other is transparency.  
**[1:14:45-1:14:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:14:45):**  And you need to be able to measure impact.  
**[1:14:49-1:14:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:14:49):**  So and that is a complicated thing.  
**[1:14:51-1:14:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:14:51):**  It's not yet fully standardized.  
**[1:14:53-1:14:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:14:53):**  I mean, there's a lot of good tools out there.  
**[1:14:56-1:15:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:14:56):**  But what happens more and more is that investors are asking, OK, I know this has a good positive  
**[1:15:03-1:15:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:15:03):**  impact, but how good is it?  
**[1:15:05-1:15:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:15:05):**  How good is your project in comparison to this other project?  
**[1:15:09-1:15:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:15:09):**  So you need to be able to make it comparable.  
**[1:15:12-1:15:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:15:12):**  And so it's all about standardization, about reporting, which are tools that may sound  
**[1:15:19-1:15:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:15:19):**  boring to some, but they are important to create.  
**[1:15:23-1:15:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:15:23):**  Definitely not the most sexy thing.  
**[1:15:24-1:15:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:15:24):**  But that's why we're recording this.  
**[1:15:25-1:15:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:15:25):**  That's because we need that to build the infrastructure, to build the pipes.  
**[1:15:30-1:15:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:15:30):**  You need certain standards because those institutional investors, they need to report, they need  
**[1:15:34-1:15:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:15:34):**  to explain and justify what they're doing.  
**[1:15:38-1:15:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:15:38):**  And that means they need to be able to demonstrate the impact, which is becoming more and more  
**[1:15:43-1:15:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:15:43):**  important to them as a reporting grid as well, to be able to demonstrate that in a tangible  
**[1:15:52-1:15:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:15:52):**  and trusted way, basically, so that it becomes comparable.  
**[1:15:58-1:15:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:15:58):**  So that is one aspect.  
**[1:15:59-1:16:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:15:59):**  It's, as you say, is maybe not the most sexy aspect for someone who's developing in the  
**[1:16:03-1:16:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:16:03):**  field project, but it's something that is important.  
**[1:16:08-1:16:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:16:08):**  And you do see that just to give you one example, SDG investing.  
**[1:16:13-1:16:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:16:13):**  They are always saying the sustainable development goals of the United Nations, the way they  
**[1:16:18-1:16:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:16:18):**  designed them and present them, it's genius.  
**[1:16:24-1:16:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:16:24):**  And it's catchy.  
**[1:16:26-1:16:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:16:26):**  It's simplifying.  
**[1:16:27-1:16:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:16:27):**  I'm not saying there's no greenwashing happening with that, but people can relate to those  
**[1:16:33-1:16:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:16:33):**  different objectives.  
**[1:16:35-1:16:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:16:35):**  And there's a lot of association of activities, investment activities, with various SDG objectives  
**[1:16:44-1:16:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:16:44):**  happening.  
**[1:16:45-1:16:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:16:45):**  And that makes it very clear and simple, a simple message to relay.  
**[1:16:51-1:16:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:16:51):**  This project supports these kind of objectives, be it hunger, be it education, be it climate  
**[1:16:58-1:17:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:16:58):**  action, it can be very different kind of things.  
**[1:17:01-1:17:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:17:01):**  And that's a way where standardization works in transporting the message.  
**[1:17:06-1:17:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:17:06):**  No, I think it makes a lot of sense.  
**[1:17:07-1:17:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:17:07):**  It made it a very simplified to do list, but actually underneath some very detailed objectives,  
**[1:17:15-1:17:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:17:15):**  which many people, I definitely would urge anybody to dive into it.  
**[1:17:19-1:17:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:17:19):**  It's not an investment list, but it's definitely, it's a very concrete to do list we have with  
**[1:17:25-1:17:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:17:25):**  very concrete targets on almost everything.  
**[1:17:27-1:17:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:17:27):**  Of course, a few things are missing and there's a lot of discussion about that, but it's a  
**[1:17:30-1:17:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:17:30):**  great start for a simplified language and also visual language because everybody knows  
**[1:17:34-1:17:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:17:34):**  the 17 tiles basically.  
**[1:17:36-1:17:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:17:36):**  You see them popping up on every investment presentation and deck, et cetera, which means  
**[1:17:40-1:17:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:17:40):**  it's sort of working.  
**[1:17:41-1:17:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:17:41):**  And obviously ask your questions, dive deeper.  
**[1:17:45-1:17:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:17:45):**  That's what I meant with greenwashing.  
**[1:17:46-1:17:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:17:46):**  Of course, I mean, it's dive deeper and ask your questions because most of it is noise,  
**[1:17:51-1:17:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:17:51):**  but there are interesting people developing very interesting things.  
**[1:17:55-1:17:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:17:55):**  And to end with a final question, I used a lot, we used a lot of time, but I think it  
**[1:17:58-1:18:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:17:58):**  was extremely interesting, but I want to end with the reforestation because we touched  
**[1:18:04-1:18:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:18:04):**  upon it with the coconut part.  
**[1:18:06-1:18:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:18:06):**  But if you would have a blank slate, can you paint a picture of how an ideal agroforestry  
**[1:18:12-1:18:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:18:12):**  system for you would look like?  
**[1:18:15-1:18:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:18:15):**  Could be theoretical, could be based on a current project you have invested in, bought,  
**[1:18:19-1:18:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:18:19):**  et cetera.  
**[1:18:20-1:18:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:18:20):**  How would an ideal agroforestry system for an investor just to imagine if they close  
**[1:18:25-1:18:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:18:25):**  their eyes and they're listening to this audio, how would that look like?  
**[1:18:28-1:18:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:18:28):**  Well, that's not an easy question.  
**[1:18:29-1:18:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:18:29):**  I mean, obviously I could say this particular project that we're currently developing is  
**[1:18:34-1:18:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:18:34):**  the ideal project, but maybe I start with the ideal objectives that it would fulfill  
**[1:18:39-1:18:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:18:39):**  from my point of view, and then we see how that could be done and I'll try to keep it  
**[1:18:43-1:18:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:18:43):**  short.  
**[1:18:44-1:18:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:18:44):**  So for me, it's not only about the production system that you install.  
**[1:18:49-1:18:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:18:49):**  And yes, that needs to be more biodiverse and it needs to create healthy soil whilst  
**[1:18:57-1:19:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:18:57):**  you're producing and basically maintaining it.  
**[1:19:00-1:19:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:19:00):**  And there's a lot of good research out there how to do that and how to combine different  
**[1:19:04-1:19:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:19:04):**  crops to have a sort of stable system that can be maintained in a healthy way with as  
**[1:19:12-1:19:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:19:12):**  little inputs, additional inputs as possible.  
**[1:19:16-1:19:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:19:16):**  And by the way, I'm not an expert on that.  
**[1:19:18-1:19:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:19:18):**  So I'm sure there's many people out there who know an awful lot more than me about this.  
**[1:19:23-1:19:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:19:23):**  I'm more concerned about the additional objectives that this creates, how to integrate these  
**[1:19:29-1:19:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:19:29):**  projects into a landscape, into a community, into societal makeup and the positive impacts  
**[1:19:38-1:19:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:19:38):**  that this can have.  
**[1:19:39-1:19:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:19:39):**  So on the one hand, you have a producing agricultural system or a forestry project, it doesn't matter  
**[1:19:46-1:19:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:19:46):**  in that regard.  
**[1:19:48-1:19:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:19:48):**  But think about all the good things that you can achieve with it in terms of formal employment  
**[1:19:53-1:19:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:19:53):**  on the farm, which creates a lot of opportunity.  
**[1:19:57-1:20:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:19:57):**  Then also when it comes to education and so on for future generations, it keeps people  
**[1:20:02-1:20:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:20:02):**  where they are so they don't have to migrate to urban centers and then ultimately end up  
**[1:20:08-1:20:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:20:08):**  at the borders of Europe or the US.  
**[1:20:11-1:20:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:20:11):**  And all this sort of migration pressure ultimately stems from the lack of opportunity in rural  
**[1:20:17-1:20:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:20:17):**  areas in poor countries.  
**[1:20:20-1:20:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:20:20):**  Deforestation, you can actively fight there by introducing trees into your system and  
**[1:20:26-1:20:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:20:26):**  then beyond that supporting the maintenance and reinvigoration of biodiversity in the  
**[1:20:34-1:20:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:20:34):**  surrounding forests and habitats that you have there.  
**[1:20:39-1:20:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:20:39):**  And of course, social work in the communities themselves and to really strengthen that and  
**[1:20:46-1:20:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:20:46):**  of course locally, sell locally, so don't only sort of buy machinery from Europe, produce  
**[1:20:53-1:20:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:20:53):**  there and then export back to Europe, but actually try to become part of the local regional  
**[1:20:59-1:21:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:20:59):**  value chain so that you create beyond the farm, you're creating jobs in supply chains  
**[1:21:07-1:21:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:21:07):**  and restaurants, etc.  
**[1:21:09-1:21:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:21:09):**  So that's all the things that can happen if you are designing a project in a good way,  
**[1:21:16-1:21:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:21:16):**  that it interacts with its environment basically.  
**[1:21:19-1:21:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:21:19):**  And it's just, as I always say, it's not just an alien spaceship that landed somewhere,  
**[1:21:23-1:21:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:21:23):**  it does precision agriculture and then after a while disappears again and it takes off  
**[1:21:28-1:21:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:21:28):**  again.  
**[1:21:30-1:21:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:21:30):**  So that is super important.  
**[1:21:31-1:21:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:21:31):**  How the system itself looks?  
**[1:21:33-1:21:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:21:33):**  Well, obviously there is a trade-off.  
**[1:21:36-1:21:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:21:36):**  The trade-off lies between efficient production and producing as many different things on  
**[1:21:42-1:21:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:21:42):**  the same piece of land as possible.  
**[1:21:45-1:21:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:21:45):**  So if people think about agroforestry, they may think of like a farmer garden, you know,  
**[1:21:51-1:21:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:21:51):**  with like lots of great things and flowers and I don't know.  
**[1:21:56-1:22:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:21:56):**  That's not how we can produce, you know, I mean, that's not how I can run a large, several  
**[1:22:00-1:22:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:22:00):**  thousand hectares large production system.  
**[1:22:02-1:22:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:22:02):**  It needs to be efficient.  
**[1:22:05-1:22:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:22:05):**  Design needs to use mechanization machinery to an extent, obviously as low impact as possible.  
**[1:22:15-1:22:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:22:15):**  And a lot of design needs to go into that and a lot of additional research.  
**[1:22:21-1:22:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:22:21):**  So for me, the ideal system is one that actually achieves that.  
**[1:22:27-1:22:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:22:27):**  On the one hand, I have what I would say is sufficient biodiversity in the production  
**[1:22:32-1:22:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:22:32):**  system that allows, you know, insects and birds and all sorts of wildlife to actually  
**[1:22:43-1:22:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:22:43):**  also find a habitat in the farm, you know, and use the farm as a stepping stone between  
**[1:22:50-1:22:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:22:50):**  forest areas, say, to have a healthy soil that is well maintained and taken care of  
**[1:22:57-1:23:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:22:57):**  by an experienced farm management team, because, you know, the healthy soil is something that  
**[1:23:04-1:23:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:23:04):**  you don't really see, it's not as easy as showing, hey, we got jaguars on our farm,  
**[1:23:08-1:23:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:23:08):**  you know, that's nice.  
**[1:23:11-1:23:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:23:11):**  But that jaguar actually doesn't contribute that much, it's more an indicator of a healthy  
**[1:23:15-1:23:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:23:15):**  system.  
**[1:23:17-1:23:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:23:17):**  Whereas the healthy soil, you know, it also has a real benefit to your production system,  
**[1:23:22-1:23:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:23:22):**  it stops diseases from spreading, and obviously maintains the production system for decades  
**[1:23:27-1:23:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:23:27):**  to come.  
**[1:23:28-1:23:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:23:28):**  And so I cannot give you a specific, this is how the perfect system should look like.  
**[1:23:33-1:23:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:23:33):**  But those are the kind of topics that it needs to solve and address.  
**[1:23:36-1:23:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:23:36):**  And then it is a perfect system in my view.  
**[1:23:38-1:23:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:23:38):**  I think it's a really good answer, because the perfect system doesn't exist.  
**[1:23:42-1:23:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:23:42):**  So, as you describe it, it really comes to mind holistic decision making, the framework  
**[1:23:48-1:23:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:23:48):**  that holistic management uses, in many cases in grazing and livestock, but it's really,  
**[1:23:53-1:23:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:23:53):**  it's place based.  
**[1:23:54-1:23:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:23:54):**  So the perfect system exists in one place, because and even they are perfect, doesn't  
**[1:23:58-1:24:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:23:58):**  mean anything because as you mentioned, there's still so much research needed and to see where  
**[1:24:03-1:24:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:24:03):**  these systems could go.  
**[1:24:04-1:24:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:24:04):**  I just released an interview on Syntropic Agroforestry.  
**[1:24:08-1:24:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:24:08):**  And there's these people experimenting, in some cases for many years, but experimenting  
**[1:24:12-1:24:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:24:12):**  of where agroforestry could go.  
**[1:24:14-1:24:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:24:14):**  And obviously, they're also the big question is of how complex can it be while it's still  
**[1:24:18-1:24:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:24:18):**  manageable and what kind of mechanization tools we actually need.  
**[1:24:22-1:24:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:24:22):**  And so we're just scratching, pun intended, the surface of what is possible with land  
**[1:24:28-1:24:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:24:28):**  use and agriculture and also in sea, obviously.  
**[1:24:30-1:24:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:24:30):**  And I think that's what makes it so exciting.  
**[1:24:32-1:24:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:24:32):**  So I want to thank you so much for taking the time.  
**[1:24:34-1:24:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:24:34):**  We took a lot of time, but I think there was a lot to discuss.  
**[1:24:36-1:24:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:24:36):**  And as we're taking a list there are so many other podcasts to dive deeper into this, but  
**[1:24:41-1:24:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:24:41):**  I will be, we'll keep that for another time.  
**[1:24:44-1:24:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:24:44):**  Thank you so much, Oliver, for taking the time this Friday morning.  
**[1:24:47-1:24:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:24:47):**  And I'm very much looking forward to keep checking in with you and how 123 is doing.  
**[1:24:53-1:24:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:24:53):**  Well, thank you very much.  
**[1:24:54-1:24:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:24:54):**  Thank you for giving me this opportunity.  
**[1:24:55-1:25:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:24:55):**  And I hope you do a good editing job to bring this down from two hours.  
**[1:25:01-1:25:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:25:01):**  We don't do a lot of editing, so it's going to be a full release.  
**[1:25:03-1:25:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:25:03):**  But I think we're going to do a summary as well, which is going to be a challenge to  
**[1:25:07-1:25:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:25:07):**  cut because it's always difficult to cut it down to 10 minutes or 15 minutes.  
**[1:25:11-1:25:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:25:11):**  It was a real pleasure.  
**[1:25:12-1:25:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:25:12):**  Thank you.  
**[1:25:13-1:25:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:25:13):**  Thank you so much.

**[1:26:01-1:26:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:26:01):**  Dear friends of the podcast, I'm super excited to share with you the online video course  
**[1:26:06-1:26:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:26:06):**  Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[1:26:10-1:26:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:26:10):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  
**[1:26:14-1:26:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:26:14):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[1:26:16-1:26:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:26:16):**  After a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of audio asking the question  
**[1:26:19-1:26:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:26:19):**  how to put money to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011  
**[1:26:24-1:26:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:26:24):**  and recording this podcast since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  
**[1:26:29-1:26:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:26:29):**  What have we seen in the space over the last years?

**[1:27:24-1:27:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:27:24):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[1:27:26-1:27:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:27:26):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you and I'm very aware  
**[1:27:31-1:27:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:27:31):**  that among the listeners of this podcast we have people with very different means.  
**[1:27:36-1:27:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:27:36):**  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[1:27:41-1:27:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:27:41):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[1:27:44-1:27:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:27:44):**  Thank you.  
**[1:27:45-1:27:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:27:45):**  So what is this course?  
**[1:27:46-1:27:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:27:46):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  
**[1:27:53-1:27:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:27:53):**  so you don't have to ride along.  
**[1:27:54-1:27:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:27:54):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[1:27:59-1:28:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:27:59):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[1:28:05-1:28:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:28:05):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[1:28:10-1:28:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:28:10):**  if you're a soil builder.  
**[1:28:11-1:28:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:28:11):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[1:28:16-1:28:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:28:16):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[1:28:20-1:28:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:28:20):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[1:28:25-1:28:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:28:25):**  So what is it not?  
**[1:28:26-1:28:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:28:26):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[1:28:28-1:28:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:28:28):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[1:28:30-1:28:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:28:30):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[1:28:34-1:28:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:28:34):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[1:28:36-1:28:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:28:36):**  Before making any investment please find professional investment advice.  
**[1:28:41-1:28:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/03/20/oliver-hanke/#t=1:28:41):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking.

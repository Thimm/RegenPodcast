### Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food  (Tue, 21 Sep 2021 17:00:00)
## 132 Jason Hayward Jones, making super accurate keyline design on a landscape scale on 10000 hectares altering the behaviour of water  
**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:00:00):**  Water is absolutely crucial for any farm. Many brittle places have water but it's concentrated  
**[0:00:05-0:00:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:00:05):**  in very short rainy seasons leading to massive erosion and long dry periods. So identifying  
**[0:00:11-0:00:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:00:11):**  yeoman's key points and key lines on or off contour and thus altering the behaviour of  
**[0:00:17-0:00:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:00:17):**  water has proved to be very successful around the world in regenerating soils and farms.  
**[0:00:22-0:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:00:22):**  It has been traditionally done by walking the land. What if we could teach an algorithm  
**[0:00:26-0:00:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:00:26):**  to do it potentially even more accurately? That would open up landscape scale design  
**[0:00:31-0:00:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:00:31):**  of water systems and where to plant trees, graze animals, etc. etc.  
**[0:00:37-0:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:00:37):**  Tempering climate change, bringing back rivers, preventing floods and obviously lots and lots  
**[0:00:42-0:00:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:00:42):**  of nutrient dense food. The promises of Regen-ac often sound straight out of a science fiction  
**[0:00:48-0:00:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:00:48):**  book. And for these promises to be met we need to significantly scale regeneration to  
**[0:00:53-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:00:53):**  a landscape scale within this decade. Welcome to a new series where we look into  
**[0:00:58-0:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:00:58):**  the technologies needed to bring regeneration to a landscape scale. In this series we'll  
**[0:01:03-0:01:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:01:03):**  look at already existing technologies, digital tech, ag tech, new financing mechanisms etc.  
**[0:01:08-0:01:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:01:08):**  that can scale fast enough during the next 10 years. Technologies which put significantly  
**[0:01:13-0:01:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:01:13):**  more money into the pockets of farmers, landowners and land stewards who are regenerating their  
**[0:01:18-0:01:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:01:18):**  and our soils so they can go faster. And we'll ask the question what is missing?  
**[0:01:23-0:01:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:01:23):**  What needs to be urgently developed over the next years?  
**[0:01:26-0:01:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:01:26):**  We're very happy with the support for this series by the Grantham Environmental Trust  
**[0:01:31-0:01:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:01:31):**  which supports strategic communications and collaboration in solving the world's most

**[0:02:07-0:02:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:02:07):**  Welcome to another episode. Today I want to start with reading a small piece of an article  
**[0:02:11-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:02:11):**  that caught my attention and why I reached out to Jason to record this interview. For  
**[0:02:15-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:02:15):**  the first time in Nigeria, marking an important milestone in the booming regenerative agriculture  
**[0:02:19-0:02:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:02:19):**  sector, Regen Farm has used satellite data to produce an artificial intelligence generated  
**[0:02:24-0:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:02:24):**  design plotting a regenerative agroforestry system. Using Yeoman's key point and key line  
**[0:02:31-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:02:31):**  principles on a landscape scale, designing including cultivation lines on contour multi-species  
**[0:02:37-0:02:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:02:37):**  tree planting and water storage infrastructure was produced in the UK for use in Nigeria.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:02:42):**  The AI generated design was found to be accurate within 0.1 meters and the groundwork will  
**[0:02:47-0:02:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:02:47):**  begin shortly to turn the design into reality. This obviously piqued my interest and I reached  
**[0:02:52-0:02:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:02:52):**  out to Jason who agreed to come on the show and talk about this and a lot more. So welcome  
**[0:02:57-0:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:02:57):**  Jason.  
**[0:02:58-0:02:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:02:58):**  Thank you, Corinne. It's great to be here.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:02:59):**  I think it's the first time or one of the first times I saw the words Yeoman key point  
**[0:03:04-0:03:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:03:04):**  and key line used in the same sentence as artificial intelligence. So we're going to  
**[0:03:08-0:03:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:03:08):**  unpack that. But first, I want to hear a bit more about you and how you came to work on  
**[0:03:13-0:03:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:03:13):**  soil in soil and especially on water, obviously, like what led you to doing this regenerative  
**[0:03:18-0:03:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:03:18):**  work?  
**[0:03:19-0:03:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:03:19):**  Sure, I've been in farming all my teenage and adult life. Farming was a lot different  
**[0:03:25-0:03:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:03:25):**  back when I was younger. But something clicked, I think when I first stepped onto a farm,  
**[0:03:30-0:03:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:03:30):**  I kind of loved the environment, was embraced by it. And I thought, well, this is what I  
**[0:03:36-0:03:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:03:36):**  want to do. And then led me to becoming involved in farm management and farm consultancy, not  
**[0:03:43-0:03:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:03:43):**  just in the UK, but around the world. And the sustainability of food production was  
**[0:03:50-0:03:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:03:50):**  very interesting to me. I studied at Agricultural College in the UK where that wasn't a big  
**[0:03:56-0:04:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:03:56):**  component of what we did. We were taught how to drive big tractors and spray chemicals  
**[0:04:02-0:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:04:02):**  and all this put fertilizer everywhere. And I left that becoming a bit disillusioned,  
**[0:04:10-0:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:04:10):**  but determined that there is another way. And so working in different cultures and locations  
**[0:04:18-0:04:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:04:18):**  around the world, I learned a lot from the way farming is traditionally done. And then  
**[0:04:25-0:04:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:04:25):**  that sort of led me down the path of sustainable agriculture and permaculture. And I found  
**[0:04:33-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:04:33):**  myself in Australia, married an Australian girl, kids were born in Australia. But that's  
**[0:04:39-0:04:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:04:39):**  where the permaculture movement started with Bill Mollison and David Holgrim. And that  
**[0:04:44-0:04:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:04:44):**  really fascinated me. And 15 years ago, we were kind of sitting around campfires singing  
**[0:04:52-0:04:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:04:52):**  about permaculture. And then this term regenerative agriculture came in. But now, instead of sitting  
**[0:04:58-0:05:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:04:58):**  around campfires, we're sitting in boardrooms talking about it. So it's come a long way.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:05:03):**  And it's fascinating how it's come out of the shadows really. And people are grasping  
**[0:05:09-0:05:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:05:09):**  it. It's a big term, regenerative agriculture. And people first, what is it? How do we unpack  
**[0:05:16-0:05:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:05:16):**  it? But it can be described in several ways. But it's definitely something that's very  
**[0:05:23-0:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:05:23):**  important personally, in my life to pursue this and becoming interesting from a business  
**[0:05:28-0:05:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:05:28):**  angle for family farmers, commercial farmers. So it's a great journey to be on.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:05:35):**  And coming out of that ag school where it was about big tractors and a lot of spraying,  
**[0:05:40-0:05:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:05:40):**  and you mentioned you knew there was another way or there was a different way. How did  
**[0:05:45-0:05:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:05:45):**  you knew that? Was there one lesson that piqued any interest? Did you visit one of the leading  
**[0:05:50-0:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:05:50):**  organic farms or one of the pioneers? Or how did you know? Because there was no YouTube,  
**[0:05:54-0:05:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:05:54):**  there were very little books, there was no permaculture design course I'm imagining in  
**[0:05:57-0:06:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:05:57):**  the UK yet, or maybe there was, but it was in the shadows. How did you know, and didn't  
**[0:06:01-0:06:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:06:01):**  just join a big tractor operating farm somewhere?  
**[0:06:06-0:06:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:06:06):**  There was this one, I think about half an hour's worth of a lecture that started discussing  
**[0:06:12-0:06:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:06:12):**  organic production without the use of artificial things. And that's all we had to that little  
**[0:06:18-0:06:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:06:18):**  hook to grab hold of.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:06:20):**  It's turned your career around, basically changed your whole path.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:06:23):**  Yeah, it did. But of course, back then it was very slow. And people were very skeptical  
**[0:06:27-0:06:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:06:27):**  of which, you know, a lot of people still are. But thankfully, that whole scene has  
**[0:06:32-0:06:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:06:32):**  got bigger and more professional and more accepted. And now that side of things is growing  
**[0:06:38-0:06:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:06:38):**  quickly, as opposed to that conventional way of doing things is under pressure. So I think  
**[0:06:46-0:06:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:06:46):**  we're going down the right route, finally. But there's a long way to go still.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:06:51):**  There is no, it's where in the first innings or in the first minutes of a very long match  
**[0:06:57-0:07:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:06:57):**  or whatever sport we're playing. And how did that lead from singing around the campfire  
**[0:07:02-0:07:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:07:02):**  about permaculture to working on technology to scale many of the key principles which  
**[0:07:08-0:07:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:07:08):**  are around water, which will start to unpack? That seems a big, a big step, because many  
**[0:07:13-0:07:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:07:13):**  of the permaculture designs I've seen, and I've interacted with are relatively small  
**[0:07:18-0:07:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:07:18):**  scale because they're very human focused, which is very good, because you need to interact  
**[0:07:22-0:07:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:07:22):**  closely with the landscape and read it. And there are only very few people that are able  
**[0:07:25-0:07:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:07:25):**  to do that. But that hence, that's usually a relatively small farm even could be a huge  
**[0:07:30-0:07:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:07:30):**  one in Australia, but still on the grand scheme of things, it's quite small. So where did  
**[0:07:35-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:07:35):**  that from seeing the campfire to programming these kind of complicated algorithms? How  
**[0:07:40-0:07:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:07:40):**  did that go?  
**[0:07:41-0:07:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:07:41):**  Sure, sure. Well, I was at the time, and I still do have a consulting business, just  
**[0:07:47-0:07:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:07:47):**  helping farmers improve their business performance. And that involves me at some point, walking  
**[0:07:54-0:08:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:07:54):**  around the fields and measuring things and with a tape measure or a spirit level or  
**[0:08:00-0:08:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:08:00):**  something like that.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:08:01):**  When you say measure things, what is that?  
**[0:08:04-0:08:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:08:04):**  Well, you know, for designing, you know, let's have something here, something, it was a very  
**[0:08:08-0:08:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:08:08):**  practical way of doing things hands on, face to face, and fantastic. And I enjoy that still.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:08:17):**  But my idea was it well, if, if we were to open up regenerative agriculture to be more  
**[0:08:23-0:08:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:08:23):**  accessible to many more farmers, it's going to require millions of me to do this. And  
**[0:08:32-0:08:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:08:32):**  so we need to be able to scale out with some kind of technology. And so the idea for Regen  
**[0:08:37-0:08:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:08:37):**  Farm was to develop, this was my initial thought to develop a digital version of myself. And  
**[0:08:43-0:08:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:08:43):**  so some way, I can interact not just with say, 20 farmers a year, but 2000 or 20,000.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:08:51):**  And that was as that stage, that was as far as my technological knowledge went. So I said,  
**[0:08:57-0:09:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:08:57):**  well, I have this basic idea of what we want to do. And I went to the Impact Lab, Environmental  
**[0:09:04-0:09:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:09:04):**  Impact Lab at Exeter University Science Park, and it was their opening day. And I rocked  
**[0:09:10-0:09:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:09:10):**  up there with a kind of one pager and said, look, I've got this idea. And I talked to  
**[0:09:15-0:09:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:09:15):**  the people there from the Impact Lab and from Rothamsted Research, and they said, well,  
**[0:09:18-0:09:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:09:18):**  this looks interesting. And let's develop a prototype to see where this might go. And  
**[0:09:24-0:09:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:09:24):**  so they did. And we field tested that with a number of local farmers. And it got a little  
**[0:09:29-0:09:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:09:29):**  bit of traction, a little bit of interest. You could see this little click in people's  
**[0:09:34-0:09:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:09:34):**  minds saying, oh, hold on a second. This is useful. This is a way we can use a kind of  
**[0:09:38-0:09:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:09:38):**  a simulation software to help those farmers who are nervous or reluctant to change their  
**[0:09:47-0:09:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:09:47):**  production methods and go down a different pathway. This could possibly be a good tool  
**[0:09:53-0:09:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:09:53):**  for them. And it all started there, really. But I quickly realized that that was the limit  
**[0:09:58-0:10:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:09:58):**  of my technological knowledge. And so I had to involve other people for coding development,  
**[0:10:06-0:10:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:10:06):**  algorithm development. And that was the real interesting bit for myself in these early  
**[0:10:12-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:10:12):**  stages. It's how do you take this high-tech coding algorithm sector and merge it with  
**[0:10:22-0:10:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:10:22):**  the agricultural industry, which is at some point archaic, like this, I described it as  
**[0:10:30-0:10:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:10:30):**  a lumbering dinosaur that's just lurching forward. And how do we join those two worlds  
**[0:10:37-0:10:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:10:37):**  together and make some improvements? And again, that was kind of just a very loose description  
**[0:10:44-0:10:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:10:44):**  of the ideas I had. But involving other people, algorithm development experts, other technology  
**[0:10:51-0:11:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:10:51):**  people helped us shape something that would be very usable by farmers and by different  
**[0:11:00-0:11:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:11:00):**  sectors to help all of those stakeholders take a few more steps down that regenerative  
**[0:11:08-0:11:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:11:08):**  agriculture path. So that was kind of the early stages of it. That was about three years  
**[0:11:13-0:11:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:11:13):**  ago now. And things have really come along well and gone off in different directions  
**[0:11:18-0:11:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:11:18):**  that I never thought we'd be going down. But it's just wonderful.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:11:23):**  And the first steps, were you already working on or going after the water side of things  
**[0:11:29-0:11:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:11:29):**  on a landscape level or on the farm level? Was that your entry point saying, okay, if  
**[0:11:34-0:11:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:11:34):**  there's one thing that technology could help and helping these farms that want to make  
**[0:11:39-0:11:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:11:39):**  a few more steps or want to make the first few steps, we have to start with water? Or  
**[0:11:43-0:11:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:11:43):**  if you look at the scale of permanence, it's one of those first steps. Like why did you  
**[0:11:47-0:11:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:11:47):**  choose for the water side of things and not, I don't know, using AI technology to help  
**[0:11:54-0:11:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:11:54):**  better compost facilities or better local bio fertilizer or something like that?  
**[0:11:59-0:12:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:11:59):**  A wise man once told me that there are only eight ingredients to any food production system  
**[0:12:08-0:12:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:12:08):**  anywhere on earth. And they are, he explained to me, in order of magnitude, I guess, sun  
**[0:12:16-0:12:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:12:16):**  and air, soil, water, plants, animals, people and money. And if you mix all those together  
**[0:12:25-0:12:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:12:25):**  in different ways, you have an agricultural food production industry.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:12:29):**  So the first two, sun and air, it's hard to manipulate those. Like kind of it is what  
**[0:12:35-0:12:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:12:35):**  it is. So let's leave those. But the next two, soil and water, if you can improve those  
**[0:12:44-0:12:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:12:44):**  things on a farm, make them better, have them work with you, then you're setting yourself  
**[0:12:50-0:12:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:12:50):**  up for success. So working with the soil and water was very appealing. And it took us back  
**[0:12:58-0:13:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:12:58):**  a few steps. Then we started to think about, okay, how do we understand how soil and water  
**[0:13:04-0:13:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:13:04):**  behaves on a landscape? How do we capture that information? And how do we use that to  
**[0:13:12-0:13:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:13:12):**  help us redesign how a farm works using these principles that were first developed by P.A.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:13:19):**  Yeomans back in the 50s in Australia. He works in very brittle landscapes, very dry landscapes  
**[0:13:28-0:13:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:13:28):**  where water is crucial. Absolutely king if you don't have it.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:13:33):**  So what are the principles for anybody? I mean, we know Yeomans also from a plough,  
**[0:13:36-0:13:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:13:36):**  which is not really a plough, but there's technology came out of that ecosystem as well.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:13:42):**  But what are the principles for anybody that hasn't done those deep dives?  
**[0:13:48-0:13:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:13:48):**  So very simply, when he talks about water and about key points and key lines, if you  
**[0:13:55-0:14:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:13:55):**  can identify in a landscape where the water changes behavior, where that convex landscape  
**[0:14:02-0:14:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:14:02):**  going down the hill turns into a concave landscape, at that key point is the point at which water  
**[0:14:10-0:14:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:14:10):**  begins to behave differently, becomes less erosive and more able to deposit things. And  
**[0:14:16-0:14:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:14:16):**  at that point, you're able to passively manipulate its behavior by taking it sideways along contours  
**[0:14:24-0:14:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:14:24):**  and rehydrate the landscape. So I thought, well, if we can have a technological tool.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:14:31):**  Because you used to do this by hand, used to walk the land. And a lot of people do that.  
**[0:14:36-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:14:36):**  And it's very, I've seen it happen. It's very difficult to do. It's very difficult to do  
**[0:14:40-0:14:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:14:40):**  by eye as well, because landscapes always seem different than they actually are. Like  
**[0:14:45-0:14:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:14:45):**  water behaves, it seems to run uphill in some cases, but it's not obviously. But it seems  
**[0:14:49-0:14:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:14:49):**  our eyes are good at it, but not very good. And so you need to train a lot to be able  
**[0:14:54-0:14:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:14:54):**  to walk the contours properly and then to do it. But it's such an essential job that  
**[0:14:59-0:15:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:14:59):**  we've done. If you look at most landscapes, I'm looking at a hilly landscape here right  
**[0:15:02-0:15:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:15:02):**  in front of me. We haven't like we just planted even up the hill. If you see most landscapes  
**[0:15:07-0:15:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:15:07):**  when it rains, or when water comes, it's yeah, it's absolutely not capturing it to the fullest  
**[0:15:14-0:15:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:15:14):**  to use an understatement. But so you used to do that by hand and by eye and with some  
**[0:15:18-0:15:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:15:18):**  very rudimental tools. And you said, No, let's bring that to technology space where there  
**[0:15:23-0:15:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:15:23):**  are no human eyes that can make interesting errors.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:15:26):**  Exactly. In order to be able to do it by eye, you have to be this sort of landscape whisperer  
**[0:15:33-0:15:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:15:33):**  that, you know, knows how it works. And I, you know, I'm not that, that's for sure.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:15:39):**  So I can get it to within about five meters or something like that. But it has to be more  
**[0:15:44-0:15:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:15:44):**  accurate, I think, to get the most from it. So we employed some data acquisition and ran  
**[0:15:52-0:15:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:15:52):**  a lot of data through some test algorithms to define not only where that key point would  
**[0:15:59-0:16:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:15:59):**  be, but also how we could do different channels along contour or just off contour. And it  
**[0:16:06-0:16:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:16:06):**  really taught us how the power of artificial intelligence in large landscape designs is  
**[0:16:13-0:16:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:16:13):**  really useful. Now if we had a couple of acres, and you know, we can go around and it's about  
**[0:16:19-0:16:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:16:19):**  there and that's fine. But the landscapes we're working on are hundreds of 1000s of  
**[0:16:24-0:16:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:16:24):**  hectares. So for me to walk around with a with a tape measure in a spirit level, it  
**[0:16:31-0:16:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:16:31):**  just wouldn't happen.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:16:33):**  Even if you had 100 of Jason's or even I don't even know what what's what would be the number  
**[0:16:38-0:16:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:16:38):**  of people in the world that are let's say landscape whisperers, they're very much obviously  
**[0:16:42-0:16:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:16:42):**  there they're always busy because they have an endless amount of clients. But even them  
**[0:16:47-0:16:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:16:47):**  all put together probably couldn't easily do 100,000 acres or hectares like that. And  
**[0:16:52-0:16:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:16:52):**  we need to do like 2 billion hectares that are degraded. So it's just the math math just  
**[0:16:57-0:17:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:16:57):**  simply doesn't work even if we 10x it or 100x the amount of people that are good at this.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:17:02):**  And the speed with which you can do it as well. So we designed this system which for  
**[0:17:06-0:17:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:17:06):**  one of our clients in in Nigeria, we'll speak about that.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:17:10):**  Yeah, let's talk about the project just describe this is in if I understood well, in northern  
**[0:17:14-0:17:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:17:14):**  Nigeria just describe the landscape because we are in an audio podcast just to for us  
**[0:17:18-0:17:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:17:18):**  to feel if we won't walk around there. What would we see? What would we touch? What would  
**[0:17:22-0:17:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:17:22):**  we feel and smell?  
**[0:17:23-0:17:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:17:23):**  Sure. Northern Nigeria based around the city of Kano very flat, very arid and the water  
**[0:17:30-0:17:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:17:30):**  comes in large amounts during the rainy season and then drains away the soil is very low  
**[0:17:36-0:17:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:17:36):**  in organic matter. So it's kind of boom and bust territory, massive amounts of erosion.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:17:43):**  So even when it's very flat, this kind of water work is possible and essential. Asking  
**[0:17:48-0:17:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:17:48):**  a very stupid question probably.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:17:49):**  But yeah, yes, yes. I mean, it's easy to see in a mountainous landscape or hilly landscape  
**[0:17:55-0:18:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:17:55):**  how water behaves. But if you get flatter, those undulations are far more subtle and  
**[0:18:03-0:18:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:18:03):**  nuanced and and you can't sometimes see them with the naked eye. But you can see the results  
**[0:18:08-0:18:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:18:08):**  of it with big channels being cut, big erosion taking place. So to have something that measures  
**[0:18:17-0:18:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:18:17):**  the water movement in centimeter differences and it starts there, right? So a river channel  
**[0:18:24-0:18:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:18:24):**  starts to erode a bit, a bit every year and all of a sudden you've got something as deep  
**[0:18:30-0:18:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:18:30):**  as, you know, several meters and your topsoil is gone. So that landscape lends itself to  
**[0:18:36-0:18:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:18:36):**  accuracy, high resolution data. And so what we did was for the first test plot, we thought,  
**[0:18:44-0:18:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:18:44):**  well, let's go for it. Let's do a 10,000 hectare plot and see what we can go.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:18:48):**  Let's start small.  
**[0:18:49-0:18:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:18:49):**  Let's start small and manageable, of course. And everybody, all the tech guys just groaning  
**[0:18:54-0:18:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:18:54):**  at me going, oh God. But no, no, let's go for it. And this was on our client's land,  
**[0:18:59-0:19:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:18:59):**  Tajuddin Dantatta's land, his personal land and the community that surrounded it. So it's  
**[0:19:05-0:19:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:19:05):**  not a random place. It's actually something we'll be working on in the future with this  
**[0:19:10-0:19:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:19:10):**  design. So we continue to develop the algorithm and inserted sort of additions like agroforestry  
**[0:19:17-0:19:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:19:17):**  lines and water channels, water storage areas, where would be the best places for these to  
**[0:19:24-0:19:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:19:24):**  be sighted on the landscape. Just to come up with a big design as a starting point.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:19:30):**  And the data you use was satellites plus others or what's the input data you need to get to  
**[0:19:36-0:19:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:19:36):**  that accuracy?  
**[0:19:37-0:19:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:19:37):**  Yeah, it was satellite data down to about one meter resolution. The free stuff, the  
**[0:19:45-0:19:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:19:45):**  Sentinel data, EU satellites is 25 meter resolution. So to look at those subtle differences on  
**[0:19:52-0:19:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:19:52):**  a flat landscape, it wasn't enough. It's like looking through the landscape through a blurred  
**[0:19:56-0:20:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:19:56):**  set of glasses and you couldn't see it. So it was expensive to buy the data, but we bought  
**[0:20:03-0:20:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:20:03):**  it and pushed it through the algorithms and they gave this design. And then I was in Nigeria  
**[0:20:09-0:20:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:20:09):**  a few months ago and the team says, okay, we think we've got it. Can you go around and  
**[0:20:14-0:20:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:20:14):**  ground truth it and see what's what? So they gave me a few test areas to do this. And the  
**[0:20:20-0:20:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:20:20):**  day we went, it was during Ramadan, so nobody's drinking any water. It was 45 degrees and  
**[0:20:27-0:20:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:20:27):**  we must have walked for several hours just ground truthing this thing. It was a very  
**[0:20:34-0:20:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:20:34):**  difficult day, but by the end of it, we all kind of compared notes and said, well, that  
**[0:20:39-0:20:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:20:39):**  works. This thing works not only on paper, but we plotted where the starting point would  
**[0:20:44-0:20:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:20:44):**  be, where an agroforestry system would go, where the water channel would go. And it made  
**[0:20:48-0:20:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:20:48):**  sense.  
**[0:20:49-0:20:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:20:49):**  Like you walked it and you could see that you would have said something similar if you  
**[0:20:54-0:20:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:20:54):**  wouldn't have had that already made design.  
**[0:20:57-0:20:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:20:57):**  Exactly.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:20:58):**  Were there surprises? Like things that you considered, like I wouldn't have thought about  
**[0:21:01-0:21:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:21:01):**  it, but actually it makes sense what the algorithm suggested.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:21:04):**  There were no surprises, but it was just confirming that the algorithm had learned to do this,  
**[0:21:10-0:21:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:21:10):**  to place this design on the landscape accurately. And we were walking around with the local  
**[0:21:16-0:21:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:21:16):**  farmers and they said, yeah, how does water behave here? Where traditionally does the  
**[0:21:21-0:21:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:21:21):**  rain fall and where does it go? And so just some local knowledge infused with that artificial  
**[0:21:27-0:21:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:21:27):**  intelligence really was very exciting. It was a big relief for us that it worked.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:21:34):**  Yeah, we made it, but it didn't make any sense. They were saying, no, no, water never goes  
**[0:21:37-0:21:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:21:37):**  like that.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:21:38):**  Yes, yes. So we got back to the car and rehydrated ourselves. And then we said, well, we really  
**[0:21:45-0:21:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:21:45):**  have something quite powerful here.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:21:48):**  So basically there's key point and the key lines were sort of mapped on the map or there  
**[0:21:54-0:21:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:21:54):**  was a layer on the map. And then you started adding extra layers of where could some ponds  
**[0:21:58-0:22:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:21:58):**  be or some other water features. And then you expanded it to agriculture features like  
**[0:22:04-0:22:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:22:04):**  agroforestry systems and where does tree make sense, but also which type of tree, like what  
**[0:22:08-0:22:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:22:08):**  is the level of detail you managed to get to?  
**[0:22:10-0:22:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:22:10):**  Yeah, so we built up in different layers where the contours of the land are, how key points  
**[0:22:15-0:22:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:22:15):**  and key lines work on that digital elevation model.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:22:19):**  And just currently the land is, you said it's flat, it's very dry. It rains. When it rains,  
**[0:22:23-0:22:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:22:23):**  it rains a lot. Are there a lot of trees on the landscape? What is the current state or  
**[0:22:28-0:22:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:22:28):**  what's the current feature?  
**[0:22:30-0:22:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:22:30):**  It's cultivated, but in straight lines with big erosion valleys cutting through. And so  
**[0:22:37-0:22:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:22:37):**  you could see how that production system is placed incorrectly on the landscape. It doesn't  
**[0:22:43-0:22:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:22:43):**  work from an ecological point of view. So if we were to change the design of how cultivation  
**[0:22:50-0:22:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:22:50):**  worked and how water flows and it would be regenerative rather than degenerative.  
**[0:22:57-0:23:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:22:57):**  Would it mean to cut down all the current trees and start from scratch or do you adapt  
**[0:23:01-0:23:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:23:01):**  the system to, okay, that one needs to go or that one, we need to plant more there or...  
**[0:23:06-0:23:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:23:06):**  No trees are ever cut down. And some of the trees in this landscape were very mature mango  
**[0:23:13-0:23:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:23:13):**  trees. So you wouldn't want to be cutting any trees down at all.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:23:16):**  Even if they're on the wrong spot.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:23:18):**  Even if they're on the wrong spot, leave them. They were there before us and they'll be there  
**[0:23:21-0:23:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:23:21):**  long after we're gone, I'm sure, but never cut down a tree. It's done its best to be  
**[0:23:26-0:23:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:23:26):**  there. So leave it. So our designs would be placed onto the existing tree pattern.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:23:34):**  And the algorithm takes that into account because it sees the current features, which  
**[0:23:38-0:23:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:23:38):**  are trees and houses and small villages.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:23:40):**  Exactly. And trees know what they're doing. So they're obviously doing well there. They  
**[0:23:44-0:23:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:23:44):**  found a good place to grow.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:23:46):**  So they are in a good spot. They're not in the wrong spot.  
**[0:23:48-0:23:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:23:48):**  Exactly. So let's try and use those to help us understand how the landscape works and  
**[0:23:53-0:23:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:23:53):**  mimic their growth patterns rather than trying to force it in a direction it doesn't want  
**[0:23:58-0:23:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:23:58):**  to go.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:23:59):**  So what's next now? Where are you? We're talking summer 2021. What is the client doing currently  
**[0:24:06-0:24:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:24:06):**  or wants to do? Or what are the next steps in implementing some of this or testing?  
**[0:24:11-0:24:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:24:11):**  Let me speak a bit about our partners in Nigeria. It's only about a year ago, actually, that  
**[0:24:17-0:24:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:24:17):**  they first contacted us, the Dantatta family, a very old family with a great legacy in northern  
**[0:24:24-0:24:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:24:24):**  Nigeria. And they work with many hundreds of thousands of small farmers. The Dantatta  
**[0:24:30-0:24:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:24:30):**  family process a lot of rice and groundnuts and all those, the soybeans, all those too  
**[0:24:37-0:24:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:24:37):**  for the Nigerian market and overseas. But they quite correctly thought, as we move forward  
**[0:24:45-0:24:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:24:45):**  and climate change begins to really hit these small farmers, not just in Nigeria, but everywhere,  
**[0:24:53-0:24:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:24:53):**  it's their business that is under threat as well as the small farmers livelihood. So to  
**[0:24:57-0:25:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:24:57):**  have some kind of regenerative agriculture program for their entire outgrower schemes  
**[0:25:03-0:25:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:25:03):**  is not only the right thing to do, but it's also good for business.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:25:08):**  So they said, can you help us design the landscape and then work with the farmers to switch them  
**[0:25:13-0:25:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:25:13):**  over to transition them? So it was with Tajideen's vision and working with our technology that  
**[0:25:21-0:25:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:25:21):**  we put those two things together and came up with a big plan for them. And this plan  
**[0:25:26-0:25:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:25:26):**  is also being embraced by the UK government and their aid programs, forcing their thinking  
**[0:25:34-0:25:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:25:34):**  down, okay, let's use regenerative agriculture as this vehicle for development. And then  
**[0:25:41-0:25:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:25:41):**  the more farmers we can get involved in these schemes, that has flow on effects for the  
**[0:25:46-0:25:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:25:46):**  environment and social benefits, a whole raft of benefits. So it was from that discussion  
**[0:25:53-0:25:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:25:53):**  and that close relationship with the Dantatta family that we said, okay, this is one of  
**[0:25:58-0:26:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:25:58):**  our firm footprints overseas and a very interesting environment to work with where you can really  
**[0:26:05-0:26:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:26:05):**  see the results of regenerative agriculture, not just working with the water infrastructure  
**[0:26:11-0:26:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:26:11):**  and how that flows in the landscape, but things like cover crops, humic soil additives, a  
**[0:26:19-0:26:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:26:19):**  whole suite of interventions actually, which put humus back in the soil, organic matter,  
**[0:26:26-0:26:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:26:26):**  carbon, of course, and therefore you can really see how the landscape responds quickly. I  
**[0:26:32-0:26:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:26:32):**  guess there, like in Australia, you're starting from a very low base and any carbon and organic  
**[0:26:39-0:26:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:26:39):**  matter you can put back in the soil, really see the benefits quite quickly.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:26:45):**  So that's our work there is ongoing. I go to Nigeria every few months to push it along  
**[0:26:52-0:26:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:26:52):**  and it's the whole regenerative agriculture theme has become embraced by people to such  
**[0:26:58-0:27:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:26:58):**  an extent that they didn't have words for regenerative agriculture. So we've had to  
**[0:27:03-0:27:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:27:03):**  make some up in Hausa and Fulani languages. So farmers are now, they understand what we're  
**[0:27:10-0:27:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:27:10):**  talking about. We're not talking technical things. We're using that regenerative agricultural  
**[0:27:16-0:27:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:27:16):**  term in local languages. So again, that helps them adapt and transit to those types of production  
**[0:27:24-0:27:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:27:24):**  methods.  
**[0:27:25-0:27:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:27:25):**  And what's the vision for that landscape or where does the landscape could go to or tends  
**[0:27:31-0:27:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:27:31):**  towards like it's very hot as you described, it's very arid, but there's also water in  
**[0:27:36-0:27:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:27:36):**  limited time, not necessarily quantity. So where do you see that going to? What does  
**[0:27:41-0:27:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:27:41):**  this design? A lot of extra trees, agroforestry systems, different grazing and vegetables.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:27:47):**  What do you see that landscape, the potential in five, 10, 15 years?  
**[0:27:51-0:27:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:27:51):**  Yeah, it's a mixture of all those things you described. It's agroforestry systems, it's  
**[0:27:56-0:28:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:27:56):**  integrated grazing, it's reintroducing the complexity back into the system because that  
**[0:28:05-0:28:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:28:05):**  then is a big safety net for resilience going into the future. So it has several purposes,  
**[0:28:12-0:28:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:28:12):**  regenerative agriculture in that part of the world. It's of course a food production, resilient  
**[0:28:16-0:28:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:28:16):**  food production as we go into the future, livelihood regeneration as well. It's also  
**[0:28:22-0:28:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:28:22):**  useful to stop the Sahara Desert coming further south, like the Great Green Wall project.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:28:28):**  We're contributing to that and seeing how farming communities with regenerative agriculture  
**[0:28:33-0:28:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:28:33):**  can kind of plug a few gaps here and there. It's about also working with farmers that  
**[0:28:40-0:28:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:28:40):**  farm around biodiverse areas which are under pressure. So in that part of the world, there  
**[0:28:47-0:28:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:28:47):**  are several river valleys, wetland areas that farming inevitably encroaches onto as farmers  
**[0:28:55-0:29:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:28:55):**  seek more productive area. But if we can work with what's called a jurisdictional approach,  
**[0:29:03-0:29:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:29:03):**  so we work with all the area including the biodiverse areas, so those are conserved and  
**[0:29:10-0:29:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:29:10):**  regenerated but also the farming areas are regenerated so there's less pressure on those  
**[0:29:17-0:29:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:29:17):**  very important biodiverse areas. So then we've encapsulated all the area, we're able to increase  
**[0:29:25-0:29:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:29:25):**  food production, revenues from that increase, but then it also lines the whole communities  
**[0:29:30-0:29:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:29:30):**  up for complementary revenue streams like carbon credits or biodiversity credits. There's  
**[0:29:38-0:29:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:29:38):**  a whole raft of these things coming up now which can only help and lift up and we're  
**[0:29:43-0:29:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:29:43):**  getting a lot of interest from finance providers that deliver climate solutions. So these big  
**[0:29:50-0:29:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:29:50):**  projects are of interest because they can pour a lot of climate finance funding into  
**[0:29:55-0:30:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:29:55):**  it and in return, conserve biodiverse areas, help local farmer livelihoods. It's just a  
**[0:30:03-0:30:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:30:03):**  great package we can offer.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:30:05):**  And so with the design, I wouldn't say done, but let's say the first design done and even  
**[0:30:11-0:30:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:30:11):**  down to the level of what tree species, what's the next step? When is planting beginning  
**[0:30:16-0:30:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:30:16):**  or what's the implementation look like? Or do you see, okay, we actually need a few more  
**[0:30:21-0:30:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:30:21):**  versions of the software and of the algorithms before we are down to the point that we can  
**[0:30:26-0:30:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:30:26):**  say, okay, here we need to plant, so let's go. Or like, what do you see there currently  
**[0:30:31-0:30:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:30:31):**  and what are the next steps there?  
**[0:30:33-0:30:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:30:33):**  Yeah, well, ultimately with farming at some point, somebody's got to go into a field and  
**[0:30:38-0:30:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:30:38):**  do something. So in essence, essentially the technological artificial intelligence enabled  
**[0:30:47-0:30:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:30:47):**  designs the easy bit. It's accurately costed, planned down to the minutest detail. The next  
**[0:30:55-0:31:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:30:55):**  step we've got is to continue our technology development, but we're already getting this  
**[0:31:01-0:31:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:31:01):**  first project financed. So the design is important. The finance to make it work is important.  
**[0:31:08-0:31:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:31:08):**  And you see the design as a key point to, I wouldn't say convince, but to get especially  
**[0:31:14-0:31:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:31:14):**  larger scale projects off the ground, you need to make it, yes, to simulate it, to make  
**[0:31:19-0:31:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:31:19):**  it visible what could happen. Because otherwise we always talk about yeoman and key lines,  
**[0:31:25-0:31:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:31:25):**  et cetera, but for large financial institutions or large investors, that just doesn't, doesn't  
**[0:31:30-0:31:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:31:30):**  convince too much.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:31:32):**  No, no. And the simulation is really important because we're talking about improving things,  
**[0:31:40-0:31:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:31:40):**  creating impact, regenerating natural capital. We're making big claims here. So in order  
**[0:31:47-0:31:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:31:47):**  to be able to substantiate those claims, we have to be able to measure and monitor and  
**[0:31:51-0:31:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:31:51):**  prove with data that we've gone from this level to this level, which is better. And  
**[0:31:58-0:32:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:31:58):**  it's really essential to do that. We're not, we're not providing a generic model here that,  
**[0:32:03-0:32:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:32:03):**  oh, if you try this, something like this might happen. We're actually designing a location  
**[0:32:10-0:32:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:32:10):**  based specific design and then measuring and monitoring that and also monetizing it at  
**[0:32:17-0:32:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:32:17):**  the end. So data and measurement throughout that from a financial perspective, from an  
**[0:32:23-0:32:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:32:23):**  ecological regeneration perspective, even down to things like if we're claiming that  
**[0:32:30-0:32:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:32:30):**  livelihoods are better and more jobs are created, tracking that. So people can really convince  
**[0:32:37-0:32:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:32:37):**  these people if you can show them the hard numbers that, yeah, we've had some impact  
**[0:32:42-0:32:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:32:42):**  here and let's try and do that on another area and another area. And so the whole thing  
**[0:32:48-0:32:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:32:48):**  can replicate and expand. And that's where I think the power of our tool really works  
**[0:32:54-0:32:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:32:54):**  because we can, we can say, okay, we've done 10,000 hectares here. If we were to translate  
**[0:32:59-0:33:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:32:59):**  that into 1 million hectares, what would that be like? What would that mean? Yeah. And do  
**[0:33:05-0:33:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:33:05):**  you see the interest now from the finance world to work on this specific one? Is that  
**[0:33:10-0:33:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:33:10):**  the phase where you're in now? Like, okay, how do we actually get into the field and  
**[0:33:15-0:33:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:33:15):**  get going? And how do we finance that? Or is it something that's on the side of the  
**[0:33:18-0:33:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:33:18):**  client at a farm and a family and a person from they have for sure connections to the  
**[0:33:23-0:33:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:33:23):**  finance world if they're processing at that scale? Like what's holding you back now to  
**[0:33:27-0:33:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:33:27):**  implement the 10,000 hectares? Well, we're not sort of handing over the design to them  
**[0:33:32-0:33:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:33:32):**  and saying, there you go. Thanks very much. We're off. No, we can order the trees. Yes,  
**[0:33:37-0:33:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:33:37):**  yes. Now we're involved in the next phase of implementation and actual project development  
**[0:33:42-0:33:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:33:42):**  because if we can stay with the project throughout its inception and getting into a mature phase,  
**[0:33:51-0:33:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:33:51):**  what's important for us is to stick with it and of course, make sure it's delivered correctly,  
**[0:33:56-0:34:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:33:56):**  but also to get data from the project itself and feedback into our algorithm so it sharpens  
**[0:34:05-0:34:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:34:05):**  up, we can learn from it and that therefore the designs in other places are more accurate.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:34:11):**  So for us, it's a long term engagement. And of course, if you're selling any carbon credits  
**[0:34:17-0:34:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:34:17):**  from that project, it's important to be able to measure those every year and report on  
**[0:34:25-0:34:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:34:25):**  that. Otherwise, you've got to give all the money back. So it's not what we want to do.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:34:31):**  It's quite an essential, also to invest it. If people have, I don't know, supported a  
**[0:34:35-0:34:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:34:35):**  green bond for invested in the green bond for large scale landscape regeneration, you  
**[0:34:41-0:34:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:34:41):**  want some kind of reporting and some kind of it's not enough just to have the simulation  
**[0:34:46-0:34:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:34:46):**  and to have the nicely rendered simulation where you can wear your VR glasses and see  
**[0:34:51-0:34:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:34:51):**  how it might look. It's nice at some point to have the actual growth rate of the trees  
**[0:34:56-0:35:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:34:56):**  and to have the rain infiltration rates and things like that to actually back up.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:35:00):**  I think it's essential because you've entered into a financial transaction with a buyer.  
**[0:35:06-0:35:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:35:06):**  And if I was buying these credits, I'm going, well, what am I actually buying here? Is this  
**[0:35:12-0:35:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:35:12):**  a bit of greenwash I can tell my shareholders or have I actually bought sequestered carbon  
**[0:35:21-0:35:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:35:21):**  or water credit or a biodiversity net grain credit? I want to be able to say, okay, it's  
**[0:35:26-0:35:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:35:26):**  gone from here to here. It's actually real. There are the independent measurements. I  
**[0:35:32-0:35:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:35:32):**  feel comfortable and excited by my purchase and I want to buy some more. And that's where  
**[0:35:37-0:35:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:35:37):**  we want to set up everybody for.  
**[0:35:40-0:35:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:35:40):**  And from the technology perspective, having made that, I wouldn't say the jump, but definitely  
**[0:35:45-0:35:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:35:45):**  the step from singing at the campfire and permaculture or walking the land, walking  
**[0:35:50-0:35:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:35:50):**  it personally and now involving a lot of tech. What do you feel that is still missing to,  
**[0:35:56-0:36:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:35:56):**  if anything on the tech side to get regenerative ag to a regeneration to a landscape level?  
**[0:36:02-0:36:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:36:02):**  For us as a business, it's data and the availability and affordability of data. If we can get access  
**[0:36:10-0:36:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:36:10):**  to that, it kind of opens up areas.  
**[0:36:13-0:36:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:36:13):**  And data meaning what deep land actually looks like to see that into the algorithm.  
**[0:36:17-0:36:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:36:17):**  Yeah, it's high resolution stuff and it's partly available by satellite, but that's  
**[0:36:22-0:36:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:36:22):**  expensive. We can partly acquire it through commercial drones who have like a heavy payload  
**[0:36:31-0:36:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:36:31):**  and good cameras. And so we can take a lot of data, a lot of photogrammetry images from  
**[0:36:36-0:36:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:36:36):**  that.  
**[0:36:37-0:36:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:36:37):**  But going forward, if we could do this at scale and measure things accurately at scale,  
**[0:36:46-0:36:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:36:46):**  particularly carbon sequestration or water flows or ecological functioning in general,  
**[0:36:53-0:37:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:36:53):**  it's the data, it's the cost of that data. So we can really put it through our algorithms  
**[0:37:00-0:37:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:37:00):**  and machine learning tools. So it's not just wild claims we're making, it's actually how  
**[0:37:06-0:37:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:37:06):**  the landscape is functioning. And I think that's a very exciting area, not for us, just  
**[0:37:11-0:37:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:37:11):**  us to get involved with, but agrotech in general, in that we have a whole world to map here  
**[0:37:17-0:37:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:37:17):**  and understand better.  
**[0:37:19-0:37:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:37:19):**  It's rather like all the data points that are taken from us on social media to understand  
**[0:37:25-0:37:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:37:25):**  our behavior. And it's done very cleverly. But let's try and do that to figure out how  
**[0:37:32-0:37:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:37:32):**  a landscape functions. And so we can know if that landscape is in trouble or it's regenerating  
**[0:37:38-0:37:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:37:38):**  or degenerating. Let's have all those data points in the landscape so we can come up  
**[0:37:43-0:37:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:37:43):**  with a better design. We can embrace those natural systems and then make them work in  
**[0:37:50-0:37:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:37:50):**  our favor. We're part of it. We should be part in understanding how the ecosystem works  
**[0:37:55-0:38:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:37:55):**  because we are part of it. And the data to understand that really needs to develop a  
**[0:38:01-0:38:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:38:01):**  lot more. And we're excited to be part of the sector, just designing a little bit of  
**[0:38:05-0:38:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:38:05):**  it. It's very fulfilling.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:38:07):**  And you're saying that basically when it comes to soil on the landscape scale, but also soil  
**[0:38:13-0:38:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:38:13):**  on a farm scale, there's very little we know how it behaves and how it could behave and  
**[0:38:19-0:38:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:38:19):**  how water could move on a landscape, unless you are a landscape whisperer. There's actually,  
**[0:38:24-0:38:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:38:24):**  it's an enormous gray area or enormous unknown area where we're moving into to start discussing  
**[0:38:30-0:38:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:38:30):**  how to design as we have done, but in a very destructive way, landscapes to move on the  
**[0:38:38-0:38:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:38:38):**  regenerative continuum to start making steps forward and to understand water flows, biodiversity  
**[0:38:43-0:38:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:38:43):**  flows, animal flows, plant flows and all of that. And it's, but you're saying we're very,  
**[0:38:48-0:38:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:38:48):**  very, very early on that. And there's some satellite data, but not accurate enough. And  
**[0:38:52-0:38:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:38:52):**  there's a lot of other data that we actually have in biodiversity data on most of the world.  
**[0:38:57-0:39:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:38:57):**  Yeah, exactly. I think, you know, after the second world war, we, that pushed to produce  
**[0:39:04-0:39:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:39:04):**  more food and narrow down the factors you had to consider to produce food so you could  
**[0:39:12-0:39:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:39:12):**  manage them closely. Seeds, fertilizer, pesticides, insecticides, machinery, the enterprises which  
**[0:39:21-0:39:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:39:21):**  were developed just had five or six factors to consider and try and push nature out of  
**[0:39:26-0:39:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:39:26):**  the way so we can measure how much seed, measure how much fertilizer and look what's happened.  
**[0:39:32-0:39:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:39:32):**  It's been a, yeah, we produced a lot more food, but at what cost? So if we look at it  
**[0:39:38-0:39:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:39:38):**  through a different lens, all those natural processes and systems that operate in the  
**[0:39:45-0:39:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:39:45):**  landscape, the nitrogen cycle, the carbon cycle, all those soil web systems, you know,  
**[0:39:52-0:39:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:39:52):**  biological chemical, we don't really know a lot about them and it's going to take more  
**[0:39:59-0:40:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:39:59):**  than our lifetimes to find out about them. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't trust them.  
**[0:40:07-0:40:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:40:07):**  And so if we encourage those natural systems to come back and use them, I like to think  
**[0:40:13-0:40:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:40:13):**  we use them as part of the team, part of the farm management team. We don't understand  
**[0:40:19-0:40:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:40:19):**  how they work.  
**[0:40:20-0:40:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:40:20):**  Exactly. But they do their job. So who cares?  
**[0:40:24-0:40:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:40:24):**  And importantly, from a farm business point of view, they are free and will never fail.  
**[0:40:31-0:40:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:40:31):**  So having those guys as part of your team, that's a wonderful thing to have. It's a big  
**[0:40:36-0:40:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:40:36):**  safety net, I think. So encouraging them to work continuously 24 seven without a break  
**[0:40:43-0:40:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:40:43):**  for free and helping you. Why wouldn't you?  
**[0:40:48-0:40:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:40:48):**  And if you could change one thing in the food and agriculture system, you had a magic wand  
**[0:40:53-0:40:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:40:53):**  and you have a magic power. What would that be?  
**[0:40:56-0:41:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:40:56):**  I think I'd like to open up people's minds and take the blinkers off a bit.  
**[0:41:04-0:41:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:41:04):**  Which one specifically?  
**[0:41:05-0:41:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:41:05):**  There's not just one. It's just the question of taking the blinkers on because I think  
**[0:41:10-0:41:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:41:10):**  people have fear of change. And it is not just in farming, but in life in general, that  
**[0:41:17-0:41:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:41:17):**  fear of change. But what we'd like to do is present to those people who are reluctant  
**[0:41:23-0:41:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:41:23):**  to point their farm businesses down the regenerative path. Let's have a look. Let's give you some  
**[0:41:28-0:41:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:41:28):**  examples of where it's worked. Let's simulate what might happen on your farm so you're more  
**[0:41:33-0:41:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:41:33):**  comfortable. And then there's a few stepping stones.  
**[0:41:36-0:41:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:41:36):**  Because then when it's on your farm, I know in a pre-interview you mentioned that you're  
**[0:41:40-0:41:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:41:40):**  working in this specific project in Nigeria also basically with VR glasses to be able  
**[0:41:45-0:41:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:41:45):**  to see how a landscape could look like. And then suddenly if it's on your land or the  
**[0:41:50-0:41:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:41:50):**  land you know and you could see what it potentially is, do you think that will open up people's  
**[0:41:56-0:42:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:41:56):**  mind to it? Or then it's like, no, that's too radical. We could never work here, even  
**[0:42:00-0:42:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:42:00):**  though I saw that the neighbor or down the street a lot further. But do you see it on  
**[0:42:05-0:42:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:42:05):**  if it's on their land? Is that a potential trigger point?  
**[0:42:08-0:42:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:42:08):**  I think so. And it's one of the trigger points as a farming business that's in trouble gets  
**[0:42:14-0:42:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:42:14):**  further and further to the kind of hitting the brick wall. If we can show them this,  
**[0:42:20-0:42:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:42:20):**  okay, here's what it would look like. Put the goggles on and see how your farm might  
**[0:42:24-0:42:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:42:24):**  look going into the future. There's a light at the end of the tunnel. And I think it's  
**[0:42:28-0:42:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:42:28):**  to do as well with succession issues on the farm. As the older generation come towards  
**[0:42:36-0:42:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:42:36):**  retirement, they're passing the responsibility on to the sons and daughters. The sons and  
**[0:42:41-0:42:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:42:41):**  daughters are going, like, great, but oh my goodness, we're in trouble. We've got to do  
**[0:42:46-0:42:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:42:46):**  a turnaround. So enabling them with technology. And I noticed really, when I walk around a  
**[0:42:55-0:43:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:42:55):**  farm, you know, you do a farm visit and the family usually walks with you, the older generation  
**[0:43:01-0:43:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:43:01):**  talking, but the younger generation usually have an iPad or an iPhone in their back pocket.  
**[0:43:07-0:43:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:43:07):**  And so, yeah, of course, taking the family unit as a whole, but really focusing the future  
**[0:43:13-0:43:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:43:13):**  on that younger generation who don't mind going on and simulating and visualizing and  
**[0:43:19-0:43:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:43:19):**  putting the goggles on because it's their responsibility for the future. So it's that  
**[0:43:24-0:43:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:43:24):**  point of connection with that younger generation that's really making things come alive. Not  
**[0:43:30-0:43:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:43:30):**  just in Nigeria, but here in the UK where we're based. Again, those family farms who  
**[0:43:36-0:43:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:43:36):**  are struggling a bit. Looking at these new government schemes coming out, how do we get  
**[0:43:41-0:43:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:43:41):**  involved with that? What about technology? It's kind of a very fertile area to explore  
**[0:43:47-0:43:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:43:47):**  with them. So that's what I, we don't necessarily, it's not what I change. I think that's what  
**[0:43:52-0:43:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:43:52):**  is changing at the moment. And we're in a good spot to help out as much as we can.  
**[0:43:59-0:44:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:43:59):**  What would happen if you would be in charge of a relatively large investment fund? So  
**[0:44:04-0:44:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:44:04):**  it has a long, it could have a long investment horizon. It doesn't have to be a 10 year or  
**[0:44:09-0:44:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:44:09):**  whatever fund, but it has to be invested. Let's say you have a billion dollars or a  
**[0:44:12-0:44:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:44:12):**  billion pounds sterling to be invested. What would you focus on? I'm not saying down to  
**[0:44:17-0:44:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:44:17):**  the dollar. I'm curious what your priorities would be if you had these kind of assets under  
**[0:44:23-0:44:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:44:23):**  management to put to work.  
**[0:44:24-0:44:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:44:24):**  It's a nice thought to have, isn't it? And we're, hopefully we're heading down. It's  
**[0:44:28-0:44:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:44:28):**  a burden as well. Yeah. It's a tremendous responsibility, but you know, I'd think of  
**[0:44:33-0:44:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:44:33):**  myself as being in a very fortunate position, like a great artist being commissioned to  
**[0:44:42-0:44:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:44:42):**  produce a masterpiece. But that masterpiece is a living, breathing, natural asset or a  
**[0:44:53-0:45:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:44:53):**  portfolio of assets that has to perform financially. But also we have to educate and enable the  
**[0:45:04-0:45:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:45:04):**  realization that these assets perform in several other ways alongside being financially profitable.  
**[0:45:15-0:45:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:45:15):**  Again, that's kind of a more artistic way of describing it. But if we look at that holistic  
**[0:45:22-0:45:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:45:22):**  picture, we are getting the most from our farms, from our rural assets. And I think  
**[0:45:31-0:45:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:45:31):**  now certainly some of the large institutional investors we're talking to are widening their  
**[0:45:39-0:45:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:45:39):**  thinking. We had to start with describing how a farm would behave as if it were an office  
**[0:45:48-0:45:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:45:48):**  block and you know, real estate.  
**[0:45:52-0:45:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:45:52):**  Yeah. Change some light bulbs, put a solar panel on the roof.  
**[0:45:55-0:45:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:45:55):**  Yeah. How much can you rent it out for a square foot? That kind of thing. Well, yeah, you  
**[0:45:59-0:46:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:45:59):**  can describe a farm that way to engage first of all, but then we've been widening out the  
**[0:46:06-0:46:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:46:06):**  conversation. And interestingly, some investors we spoke to, they got all that and we thought,  
**[0:46:12-0:46:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:46:12):**  okay, well, we've been speaking about natural capital regeneration and all the different  
**[0:46:17-0:46:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:46:17):**  revenue streams you can get on there and the returns per year are acceptable for their  
**[0:46:25-0:46:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:46:25):**  investors as well. So that was all good. And then interesting, they come back to us with  
**[0:46:29-0:46:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:46:29):**  actually what they're really interested in. And it's different depending on who you talk  
**[0:46:34-0:46:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:46:34):**  to. And one of them said, well, we're really interested in these farm assets, as they call  
**[0:46:43-0:46:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:46:43):**  them, providing a vehicle for new entrants into the farming industry. We get all the  
**[0:46:50-0:46:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:46:50):**  financial stuff, the natural capital stuff, all that, but it's how do we...  
**[0:46:55-0:46:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:46:55):**  Generation transition. Could be that sons and daughters could be completely new people  
**[0:46:59-0:47:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:46:59):**  entering because there are a lot actually access to land for many aspiring farmers using  
**[0:47:05-0:47:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:47:05):**  regenerative practices is very, very, very difficult because they often, unless you inherit  
**[0:47:09-0:47:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:47:09):**  it, it's very difficult in many places to get your hands on a sufficient scale piece  
**[0:47:15-0:47:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:47:15):**  of land to do any farming. And of course you can rent it and that's it, but there's the  
**[0:47:19-0:47:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:47:19):**  land access and land ownership piece is a very big one.  
**[0:47:22-0:47:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:47:22):**  And I think these issues aren't new. If you've read Thoreau's book, Walden, I mean, back  
**[0:47:28-0:47:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:47:28):**  in the 1850s, these issues were there. It's how do farmers work all their life to pay  
**[0:47:34-0:47:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:47:34):**  off the mortgage to own the farm and then what? We're still there. And so if we can  
**[0:47:39-0:47:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:47:39):**  work in this new urgent era of climate change and have the landscape as a potential solution  
**[0:47:49-0:47:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:47:49):**  for that and take the issue of I have to own the farm in order to be able to contribute  
**[0:47:56-0:48:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:47:56):**  and have a career, if this farmland can somehow be held in long-term trust and the investors  
**[0:48:04-0:48:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:48:04):**  are getting there, they're all happy, but it removes the hurdles and the huge cash needs  
**[0:48:12-0:48:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:48:12):**  and loan needs and mortgage needs to buy and the burden going forward of, gosh, I've got  
**[0:48:16-0:48:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:48:16):**  a, how much do I owe this month to pay off? Let's remove that. Let's focus on the farming.  
**[0:48:21-0:48:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:48:21):**  Let's focus on the soil. Let's focus on the water and let the people that are really focused  
**[0:48:27-0:48:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:48:27):**  on that financial asset management do that. And we're in the middle trying to help the  
**[0:48:34-0:48:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:48:34):**  process, help with the management, help manage those assets in a profitable and productive  
**[0:48:41-0:48:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:48:41):**  way, but also solve that food production resilience issue as well.  
**[0:48:47-0:48:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:48:47):**  And as a final question, where are you contrarian in the sector, in the RegenX sector? What  
**[0:48:52-0:48:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:48:52):**  do you believe to be true about regenerative agriculture and food that others don't? Definitely  
**[0:48:57-0:49:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:48:57):**  inspired by the question Joan Kemp always asks, if you are somewhere contrarian.  
**[0:49:02-0:49:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:49:02):**  Well, you know, there's always a few naysayers in any point in life. I believe regenerative  
**[0:49:09-0:49:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:49:09):**  agriculture to be more productive and profitable. It's difficult to prove that sometimes because  
**[0:49:16-0:49:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:49:16):**  we don't have farm data on regenerative agriculture farms going back 30 years. We have some excellent  
**[0:49:25-0:49:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:49:25):**  examples though that are doing very well now. So I believe absolutely that to be true. I  
**[0:49:33-0:49:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:49:33):**  also believe that coming back to the issue of change and farmers and reluctance, nervousness,  
**[0:49:42-0:49:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:49:42):**  I also believe that a farmer once said to me, the most difficult thing to change in  
**[0:49:50-0:49:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:49:50):**  a farmer is the field between his ears. It's that if we can change mindsets, then everything  
**[0:49:57-0:50:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:49:57):**  starts to flow from there. Sometimes these farmers are in deep financial and personal  
**[0:50:04-0:50:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:50:04):**  crisis. And so if we can just provide a small light at the end of the tunnel to say, give  
**[0:50:11-0:50:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:50:11):**  this a go, it will probably work. But let's go that together. That kind of coming back  
**[0:50:18-0:50:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:50:18):**  to those eight ingredients of agriculture, people, they're further down the track, but  
**[0:50:23-0:50:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:50:23):**  they're absolutely essential to make it work. So without that, you know, natural systems  
**[0:50:28-0:50:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:50:28):**  operate, but the person factor, the people factor in this are critical to have motivated  
**[0:50:36-0:50:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:50:36):**  people understand enabled by technology so we can get there quicker and at scale, I think.  
**[0:50:42-0:50:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:50:42):**  I always say last question and it never is, but what is on the roll for like after this  
**[0:50:47-0:50:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:50:47):**  design, are you working on any other places, exciting designs? I'm imagining quite a few  
**[0:50:53-0:50:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:50:53):**  people reached out after you published it on LinkedIn. I would definitely link the article  
**[0:50:56-0:51:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:50:56):**  below in the show notes. What is planned for other designs at other places, other circumstances  
**[0:51:02-0:51:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:51:02):**  and conflicts?  
**[0:51:03-0:51:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:51:03):**  Yeah, yeah, we're getting contacted daily from all the way around the world, but our  
**[0:51:07-0:51:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:51:07):**  focus for the next few years is in Nigeria and other countries in Africa doing similar  
**[0:51:13-0:51:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:51:13):**  types of projects, larger landscapes, but in Africa, smaller individual farmers grouped  
**[0:51:21-0:51:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:51:21):**  aggregated together. We have some really interesting opportunities in Central Asia where the dynamics  
**[0:51:28-0:51:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:51:28):**  are totally different, massive landscapes, but very small numbers of farmers and really  
**[0:51:36-0:51:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:51:36):**  lots of abandoned land, if you like, or land just left there not being productive. And  
**[0:51:42-0:51:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:51:42):**  so that's kind of a blank slate for us to design something that's really, really good  
**[0:51:50-0:51:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:51:50):**  and efficient. And of course, back at work, we're based back in the UK, this whole...  
**[0:51:55-0:52:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:51:55):**  You're using the design software as well. It works in different climates, let's say,  
**[0:52:00-0:52:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:52:00):**  as well. It works in the UK.  
**[0:52:02-0:52:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:52:02):**  Yeah, and that's going back to the importance of data, getting data from the specific location  
**[0:52:06-0:52:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:52:06):**  you're working with. So yeah, Central Asian environments, huge, massive, Northern Nigeria,  
**[0:52:12-0:52:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:52:12):**  yes, but small farmers. And back in the UK, where we're starting to get a lot of traction  
**[0:52:18-0:52:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:52:18):**  is by family farmers who are really, like I said, up against it, need to change direction,  
**[0:52:25-0:52:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:52:25):**  but also from institutional clients like water companies who say, how can we engage farmers  
**[0:52:32-0:52:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:52:32):**  to solve one of our problems like nitrate runoff or whatever it is? So those clients  
**[0:52:37-0:52:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:52:37):**  are really getting interested. Yeah. So the technology works in all these different places  
**[0:52:42-0:52:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:52:42):**  for different people.  
**[0:52:43-0:52:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:52:43):**  As long as the data is good and detailed.  
**[0:52:45-0:52:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:52:45):**  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  
**[0:52:46-0:52:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:52:46):**  I want to thank you so much, Jason, for sharing, opening up and this conversation. And I will  
**[0:52:52-0:52:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:52:52):**  be checking in, I always say that, but I really will, to follow this piece along and follow  
**[0:52:57-0:53:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:52:57):**  the different projects you're involved in. And of course, the technology that is still  
**[0:53:01-0:53:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:53:01):**  being developed and will never be finished.  
**[0:53:03-0:53:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/jason-hayward-jones#t=0:53:03):**  Thank you very much. It's been a pleasure. Thank you.

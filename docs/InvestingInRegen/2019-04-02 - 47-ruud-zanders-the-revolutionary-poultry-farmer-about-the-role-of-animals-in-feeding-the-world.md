**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:00:14):**  In this interview we explore the role of animals in feeding the world.  
**[0:00:17-0:00:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:00:17):**  I interview the Dutch poultry farmer Ruud who argues the importance of asking why constantly.  
**[0:00:24-0:00:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:00:24):**  For instance, why are we feeding food which humans could eat directly, mostly grain, cereals  
**[0:00:29-0:00:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:00:29):**  and corn, to animals?  
**[0:00:31-0:00:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:00:31):**  Enjoy this wide-ranging discussion on animal agriculture, the future of food and veganism.  
**[0:00:39-0:00:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:00:39):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture.  
**[0:00:43-0:00:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:00:43):**  Investing as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:00:45):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:49-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:00:49):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:00:54-0:00:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:00:54):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:00:59):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:01-0:01:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:01:01):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:05-0:01:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:01:05):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:08-0:01:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:01:08):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:12-0:01:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:01:12):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:01:17):**  Before we get started, I've been recording these interviews next to my day job and I  
**[0:01:21-0:01:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:01:21):**  will definitely continue to do so and release about an episode a month.  
**[0:01:25-0:01:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:01:25):**  But at the same time I would love to take this further, share more interviews, there  
**[0:01:29-0:01:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:01:29):**  are many more stories to share on investing in regenerative food and agriculture.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:01:33):**  More depth, improve the quality, maybe even doing some video series.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:01:38):**  So I started a Patreon community which makes it easy to support creators like myself.

**[0:01:54-0:01:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:01:54):**  And now, without further ado, the interview.  
**[0:01:58-0:01:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:01:58):**  Enjoy!  
**[0:01:59-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:01:59):**  Welcome to another episode of the podcast.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:02:00):**  I'm Koen van Zijn, your host, and today I have the pleasure to interview Ruud Zanders,  
**[0:02:04-0:02:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:02:04):**  co-founder of Kipster, a beyond organic chicken and egg farmer in the Netherlands.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:02:08):**  Welcome Ruud!  
**[0:02:09-0:02:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:02:09):**  Yeah, thank you.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:02:10):**  To start with a personal question, what brings you to start a beyond organic, as I quoted  
**[0:02:15-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:02:15):**  the Guardian here, which I will definitely put in the show notes below, to start a beyond  
**[0:02:20-0:02:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:02:20):**  organic or beyond free range chicken and egg farmer in the Netherlands?  
**[0:02:24-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:02:24):**  What brings you there?  
**[0:02:25-0:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:02:25):**  Yeah, I grew up on a poultry farm, so my parents, they were poultry farmers.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:02:31):**  And when they had a layer farm, it was actually to look how can we make as much eggs as possible  
**[0:02:37-0:02:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:02:37):**  and that for the lowest cost.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:02:38):**  So large scale and large scale.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:02:41):**  And about 10 years ago, I was thinking, is this the way we have to go with animal products?  
**[0:02:47-0:02:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:02:47):**  So is there not a way to have a look how can we make more animal protein, but that in an  
**[0:02:53-0:02:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:02:53):**  animal friendly and environment friendly and people friendly way?  
**[0:02:57-0:02:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:02:57):**  And that's how we started.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:02:59):**  And that's the reason why we want to do something different and to make better eggs or maybe  
**[0:03:04-0:03:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:03:04):**  the best egg in the world.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:03:06):**  Yeah, I think you're definitely underselling yourself when you're saying something different,  
**[0:03:10-0:03:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:03:10):**  because you're doing everything different.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:03:12):**  Can you describe a bit for someone who is not a poultry farmer, like probably most of  
**[0:03:16-0:03:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:03:16):**  the listeners, what is Kipster and what ways are you different?  
**[0:03:21-0:03:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:03:21):**  And then we'll dive a bit deeper into the animal protein discussion after that.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:03:24):**  Okay.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:03:25):**  Yeah.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:03:26):**  But what we did is first we have a look, what's the role of animals in feeding the  
**[0:03:31-0:03:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:03:31):**  world?  
**[0:03:32-0:03:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:03:32):**  Why should we produce animal protein?  
**[0:03:35-0:03:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:03:35):**  Because for example, we have one kilogram of cereals and you can feed 10 people with  
**[0:03:40-0:03:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:03:40):**  it.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:03:41):**  But what we are doing in the rich west, we are giving that one kilogram of cereals to  
**[0:03:46-0:03:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:03:46):**  animals.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:03:47):**  And then you can feed in an inefficient way.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:03:49):**  You can feed two to four people with it instead of 10 people.  
**[0:03:54-0:03:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:03:54):**  So why are we doing that?  
**[0:03:56-0:04:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:03:56):**  Is that ethical to give all this good cereals and corn to animals knowing that one billion  
**[0:04:03-0:04:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:04:03):**  people in the world are hungry?  
**[0:04:04-0:04:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:04:04):**  So what's the logical reason for that?  
**[0:04:06-0:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:04:06):**  So we were looking for that logical reason and we couldn't find it.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:04:10):**  So we went to Wageningen University.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:04:12):**  What's the reason to produce animal products?  
**[0:04:15-0:04:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:04:15):**  And then there was a good theory, we think.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:04:19):**  It was a theory from Professor M.K.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:04:21):**  de Boer.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:04:22):**  And what he was saying to us is the role of animals in feeding the world is that we have  
**[0:04:26-0:04:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:04:26):**  to produce with all the arable land which we have in the world, we have to produce plant-based  
**[0:04:32-0:04:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:04:32):**  products for people, and then we have some marginal land in the world where nothing else  
**[0:04:38-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:04:38):**  is growing than grass.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:04:39):**  You can put a cow or goat in it and you can make food from that grass with a cow or a  
**[0:04:45-0:04:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:04:45):**  goat.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:04:46):**  And then you have some west products from plant-based production from the land and you  
**[0:04:51-0:04:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:04:51):**  have some west products for human consumption.  
**[0:04:54-0:04:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:04:54):**  And then a pig and a chicken can do something fantastic because they can eat that and they  
**[0:04:59-0:05:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:04:59):**  can make food for people from that.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:05:01):**  And that's the role of animals in feeding the world.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:05:05):**  Only eating our west products and they can make food for people from products which we  
**[0:05:12-0:05:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:05:12):**  can't use anymore.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:05:14):**  So we said, okay, that's the role of animals in feeding the world.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:05:17):**  That's the reason why we should use as human being, why we should use animals for our human  
**[0:05:24-0:05:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:05:24):**  beings.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:05:25):**  And if you are using these animals, then do that in an animal-friendly and people-friendly  
**[0:05:30-0:05:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:05:30):**  and environment-friendly way as good as possible.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:05:34):**  And that's exactly what we are doing with Gibbs.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:05:36):**  So we are only feeding our animals with west products from human consumption and from the  
**[0:05:41-0:05:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:05:41):**  land.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:05:42):**  And I really believe that we are the only ones in the world who are doing that in a  
**[0:05:46-0:05:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:05:46):**  commercial way with laying hands.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:05:49):**  And that's the role of animals.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:05:51):**  That's what we are doing.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:05:52):**  And then you have a lot of other things you have to take care of, and that's for animal  
**[0:05:56-0:05:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:05:56):**  welfare.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:05:57):**  We have three stars from the Dutch animal protection.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:06:00):**  We do that as good as possible, but we are also catching the finest out of the air so  
**[0:06:05-0:06:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:06:05):**  that we have no risk for the public health.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:06:09):**  We have also transparency to all the people who want to know what we are doing because  
**[0:06:14-0:06:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:06:14):**  we are always open for visitors.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:06:16):**  We are also using the west products from an egg.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:06:20):**  And the west products from producing an egg is the manure, the laying hands when they  
**[0:06:25-0:06:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:06:25):**  are too old to lay eggs so you can make meat from it and roosters because the roosters  
**[0:06:30-0:06:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:06:30):**  normally they are gassed at day one.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:06:33):**  But we say no, we think that's not ethical to do that.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:06:36):**  So we want to make meat from it.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:06:39):**  And last but not least, we are making a climate neutral egg.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:06:44):**  So these are all the things what we are doing.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:06:48):**  There's so much to unpack, but I think the central theme is there to unpack literally  
**[0:06:52-0:06:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:06:52):**  in eggs obviously, but unpack in your story as well.  
**[0:06:55-0:06:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:06:55):**  The central theme is what's the role?  
**[0:06:58-0:07:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:06:58):**  And I think you went completely back to the basics.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:07:00):**  What's the role?  
**[0:07:01-0:07:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:07:01):**  Do we need animals?  
**[0:07:02-0:07:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:07:02):**  And if we need animals, what's their role in the food system of the future?  
**[0:07:07-0:07:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:07:07):**  And I wanted to ask about the meat part actually, because it's something that many people don't  
**[0:07:12-0:07:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:07:12):**  consider very often.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:07:13):**  First of all, the rooster part, because obviously half the chickens when they're born are not  
**[0:07:17-0:07:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:07:17):**  laying hands.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:07:18):**  And normally they're, like you mentioned, they're gassed immediately.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:07:21):**  And actually you're growing them a bit older and using them for meat as well.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:07:26):**  And then the second part is that you have a very central theme in your company.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:07:30):**  You're only, you're first selling and then producing.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:07:34):**  Can you explain a bit about your relationship with the little supermarket and how that first  
**[0:07:38-0:07:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:07:38):**  sales and then production worked also on the meat side?  
**[0:07:42-0:07:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:07:42):**  What we did, we were rethinking how can you produce an egg?  
**[0:07:46-0:07:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:07:46):**  So that's what I told them.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:07:47):**  But at that moment we thought, okay, with this we think we have the best lay of farm  
**[0:07:52-0:07:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:07:52):**  in the world.  
**[0:07:53-0:08:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:07:53):**  So we thought, but we cannot build this if we don't have sales for our eggs.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:08:01):**  So we went to all the supermarkets in the Netherlands and then the little supermarket,  
**[0:08:06-0:08:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:08:06):**  little was from the beginning, very enthusiastic about what we were saying.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:08:10):**  So but at one moment after a lot of discussions, they asked us, how can we help you to realize  
**[0:08:17-0:08:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:08:17):**  this so that we can really make this happen?  
**[0:08:20-0:08:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:08:20):**  And then we said, okay, for us it would be nice if somebody wants to buy our eggs.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:08:26):**  And that's exactly little was saying, and that's exactly, yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.  
**[0:08:31-0:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:08:31):**  So and little was saying, okay, and that's exactly what we can do.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:08:34):**  And we said, if we have no sales for our eggs or no guarantees, then it's not possible for  
**[0:08:39-0:08:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:08:39):**  us because then the risks are too high.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:08:41):**  So we discussed a lot and at the end of the discussion we concluded, okay, we can get  
**[0:08:46-0:08:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:08:46):**  a contract from little for five years that they for sure buy all our eggs and all our  
**[0:08:53-0:08:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:08:53):**  meat products from us.  
**[0:08:54-0:08:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:08:54):**  And that's for a good price.  
**[0:08:56-0:09:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:08:56):**  So we calculate our cost price, our margin, so and our sales price for a good price that  
**[0:09:00-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:09:00):**  we can really make this happen.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:09:02):**  And I think that's one of the big innovations in the agriculture sector, for sure in the  
**[0:09:07-0:09:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:09:07):**  egg sector, that we are cooperating with little and not only about price so that we only discuss  
**[0:09:15-0:09:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:09:15):**  about price, but we are really cooperating.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:09:17):**  How can we make the best egg in the world?  
**[0:09:20-0:09:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:09:20):**  What does it cost?  
**[0:09:21-0:09:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:09:21):**  And can you really buy it from us?  
**[0:09:23-0:09:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:09:23):**  So that's what we are doing with little and with our sales.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:09:28):**  And it seems like they're happy because if I read it correctly, you have one farm now  
**[0:09:31-0:09:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:09:31):**  and you're opening a second one with little again as a customer.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:09:35):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:09:36):**  We started with our farm.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:09:38):**  We opened our farm in September 2017.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:09:42):**  We had our first eggs delivered to little in October 2017.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:09:46):**  And really from the beginning, we were completely sold out with our eggs.  
**[0:09:51-0:09:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:09:51):**  So that was very nice for us, but also very nice for little.  
**[0:09:54-0:10:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:09:54):**  But there was one big thing because little don't want to say no to their customers.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:10:00):**  So and that was the reason that they say, OK, we see that it sells really good.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:10:05):**  So we believe there's also a space for a second one.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:10:09):**  So we are going to build a second one for the little in the Netherlands and then again  
**[0:10:14-0:10:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:10:14):**  with a contract for five years for that farm.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:10:17):**  And just in terms of two questions in terms of scale, just to give people an idea, how  
**[0:10:22-0:10:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:10:22):**  many laying hands do you have at the moment at your operating farm?  
**[0:10:27-0:10:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:10:27):**  We have 24000 birds in one hipster and maybe it seems a lot, but actually that's quite  
**[0:10:36-0:10:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:10:36):**  a little bit because an average a normal barn system in the Netherlands has about 70 to  
**[0:10:42-0:10:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:10:42):**  80 thousand birds and a normal organic farm has about 20000 birds.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:10:47):**  So we are almost the same as an organic farm.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:10:52):**  And actually, that's a great segue into a question there.  
**[0:10:55-0:11:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:10:55):**  What's the main difference between you guys and an organic farmer?  
**[0:11:00-0:11:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:11:00):**  Is that the feed?  
**[0:11:01-0:11:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:11:01):**  Are there other things as well?  
**[0:11:04-0:11:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:11:04):**  And what would you describe if I would be I would be in the little supermarket and looking  
**[0:11:07-0:11:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:11:07):**  at the egg options?  
**[0:11:09-0:11:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:11:09):**  I see you guys and I see an organic one and I see a conventional one.  
**[0:11:14-0:11:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:11:14):**  I think there are three things.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:11:16):**  One of the things is our free range, because for 24000 birds, an organic and a free range  
**[0:11:22-0:11:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:11:22):**  farm needs 10 hectares of land to let the birds walk on.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:11:27):**  And every poultry farmer can tell you that from that 10 hectares, for sure, they don't  
**[0:11:33-0:11:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:11:33):**  use nine till nine and a half hectares.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:11:35):**  So we said that that has nothing to do with sustainability and nothing to do with animal  
**[0:11:41-0:11:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:11:41):**  welfare because they don't use it.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:11:44):**  And there are some reasons why they don't use it.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:11:47):**  They are afraid for forks and for predators and they don't like rain.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:11:51):**  So we had another solution.  
**[0:11:53-0:11:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:11:53):**  Yes, free range is good for all the animals, also for birds.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:11:57):**  So we have space to walk outside, but not 10 hectares, so it's much lower.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:12:03):**  But with that, we cannot be an organic farm.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:12:06):**  That's the first reason.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:12:07):**  The second reason is maybe more important.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:12:11):**  And that's our feed, because we don't want to feed good cereals or good corn, which we  
**[0:12:16-0:12:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:12:16):**  can eat as human being.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:12:18):**  And that's also what organic normally is doing.  
**[0:12:21-0:12:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:12:21):**  They are giving the cereals and corn, but it's organic cereal and corn.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:12:25):**  So maybe that's a little bit better, but we can eat that as a human person and we don't  
**[0:12:29-0:12:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:12:29):**  want to do that.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:12:31):**  So we are only giving rest products to our birds.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:12:35):**  And then you can say, OK, but then your rest products has to be organic.  
**[0:12:39-0:12:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:12:39):**  Yeah, maybe that's true, but that's at the moment not possible because they are not separated,  
**[0:12:44-0:12:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:12:44):**  organic and normal rest products.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:12:47):**  So and that's the second reason.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:12:50):**  And the third difference between organic and what we are doing is that we are making a  
**[0:12:55-0:13:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:12:55):**  climate neutral act and that there are actually no farms at the moment who are doing that  
**[0:13:01-0:13:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:13:01):**  or this is bound or organic.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:13:04):**  So your main I mean, apart from these three points, the main one is why would you feed  
**[0:13:10-0:13:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:13:10):**  something that that we can perfectly well eat to an animal if it's not necessary?  
**[0:13:15-0:13:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:13:15):**  Because what happens now with the waste streams or the residual streams that you mix into  
**[0:13:20-0:13:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:13:20):**  or with a partner, you mix that into a poultry feed?  
**[0:13:23-0:13:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:13:23):**  What would happen if your chickens were not eating that?  
**[0:13:27-0:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:13:27):**  Then it would go to, how do we say that, to biomass or to energy.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:13:32):**  So yeah, so much lower.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:13:34):**  That's maybe also good.  
**[0:13:35-0:13:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:13:35):**  But if you look to the environment, what can we do to do the best with rest products?  
**[0:13:41-0:13:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:13:41):**  Then you have 10 steps.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:13:43):**  And the first step is prevention.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:13:45):**  Everybody knows that.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:13:47):**  The second step is to give it, for example, to the food bank so that also people can eat  
**[0:13:53-0:13:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:13:53):**  it.  
**[0:13:54-0:13:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:13:54):**  The third step is conversion to human food.  
**[0:13:57-0:14:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:13:57):**  So for example, a tomato who is not good enough to eat directly, make soup from it.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:14:03):**  That's the third step.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:14:04):**  And the fourth step is using animal feed.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:14:08):**  So and then you have six steps who are more worse.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:14:11):**  And that's for example, biogas.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:14:14):**  That's not as good for the environment as to make food from it with an animal.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:14:19):**  And especially, I think, when you make protein out of it, which is almost a higher step from  
**[0:14:24-0:14:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:14:24):**  the cereal.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:14:25):**  Yeah, that's exactly what you are doing with animal products.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:14:29):**  You are making protein from it for people.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:14:32):**  And in terms of price, I mean, it always comes down.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:14:35):**  It always comes down.  
**[0:14:36-0:14:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:14:36):**  Price is obviously an important thing.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:14:39):**  When I'm in front of the little supermarket in front of the shelf, I know you don't control  
**[0:14:43-0:14:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:14:43):**  the prices, but what is the price range compared to others?  
**[0:14:46-0:14:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:14:46):**  Are you under organic, above, more or less the same?  
**[0:14:50-0:14:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:14:50):**  If you look to normal egg price in the supermarket, then a normal barn egg, that's the basic egg  
**[0:14:56-0:15:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:14:56):**  in the Netherlands, it's about 15 to 18 cents for a consumer.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:15:01):**  A normal free range egg is about 22 to 26 cents an egg.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:15:06):**  And a normal organic egg is 28 to 32 cents an egg.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:15:11):**  And our egg is 25 cents.  
**[0:15:14-0:15:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:15:14):**  So exactly in the middle.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:15:15):**  Yeah, it's almost the same as free range.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:15:18):**  And it seems like people don't mind and actually preferring it because you just said before  
**[0:15:23-0:15:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:15:23):**  that you were constantly saw that, or the little was constantly saw that with your eggs.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:15:28):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:15:29):**  So but I really believe a lot of people are always saying, yeah, but the consumer has  
**[0:15:33-0:15:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:15:33):**  to buy it and they don't want to do it.  
**[0:15:35-0:15:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:15:35):**  I really believe that consumers want to buy it if they know what you are doing, if they  
**[0:15:40-0:15:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:15:40):**  can see what's the difference and what you are doing.  
**[0:15:44-0:15:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:15:44):**  And I really believe that a lot of consumers are concerned about animals and about the  
**[0:15:49-0:15:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:15:49):**  world and they want to do the good thing.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:15:51):**  So I think it's not a problem, but you have to do the right things and you have to tell  
**[0:15:56-0:15:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:15:56):**  the right things.  
**[0:15:57-0:16:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:15:57):**  Yeah, and you see that with the growth of veganism and vegetarianism.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:16:01):**  I think we're in the Netherlands now and the vegetarian restaurant week.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:16:05):**  I mean, there's every week something around this theme.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:16:08):**  And the growth on that is and you're very specific on the website on how many animals,  
**[0:16:13-0:16:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:16:13):**  how much animal protein somebody could consume, obviously coming from the research of Imke.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:16:18):**  Yeah, it's coming from research from Imke de Boer from Wageningen University.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:16:22):**  She's a professor there.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:16:24):**  And what we are working, we are working with her theory.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:16:28):**  So that means if everybody's working like we are doing, there's only feeding West products  
**[0:16:33-0:16:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:16:33):**  to pigs and to chickens and only using marginal land for cows, then if everybody in the world  
**[0:16:39-0:16:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:16:39):**  would work like that, then there is for everybody in the world 20 grams of animal based protein  
**[0:16:46-0:16:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:16:46):**  available per day for all the persons, for all the people in the world.  
**[0:16:51-0:16:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:16:51):**  So the 20 grams of animal protein, that's what's available.  
**[0:16:55-0:17:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:16:55):**  But now in Northwest Europe, we are eating 70 to 75.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:17:00):**  United States 80 to 85, Africa 3 to 10 and Asia 5 to 15.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:17:05):**  So we are also eating a lot too much animal based protein.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:17:10):**  And that's for us also the reason why we are very enthusiastic about the week without meat,  
**[0:17:16-0:17:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:17:16):**  because we really believe that we have to eat less animal based protein.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:17:20):**  Yeah, I couldn't agree more because you basically through this model, you have the max, like  
**[0:17:26-0:17:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:17:26):**  this is what we can produce without eating the planet.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:17:29):**  And there's some rebalancing necessary, obviously, from especially the global north to the global  
**[0:17:34-0:17:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:17:34):**  south.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:17:35):**  But and in general, there's a huge decrease necessary.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:17:40):**  And another question on the process, what happens to the manure of the chickens?  
**[0:17:45-0:17:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:17:45):**  Yeah, the manure, we are drying that in our keppster.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:17:49):**  So we are drying that 80 to 90 percent.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:17:52):**  So that means that we are catching all the water out of it.  
**[0:17:55-0:18:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:17:55):**  So if you are transporting the manure, we are really transporting manure and not water.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:18:01):**  And then we are bringing that back to the land.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:18:04):**  And we are exporting that to the north of France or to Germany.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:18:09):**  But we are making sure that going back on the land so that it's other farmers can use  
**[0:18:14-0:18:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:18:14):**  it to produce plant based food.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:18:18):**  So basically, you could say with with every egg, there are x square meters of land regenerated,  
**[0:18:25-0:18:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:18:25):**  this is an organic fertilizer, not a chemical one, obviously.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:18:28):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:18:31):**  And what is your I mean, you've been in business now since 2017.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:18:36):**  You're opening a second one.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:18:38):**  What is your vision if we would do an interview a year from now, like March 2020?  
**[0:18:44-0:18:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:18:44):**  Where would you like to be with with Kipster?  
**[0:18:46-0:18:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:18:46):**  Yeah, yeah, we are opening a second one for the Netherlands.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:18:51):**  But we have also a contract also for five years with a big catering company in the Netherlands.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:18:58):**  So that that's the third Kipster in the Netherlands.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:19:01):**  And we have also a contract with a little in Belgium that we are going to open a Kipster  
**[0:19:05-0:19:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:19:05):**  in Belgium for for little.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:19:08):**  So that makes for it.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:19:09):**  And we are also talking a lot and have some letter of intent in other countries like the  
**[0:19:17-0:19:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:19:17):**  United States, like France, like Germany.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:19:20):**  So you are talking a lot in other countries.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:19:23):**  And I really believe that we can make from this sustainability project, what we are doing  
**[0:19:29-0:19:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:19:29):**  can really make business from it.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:19:31):**  So over one year, then then, of course, we have to look to the permits and we have to  
**[0:19:35-0:19:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:19:35):**  build.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:19:36):**  So over one year, we have, I think, three Kipsters.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:19:40):**  But if you are talking over five years, then I really believe that we have an international  
**[0:19:46-0:19:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:19:46):**  brand for eggs called Kipster.  
**[0:19:50-0:19:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:19:50):**  And we are working in maybe five or maybe more different countries with this concept.  
**[0:19:57-0:20:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:19:57):**  And are you considering other animals like pigs as they have a similar role, but obviously  
**[0:20:03-0:20:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:20:03):**  don't produce eggs?  
**[0:20:04-0:20:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:20:04):**  Yeah, yeah, that's also what we are doing.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:20:06):**  We are also looking to to other animals, because in this vision, not only chickens fits in  
**[0:20:13-0:20:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:20:13):**  this vision, but also cows or pigs.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:20:16):**  So we are also looking to that.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:20:18):**  But we are doubting a little bit because we have a lot to do.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:20:22):**  And maybe it's better to first to look to what we are doing now to chickens and eggs.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:20:27):**  But we also want to help other farmers or other people who are maybe can do this the  
**[0:20:34-0:20:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:20:34):**  same with pigs or with cows, because we really believe this is the vision and this is how  
**[0:20:39-0:20:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:20:39):**  we have to work in the Netherlands and the rest of the world.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:20:44):**  And what do you think of the I mean, you see a lot of insect companies coming up and a  
**[0:20:50-0:20:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:20:50):**  lot of them are saying certain things on chickens and we're feeding insects to chickens, etc.  
**[0:20:56-0:20:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:20:56):**  Is that something you've been trying with playing with?  
**[0:20:59-0:21:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:20:59):**  Is something you've been thinking about in terms of defeat?  
**[0:21:02-0:21:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:21:02):**  Yeah, we are thinking about and we are doubting about it.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:21:07):**  Because what I see what we are doing is building a complete new business with animals, insects  
**[0:21:13-0:21:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:21:13):**  to help an order a business with animals, chickens make it bigger.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:21:18):**  So I don't know if that's the right way to do.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:21:21):**  Maybe it's better if we are going to do something with insects in the world than to to eat these  
**[0:21:27-0:21:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:21:27):**  insects immediately as person.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:21:29):**  Why with another animal?  
**[0:21:31-0:21:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:21:31):**  That's exactly the same as things on the land.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:21:33):**  Why give it to an animal and not to people directly?  
**[0:21:37-0:21:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:21:37):**  It's exactly the same with insects.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:21:39):**  Why give it to other animals and not directly to people?  
**[0:21:42-0:21:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:21:42):**  Because you're seeing that your chickens don't need any animal protein, in this case, insects  
**[0:21:47-0:21:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:21:47):**  to be well.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:21:48):**  At the moment, we are working without animal protein for our birds and it's going well.  
**[0:21:56-0:22:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:21:56):**  But that could be a reason that we are saying in the future, yeah, OK, maybe we have to  
**[0:22:02-0:22:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:22:02):**  feed some insects because I really believe that it's also good for the welfare from the  
**[0:22:09-0:22:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:22:09):**  birds because, of course, in nature, they are also eating insects.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:22:13):**  But then it would be a little a few part of the feed.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:22:17):**  So maybe one or two percent because it's good for the animal health.  
**[0:22:22-0:22:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:22:22):**  But, yeah, what I say not for the role from animals and feeding the world, because then  
**[0:22:27-0:22:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:22:27):**  I really believe that we can better eat the insects directly.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:22:34):**  And what do you think there is a lot of talk, but especially at larger farms, I haven't  
**[0:22:38-0:22:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:22:38):**  seen it in the Netherlands, honestly, or in Europe, actually not so much, on these chicken  
**[0:22:44-0:22:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:22:44):**  caravans that are moving behind the cows on a lot of regenerative farms, many small ones.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:22:50):**  I'm probably I'm guessing your answer is going to be scale.  
**[0:22:53-0:22:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:22:53):**  What do you think of these chicken caravans that are following the cows on a usually on  
**[0:22:58-0:23:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:22:58):**  a holistic management farm?  
**[0:23:00-0:23:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:23:00):**  Yeah, I think that's that's a fantastic system.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:23:03):**  But that's exactly what you are saying for the moment.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:23:06):**  It's very, very small business.  
**[0:23:09-0:23:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:23:09):**  So it's very expensive eggs and not available for supermarkets because it's the number of  
**[0:23:16-0:23:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:23:16):**  eggs is very low.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:23:18):**  So what we think you have to do is to make the eggs as good as possible with animal environment  
**[0:23:24-0:23:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:23:24):**  and people friendly as possible, but also available for the average consumer.  
**[0:23:31-0:23:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:23:31):**  So it must not be a very high price for the eggs because then it's only for the happy  
**[0:23:37-0:23:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:23:37):**  few.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:23:38):**  And we want to make products for the average consumer.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:23:43):**  But these initiatives with such things are really happy with it because I think for now,  
**[0:23:49-0:23:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:23:49):**  I think it's not the right way to do for this moment.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:23:52):**  But maybe if they engineer and they do some innovative things, maybe over 10 years, it's  
**[0:23:57-0:23:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:23:57):**  completely different.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:23:58):**  Yeah, I think there's a big question there, not only on scale, but also on what do the  
**[0:24:02-0:24:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:24:02):**  chickens eat?  
**[0:24:03-0:24:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:24:03):**  Because they obviously have seen the numbers and they eat a lot of things on the land where  
**[0:24:08-0:24:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:24:08):**  they are, where they are moved on.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:24:11):**  But they don't only eat that.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:24:12):**  They usually eat some other types of grain, et cetera.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:24:15):**  And then we enter in exactly the same discussion.  
**[0:24:18-0:24:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:24:18):**  What do they eat beyond just the insects and some of the grasses they eat?  
**[0:24:22-0:24:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:24:22):**  And they usually eat up to 50 percent of other things, which shouldn't be something that  
**[0:24:26-0:24:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:24:26):**  we could eat as well.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:24:27):**  Yeah.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:24:28):**  Or maybe you can give them then also West products.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:24:30):**  Yeah, for example, I mean, of course, if you can buy a good mix that that you're using  
**[0:24:36-0:24:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:24:36):**  and you can then it becomes a very interesting because then the role then you don't have  
**[0:24:39-0:24:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:24:39):**  to drive the manure out anymore because it's actually already done.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:24:43):**  But yet the prices and scale is it's I don't see it changing very quickly to something  
**[0:24:50-0:24:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:24:50):**  that the supermarket could buy because just to give an idea how many eggs a day do you  
**[0:24:55-0:24:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:24:55):**  do or do your laying hands make basically or lay?  
**[0:24:59-0:25:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:24:59):**  An average 22,500, so seven and a half million a year.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:25:07):**  Which is not a small, which is not a small feat.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:25:09):**  Yeah, no, it's not.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:25:11):**  It's not.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:25:12):**  It's not a small number.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:25:13):**  No, exactly.  
**[0:25:14-0:25:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:25:14):**  I mean, you explained how you fit into the larger system and that you're you're relatively  
**[0:25:18-0:25:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:25:18):**  small compared to some other operations.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:25:20):**  But still, for most most people thinking about chickens and poultry, they would probably  
**[0:25:25-0:25:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:25:25):**  not think about these numbers.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:25:28):**  No, exactly.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:25:29):**  Some final questions on the financing or the business side of things.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:25:35):**  How has that been so far?  
**[0:25:37-0:25:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:25:37):**  How has it been financed?  
**[0:25:38-0:25:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:25:38):**  If you're willing to share, obviously, has it been difficult to get to investors that  
**[0:25:42-0:25:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:25:42):**  understand these kind of things?  
**[0:25:45-0:25:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:25:45):**  How has it been that journey to from idea?  
**[0:25:47-0:25:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:25:47):**  I mean, obviously, find a little, but I don't think they invested.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:25:49):**  I think they just guaranteed some offtake.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:25:52):**  How did you manage to build it?  
**[0:25:56-0:25:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:25:56):**  Exactly the little guarantee.  
**[0:25:57-0:26:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:25:57):**  Yeah, but with that guarantee, you can go to investors because that's comfortable for  
**[0:26:02-0:26:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:26:02):**  us and for them.  
**[0:26:04-0:26:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:26:04):**  But now for the first for the first capstone, we had a private investor who really believed  
**[0:26:10-0:26:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:26:10):**  in what we were what we were saying and what we were doing.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:26:14):**  And actually, that was not very difficult, to be honest, because when we had the contract  
**[0:26:18-0:26:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:26:18):**  from the little in two months, we had we had our finance.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:26:22):**  So that was that was very fast, I think.  
**[0:26:26-0:26:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:26:26):**  And now for the rest, now we have proof that it's possible.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:26:29):**  We showed it's possible.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:26:30):**  Our financials are we are very happy with it.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:26:34):**  And now also, it's possible to finance it by bank.  
**[0:26:37-0:26:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:26:37):**  So that's what we are now doing for the for the next capstones.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:26:41):**  We are financing it actually in the normal way.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:26:45):**  Wow, which I think in less than two years, which is a huge, huge achievement.  
**[0:26:51-0:26:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:26:51):**  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  
**[0:26:54-0:27:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:26:54):**  For this moment, we are very satisfied with our results and all our attention for Capstone.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:27:01):**  Because if you if you told me this two years ago, then I would have said to you, you are  
**[0:27:07-0:27:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:27:07):**  crazy because we don't believe you.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:27:09):**  And to finalize or to draw this this podcast to a conclusion, because I want to be conscious  
**[0:27:14-0:27:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:27:14):**  of your time, two final questions.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:27:16):**  I always say final question and I have two others.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:27:19):**  If imagine there's a room full of smart impact investors listening to you to this podcast  
**[0:27:24-0:27:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:27:24):**  and they they really want to put their money to work in the future, the system, the food  
**[0:27:29-0:27:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:27:29):**  system of the future.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:27:31):**  And of course, we're not giving investment advice.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:27:32):**  But what would be some of your pointers?  
**[0:27:35-0:27:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:27:35):**  Where should they learn more?  
**[0:27:37-0:27:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:27:37):**  Where should they look at in terms of sectors, in terms of parts of the food and agriculture  
**[0:27:42-0:27:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:27:42):**  sector where where their investment euros and dollars and yen, etc., can can have the  
**[0:27:47-0:27:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:27:47):**  most impact?  
**[0:27:48-0:27:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:27:48):**  What would you tell them?  
**[0:27:50-0:27:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:27:50):**  Yeah, I think then it's really important not to look to only to the economic efficiency,  
**[0:27:57-0:28:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:27:57):**  but also to the ecological efficiency.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:28:01):**  So why are we doing things?  
**[0:28:03-0:28:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:28:03):**  What's the role of animals?  
**[0:28:04-0:28:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:28:04):**  What's the role of the land?  
**[0:28:06-0:28:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:28:06):**  Why on this land producing cereals and why on that land grass and cow or goats?  
**[0:28:14-0:28:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:28:14):**  So I think we have to look from what's the best to do for the world and have a look to  
**[0:28:20-0:28:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:28:20):**  that.  
**[0:28:21-0:28:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:28:21):**  And if we have that, then then then we can produce our food.  
**[0:28:24-0:28:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:28:24):**  So and it's completely different if I compare with what we have done the last 50 years.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:28:29):**  So I think we have to look to a new structure.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:28:33):**  And then for the most important thing is to ask ourselves the question, why are we doing  
**[0:28:39-0:28:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:28:39):**  these things?  
**[0:28:40-0:28:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:28:40):**  And why are we doing this with this animal?  
**[0:28:42-0:28:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:28:42):**  And why are we doing this on this place?  
**[0:28:45-0:28:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:28:45):**  These are very, very, very fundamental questions.  
**[0:28:47-0:28:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:28:47):**  I remember it gets Ricardo Semmler that kept saying you have to ask why three times, which  
**[0:28:52-0:28:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:28:52):**  usually gets you to the core of an issue of a problem, because after the second one, you  
**[0:28:57-0:29:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:28:57):**  start to get to a really interesting, interesting place.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:29:01):**  And to finalize this one, what what if you could change one thing overnight?  
**[0:29:06-0:29:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:29:06):**  So you have a magic wand and you could change one thing in the food and agriculture system,  
**[0:29:10-0:29:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:29:10):**  or even in the investment system if you want to.  
**[0:29:13-0:29:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:29:13):**  What would you do as co-founder of Kipster?  
**[0:29:15-0:29:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:29:15):**  What would you change?  
**[0:29:16-0:29:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:29:16):**  Then I then I would immediately stop with using all these animals just for human beings.  
**[0:29:24-0:29:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:29:24):**  I think that is a little bit crazy what we are doing with all these animals.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:29:28):**  So I dream I'm dreaming of a world in which we don't use animals anymore for our food.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:29:35):**  And I know that for now it's not not possible.  
**[0:29:39-0:29:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:29:39):**  That's also the reason why we are going on with Kipster, because we think if we are using  
**[0:29:44-0:29:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:29:44):**  animals, do it as animal friendly and people friendly and environment friendly as possible.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:29:48):**  But I hope that over 20 or 30 years, we don't don't use animals anymore for our food.  
**[0:29:56-0:30:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:29:56):**  Thank you so much, and I'll definitely be checking in to see where you're at in a year  
**[0:30:01-0:30:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:30:01):**  or in two or in five years.  
**[0:30:03-0:30:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:30:03):**  Yeah, that would be nice.

**[0:32:26-0:32:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:32:26):**  And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office

**[0:32:41-0:32:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:32:41):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:32:43):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.

**[0:32:52-0:32:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:32:52):**  different means.

**[0:32:58-0:33:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:32:58):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:33:01):**  Thank you.  
**[0:33:02-0:33:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:33:02):**  So what is this course?  
**[0:33:03-0:33:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:33:03):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  
**[0:33:09-0:33:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:33:09):**  so you don't have to write along.  
**[0:33:11-0:33:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:33:11):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:33:16-0:33:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:33:16):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:33:22-0:33:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:33:22):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find, or what kind of investors you could  
**[0:33:26-0:33:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:33:26):**  find if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/#t=0:33:28):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what

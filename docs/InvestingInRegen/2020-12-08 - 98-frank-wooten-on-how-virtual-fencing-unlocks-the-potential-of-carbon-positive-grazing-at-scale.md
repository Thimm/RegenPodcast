**[0:00:16-0:00:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:00:16):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture, investing as if  
**[0:00:20-0:00:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:00:20):**  the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:00:21):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:26-0:00:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:00:26):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:00:31-0:00:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:00:31):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:00:36):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:38-0:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:00:38):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:00:42-0:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:00:42):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:00:44):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:00:49-0:00:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:00:49):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:00:53-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:00:53):**  In March last year, we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support

**[0:01:19-0:01:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:01:19):**  Welcome to another episode.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:01:20):**  Today with Frank Wooten, founder of Fence, livestock production reinvented, virtual fencing  
**[0:01:25-0:01:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:01:25):**  and autonomous animal control.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:01:28):**  And then they have an amazing subline, which is double your profit with Fence.  
**[0:01:32-0:01:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:01:32):**  Welcome Frank.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:01:33):**  How's it going this morning?  
**[0:01:34-0:01:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:01:34):**  Very good.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:01:35):**  We have a lot to unpack there.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:01:36):**  I'm very interested in the double your profit, obviously, but also the autonomous animal  
**[0:01:39-0:01:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:01:39):**  control.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:01:40):**  But let's start with your story first.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:01:43):**  You didn't start in soil.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:01:45):**  How did you end up going after farmers' profits, soil building and even carbon in the last  
**[0:01:50-0:01:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:01:50):**  few years?  
**[0:01:51-0:01:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:01:51):**  Yeah, like most people's entrepreneurial path, it's a bit circuitous.  
**[0:01:57-0:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:01:57):**  So I actually my first career, first life was in finance.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:02:03):**  And so I was one of those people that everybody loves to hate, worked on Wall Street for six  
**[0:02:06-0:02:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:02:06):**  years and then actually was on the investment side for another six years.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:02:11):**  Always focused on small companies.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:02:13):**  And when I kind of started looking around for my next foray or next entree and what  
**[0:02:21-0:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:02:21):**  it wanted to do, I ended up looking for something that actually, like most people do, had felt  
**[0:02:26-0:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:02:26):**  like it had more purpose and felt like it was one of these things that had more meaning.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:02:31):**  I ended up landing at a startup.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:02:33):**  Actually I was in Brazil at the time.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:02:35):**  I was focused on health insurance tech and I was approached via my now co-founder with  
**[0:02:41-0:02:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:02:41):**  this idea for an angel investment in this crazy idea of putting a collar on cattle and  
**[0:02:47-0:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:02:47):**  like removing the need for fences.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:02:50):**  And at the time I just kind of said, well, I've got no insight into ag, I've got no background  
**[0:02:54-0:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:02:54):**  into any of these things, but it sounds intriguing at a minimum.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:02:58):**  Let me just kind of dig in, so to speak.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:03:01):**  And the more time that I spent on it, the more interest that I got.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:03:06):**  Being in Brazil at the time and working down there, you have access to kind of one of the  
**[0:03:10-0:03:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:03:10):**  largest beef markets in the world, so you can get out on farms fairly easily and see  
**[0:03:15-0:03:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:03:15):**  the magnitude of this, of the problem.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:03:18):**  My direct response to how to get into soil is actually, it started with the size of the  
**[0:03:24-0:03:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:03:24):**  opportunity.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:03:25):**  It started with kind of like there's a billion head of cattle out there on the planet and  
**[0:03:29-0:03:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:03:29):**  there's three plus billion total livestock and it's like this massive opportunity space.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:03:37):**  And fencing is what was the control mechanism for all of those animals.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:03:41):**  And so the magnitude of the opportunity is what really sucked me in.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:03:45):**  And that fencing was this sense of control and sense of enhanced profitability, which  
**[0:03:52-0:03:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:03:52):**  I certainly understood from my background, right?  
**[0:03:55-0:03:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:03:55):**  It was this financial lens that I was looking at it through.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:03:59):**  And then what happened over time is that I really started to understand that soil was  
**[0:04:05-0:04:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:04:05):**  the mechanism, which it was the translation mechanism for increased productivity on a  
**[0:04:11-0:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:04:11):**  farm and that fencing was just one of the tools in the toolkit, animals being another  
**[0:04:18-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:04:18):**  one that are really helping this kind of translation mechanism.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:04:23):**  And so it's been an indirect path, but I'm squarely there now.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:04:29):**  And when was Brazil for you?  
**[0:04:30-0:04:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:04:30):**  When are we talking?  
**[0:04:31-0:04:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:04:31):**  When was this?  
**[0:04:32-0:04:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:04:32):**  So this was 2015, 2016.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:04:36):**  So we started the business.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:04:37):**  I took a while, it took me about six months.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:04:39):**  And at that point in time, I'd gone from like skeptical angel investor to like, okay, I  
**[0:04:45-0:04:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:04:45):**  want to take this thing and run with it.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:04:47):**  Like it's just this really amazing opportunity.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:04:50):**  And that was mid to late October, mid to late October 2016 that we formed the company.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:04:57):**  So there was a company already that you ended up investing in or it was just an idea?  
**[0:05:02-0:05:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:05:02):**  There was no company.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:05:03):**  So I kind of invested and launched the company at the same time.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:05:07):**  And what is fence?  
**[0:05:08-0:05:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:05:08):**  Because you talked about a collar and then fencing.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:05:11):**  And I think some people are wondering this autonomous animal control thing that Kun said  
**[0:05:14-0:05:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:05:14):**  at the beginning, what is fence and walk us through and make it as visual as possible  
**[0:05:19-0:05:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:05:19):**  because we're in audio, obviously.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:05:21):**  Yeah.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:05:23):**  Most people have some concept of an invisible fence for dogs.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:05:27):**  A lot of people kind of have this visual where the dog has a collar and there's generally  
**[0:05:32-0:05:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:05:32):**  a wire in the ground.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:05:34):**  And if that dog walks up to near where that wire is, they hear a sound.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:05:38):**  And if they go over that wire, they'll get an electric stimulus.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:05:42):**  We've done that except there is no wire in the ground.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:05:46):**  It's all based on GPS.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:05:49):**  And it's obviously you need to magnify, increase the size of that for cattle.  
**[0:05:53-0:06:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:05:53):**  So we've built this kind of end-to-end system where you can hop on your computer browser,  
**[0:06:01-0:06:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:06:01):**  draw up a fence line.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:06:02):**  That fence line gets sent down to a collar in the middle of your pasture.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:06:09):**  And you can program it to turn on, turn off, or move animals from one place to another  
**[0:06:14-0:06:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:06:14):**  via the utilization of sound.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:06:16):**  So cattle are much smarter than most people give them credit for.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:06:19):**  They learn really quickly to respond to sound.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:06:23):**  And so the only visuals that I have for you are really the collar that you can kind of  
**[0:06:28-0:06:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:06:28):**  envisage.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:06:29):**  Just to imagine for people, so you see this herd of cows that have a collar around their  
**[0:06:33-0:06:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:06:33):**  neck and the farmer is basically programmed a virtual fence.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:06:36):**  There's no real fence.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:06:37):**  So it's just an enormous open space, potentially with trees, potentially not, depending on  
**[0:06:41-0:06:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:06:41):**  the field.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:06:42):**  And the farmer decides today, I'm moving the cows to the next virtual field to the right,  
**[0:06:47-0:06:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:06:47):**  or I'm wanting to move them to the right, draws that square.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:06:50):**  And the sound in the collar is basically it starts buzzing or such making a sound that  
**[0:06:55-0:06:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:06:55):**  at some point the cow moves to the right direction and stops when the cow is at the new place  
**[0:06:59-0:07:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:06:59):**  we like them to be.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:07:01):**  But without any fencing, without any dogs, without any helicopters, without any person  
**[0:07:06-0:07:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:07:06):**  or something pushing them there, they move that in itself.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:07:09):**  It's somewhat romantic when you get to see it actually out in the field, right?  
**[0:07:12-0:07:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:07:12):**  Because you're like, I want the animals to be here, but I don't want to have the fence  
**[0:07:15-0:07:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:07:15):**  line there.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:07:16):**  I want to have all of this occurring and you can see animals just move from one space to  
**[0:07:21-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:07:21):**  another without the need for any physical intervention as it relates to you.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:07:26):**  Because now often they will touch the fence line, which is electric.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:07:29):**  If you are doing adaptive grazing, rotational grazing, et cetera.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:07:33):**  And of course they get some electric stimulus, as you call that.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:07:36):**  And they know, okay, we're not going past here.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:07:38):**  We're moving to the right or to the left or wherever you want to go.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:07:41):**  So they're moving by themselves.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:07:43):**  And I wanted to ask the third question immediately, how annoying is it for the animal?  
**[0:07:47-0:07:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:07:47):**  Yeah.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:07:48):**  It's like all cattle learn the way that they learn electric fence is actually they put  
**[0:07:54-0:07:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:07:54):**  their nose on it.  
**[0:07:55-0:07:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:07:55):**  Which seems pretty annoying.  
**[0:07:57-0:07:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:07:57):**  Yeah.  
**[0:07:58-0:07:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:07:58):**  It's very annoying.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:07:59):**  Annoying would be a mild word, right?  
**[0:08:03-0:08:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:08:03):**  It's training them via aversive Pavlovian training.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:08:07):**  So you're basically saying you now have a visual stimulus that you're correlating to  
**[0:08:11-0:08:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:08:11):**  that and stay away from this.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:08:14):**  What our order of magnitudes of an electric fence will generally be somewhere in the order  
**[0:08:20-0:08:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:08:20):**  of magnitude of 3000 to 8000 volts, depending on if you're running cows versus bulls versus  
**[0:08:26-0:08:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:08:26):**  steers, et cetera.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:08:28):**  Yeah.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:08:29):**  What I have bison year up at the top in there.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:08:32):**  And then we're about 800 volts is what the stimulus is.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:08:35):**  And we've done a bunch of different cortisol tests on animals and looked at kind of change  
**[0:08:41-0:08:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:08:41):**  in behavioral patterns.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:08:42):**  And there are a number of studies that are out there that have been done on this.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:08:46):**  And there's actually no differentiation in terms of kind of stress on animals.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:08:52):**  How annoying is it?  
**[0:08:53-0:08:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:08:53):**  I mean, it's annoying, right?  
**[0:08:54-0:08:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:08:54):**  Like you got a hundred volt stimulus, you'd avoid that sound.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:08:57):**  But the reality is that's how animals are trained right now.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:09:01):**  It's not.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:09:02):**  So it's a shock or it's a sound or it's both.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:09:04):**  A sound and stimulus is what trains the animal.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:09:08):**  And then 95 percent of the time after that, it's just sound, just sound.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:09:12):**  OK, it's like the proverbial a lot of kids put their hand on the stove before they learn  
**[0:09:17-0:09:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:09:17):**  that that's hot and then they shouldn't anymore.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:09:20):**  But you always have a couple of kids who put their hand on the stove a couple of times.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:09:24):**  And then after it's the heat that makes you feel it.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:09:27):**  Exactly.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:09:28):**  That's what happens for us.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:09:29):**  It ends up being largely sound that controls animals.  
**[0:09:32-0:09:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:09:32):**  So it saves an enormous amount of fencing.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:09:34):**  I was going to ask you, you said three billion heads of cattle in the world.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:09:38):**  Like, have you ever done like do we know how much fencing there is?  
**[0:09:41-0:09:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:09:41):**  One billion, but three plus billion.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:09:43):**  If you have 900 million sheep, 400 million goats.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:09:46):**  Do we know how much fence line there is in the world?  
**[0:09:48-0:09:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:09:48):**  I've spent a lot of time going down to Google rat hole.  
**[0:09:51-0:09:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:09:51):**  OK, so if anybody has that data, would be nice.  
**[0:09:53-0:09:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:09:53):**  Send it over.  
**[0:09:54-0:09:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:09:54):**  But so do we don't.  
**[0:09:55-0:09:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:09:55):**  But it's a lot.  
**[0:09:56-0:09:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:09:56):**  For sure.  
**[0:09:57-0:09:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:09:57):**  It's a lot.  
**[0:09:58-0:09:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:09:58):**  It's a significant amount of fence line.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:09:59):**  And it's mostly this really nasty barbwire.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:10:01):**  Like, it's not just to keep livestock in, but also there's an enormous amount of wildlife  
**[0:10:06-0:10:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:10:06):**  that gets trapped in all of that.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:10:08):**  Yeah.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:10:09):**  So I think it's a it's been since people really started this and you've got fence lines, fence  
**[0:10:15-0:10:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:10:15):**  line.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:10:16):**  I kind of like to joke around and say it's a 10000 plus year old technology because you  
**[0:10:21-0:10:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:10:21):**  can go to throughout Europe.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:10:23):**  We obviously we don't have as much of this like super steeped history and fencing in  
**[0:10:28-0:10:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:10:28):**  the US.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:10:29):**  But the sophistication of wildlife and you go to you go in in Ireland, you'll see these  
**[0:10:33-0:10:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:10:33):**  old rock fences that have been up for thousands of years.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:10:39):**  And the newest technology that happened and you had the barbed wire was invented in the  
**[0:10:45-0:10:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:10:45):**  eighteen hundreds, which helped tame the American West.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:10:48):**  And then the electric fence was invented in kind of the late 1930s, 1940s.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:10:53):**  But it's taken a while to get adopted as well.  
**[0:10:55-0:10:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:10:55):**  So you save a lot of fencing, but that's not why we're so excited about this.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:10:59):**  We're excited because of other reasons.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:11:01):**  Why is it so amazing for the farmer apart from fencing, which is an enormous cost and  
**[0:11:06-0:11:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:11:06):**  enormous headaches, etc.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:11:08):**  But if you start to go to virtual fencing, you suddenly unlock an amount of opportunities  
**[0:11:13-0:11:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:11:13):**  that I at least never thought of until I started to think this through a bit.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:11:16):**  So talk us through what makes this possible for a farmer or rancher.  
**[0:11:20-0:11:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:11:20):**  Yeah, I think like one of the things that like that people who aren't on the farm don't  
**[0:11:25-0:11:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:11:25):**  necessarily think about is like with fencing, creating a static solution to actually a dynamic  
**[0:11:32-0:11:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:11:32):**  problem.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:11:33):**  And as we know everywhere else in our lives, that doesn't work particularly well.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:11:38):**  It's a you know, and what I mean by that is like even over the course of a year, if everything  
**[0:11:43-0:11:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:11:43):**  is exactly the same in terms of precipitation and climate patterns over the course of the  
**[0:11:48-0:11:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:11:48):**  year during that year, you need different fencing based on what the growth is in your  
**[0:11:53-0:12:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:11:53):**  pastures because you've got springtime, you've got winter and yet since people make a $10,000  
**[0:12:02-0:12:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:12:02):**  a mile physical fence investment in it, they just kind of say, okay, well, we're going  
**[0:12:07-0:12:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:12:07):**  to use this.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:12:08):**  It's the solution that we have.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:12:09):**  This is what we're going to use.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:12:11):**  And so the ability to adapt, which is like, you know, amp grazing, you know, but like  
**[0:12:16-0:12:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:12:16):**  the ability to adapt to what the climate is telling you to what the season is telling  
**[0:12:20-0:12:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:12:20):**  you and to what your animals are.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:12:22):**  Just amp grazing is adaptive multi-product grazing just for the, for the senior.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:12:29):**  But the ability to adapt, observe is very different if you have no fencing.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:12:35):**  Exactly.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:12:36):**  And then what that allows you to do, like if you think about why farmers utilize fencing  
**[0:12:44-0:12:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:12:44):**  and we're going to get, you know, I'll start diving into this a little bit here, but like  
**[0:12:48-0:12:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:12:48):**  livestock farmers are grass farmers.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:12:50):**  It's a grass factory and their goal is how to optimally translate solar energy into grass  
**[0:12:59-0:13:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:12:59):**  growth is kind of the equation that they need for maximum productivity.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:13:04):**  And the cattle are the worker bees that are a taking that grass and translating it into  
**[0:13:12-0:13:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:13:12):**  a consumable product, whether that's meat or milk, but they're also optimizing what  
**[0:13:17-0:13:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:13:17):**  its growth patterns look like.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:13:18):**  So they're, they're grooming it.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:13:20):**  And if you think about grass, so like you get into why fencing is needed, you, it's  
**[0:13:26-0:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:13:26):**  about your grass growth patterns and how grass optimally translates into a solar panel.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:13:32):**  You go dig a little bit further and you say, okay, well yeah, it kind of makes sense if,  
**[0:13:36-0:13:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:13:36):**  if grass is at stubble, it has no solar panel.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:13:40):**  If grass actually gets to this past its peak growth, you can actually see it in a field  
**[0:13:46-0:13:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:13:46):**  where it starts to bend over and it starts to have dead leaves on the end and its growth  
**[0:13:51-0:13:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:13:51):**  pattern is reduced.  
**[0:13:52-0:13:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:13:52):**  And so all of that means there is an optimal growth period at which you should have animals  
**[0:13:58-0:14:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:13:58):**  be grooming that grass.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:14:01):**  And that's what fencing is for.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:14:02):**  That's the purpose of fencing on a livestock farm.  
**[0:14:05-0:14:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:14:05):**  And if you are dealing with a static solution to that, which is permanent existing fences,  
**[0:14:12-0:14:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:14:12):**  you are unable to optimally manage your property for productivity.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:14:17):**  So from our customer's perspective, it's really a productivity and yield question as it relates  
**[0:14:24-0:14:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:14:24):**  to fencing.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:14:25):**  And what we enable customers to do is really dynamically, really quickly fix that and have  
**[0:14:31-0:14:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:14:31):**  the ability to change that without the need for infrastructure or labor.  
**[0:14:36-0:14:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:14:36):**  So it's a tool that's in their toolbox that previously was just completely unfathomable.  
**[0:14:41-0:14:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:14:41):**  Talk us through an example, one of your customers.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:14:45):**  What does that mean for the farmer, the bottom line, the company, the family?  
**[0:14:50-0:14:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:14:50):**  What does this enable somebody to do in an interesting, I mean, you have many, obviously,  
**[0:14:54-0:14:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:14:54):**  but in an interesting example, what is one that sticks out when somebody asks you, OK,  
**[0:14:59-0:15:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:14:59):**  tell me about a real life example.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:15:00):**  A great example is one of our customers who we love.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:15:06):**  All of our customers are kind of really interesting and cool individuals and Leo, this guy, Leo  
**[0:15:12-0:15:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:15:12):**  Barthelmus up in Montana on Barthelmus Farm.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:15:16):**  He's up in northern Montana and he's owned his property for now almost 60 years.  
**[0:15:23-0:15:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:15:23):**  And over the course of that, so he bought the farm, it was 35,000 acres basically, and  
**[0:15:30-0:15:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:15:30):**  it was four pastures.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:15:32):**  At that time, he's got a couple hundred animals on that piece of property.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:15:36):**  He's kind of looking at it and over the course of 50 years, he went from four pastures to  
**[0:15:42-0:15:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:15:42):**  30.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:15:43):**  And the reason it took so long to do that is because of how much money and how much  
**[0:15:48-0:15:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:15:48):**  labor is required to set up that fencing, as well as you just not having the ability  
**[0:15:54-0:15:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:15:54):**  to manage those animals between one area and another.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:15:58):**  So you have to move the animals from paddock to paddock.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:16:01):**  You have to be able to get in there and monitor.  
**[0:16:03-0:16:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:16:03):**  There's so many other things that he had to do.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:16:04):**  He just didn't have resources to increase the intensity of management on that property.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:16:10):**  And so in an actual basis over those years, he put up the equivalent of, call it 10 miles  
**[0:16:17-0:16:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:16:17):**  of fencing, a little bit more than that.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:16:19):**  We put our product out on his property last November.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:16:24):**  So one year ago.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:16:25):**  Yeah.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:16:26):**  Yeah.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:16:27):**  So one year ago, actually, exactly right now.  
**[0:16:29-0:16:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:16:29):**  We actually just went up there and shot some video with him just on his property because  
**[0:16:32-0:16:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:16:32):**  it's snowing.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:16:33):**  We've got cattle out grazing in the snow.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:16:36):**  And the first six months of putting our product in his pastures across his herd, we put up  
**[0:16:43-0:16:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:16:43):**  the equivalent of 40 miles of fencing.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:16:46):**  So we did 4x what he was able to do in 50 years in six months for the cost of a mile  
**[0:16:53-0:16:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:16:53):**  and a half of fencing.  
**[0:16:55-0:17:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:16:55):**  And so the ability for him to change how he was able to put pressure on his landscape,  
**[0:17:03-0:17:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:17:03):**  how that translates to his bottom line, which is critical for us to even have a business,  
**[0:17:08-0:17:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:17:08):**  is that at the end of the year, when he looks at his property and he's looking at what his  
**[0:17:13-0:17:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:17:13):**  feed reserves are, OK, it's wintertime in Montana.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:17:18):**  And we've got to either go buy feed or we have to have feed on the ground that exists  
**[0:17:23-0:17:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:17:23):**  or we need to have baled hay, he would historically go out and have to have to spend hundreds  
**[0:17:28-0:17:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:17:28):**  of thousands of dollars over the coming months to support his animals' growth and weight.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:17:34):**  And he's actually not 100% there, but he's almost to the point where that's all produced  
**[0:17:40-0:17:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:17:40):**  on his farm.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:17:41):**  And we think that, like all regenerative ag products, there's a little bit of time that  
**[0:17:46-0:17:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:17:46):**  it takes nature to adapt to changes in productivity.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:17:50):**  So this isn't something that's going to happen 100% overnight.  
**[0:17:54-0:17:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:17:54):**  But you know that over the course of the next year, he's going to be at a self-sustaining  
**[0:17:59-0:18:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:17:59):**  entity, which for him on the bottom line means that we've paid for ourselves seven to 10  
**[0:18:06-0:18:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:18:06):**  times over in a very short period.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:18:08):**  And then we'll continue to pay for ourselves over each year and subsequently.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:18:12):**  And this brings up a nice question.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:18:14):**  How does the business model work?  
**[0:18:16-0:18:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:18:16):**  Do I rent the collars, does every animal need one?  
**[0:18:20-0:18:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:18:20):**  And does I just rent one per year or something per animal?  
**[0:18:23-0:18:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:18:23):**  Or how does it practically work?  
**[0:18:24-0:18:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:18:24):**  Yeah, so we lease the collars to customers.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:18:27):**  We view, I call it the iPhone issue that you face with technology on farms is that like,  
**[0:18:35-0:18:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:18:35):**  everybody knows there's going to be a new version of your product at some point in the  
**[0:18:37-0:18:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:18:37):**  future.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:18:38):**  And since we're replacing a 10,000 year old technology, people are kind of like, Oh, well,  
**[0:18:45-0:18:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:18:45):**  I can wait until generation two, or maybe even generation three.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:18:50):**  And so to short circuit that kind of as a business challenge, what we did.  
**[0:18:55-0:18:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:18:55):**  And rightfully so, because they've probably seen like a million other technologies come  
**[0:18:58-0:19:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:18:58):**  and disappear very, very quickly.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:19:01):**  They all have a shed of just technology that is now completely obsolete.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:19:06):**  And they're going, Oh, yeah, you're going to sit next to XYZ's product that he sold  
**[0:19:11-0:19:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:19:11):**  my grandfather, you know, whatever it happens to be.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:19:14):**  And so we tried to short circuit that in this kind of leasing rental model.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:19:19):**  So it's $35 per animal per year, that scales up and down a little bit based on the size  
**[0:19:24-0:19:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:19:24):**  of the farm.  
**[0:19:25-0:19:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:19:25):**  And then we will kind of upsell those customers on different features and functionality as  
**[0:19:31-0:19:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:19:31):**  well if they're kind of relevant to their farm.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:19:35):**  We do put it on all animals, we view the kind of control of the entire herd is a critical  
**[0:19:41-0:19:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:19:41):**  part of how our system works, and it's necessary for customers to put it across the whole herd.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:19:46):**  You're saying upsell, I've seen obviously, there are a lot of interesting things you  
**[0:19:50-0:19:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:19:50):**  can do with the data or how you can help the farms to optimize not just replacing my real  
**[0:19:56-0:19:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:19:56):**  fence with a virtual one, and I can sort of adapt it a bit.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:19:59):**  Now there's a whole world of opportunities that you unlock as soon as you can just sit  
**[0:20:04-0:20:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:20:04):**  at your kitchen table and change your fencing in the morning.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:20:06):**  What are some of the exciting examples or things that you think may happen in the future  
**[0:20:11-0:20:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:20:11):**  with, let's say, exciting examples you can do now that are completely impossible with  
**[0:20:16-0:20:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:20:16):**  real life fencing?  
**[0:20:18-0:20:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:20:18):**  And what are things that probably that I think is very interesting, because that's why I  
**[0:20:22-0:20:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:20:22):**  bring things like this on.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:20:23):**  What's the role of tech in regenerative agriculture?  
**[0:20:25-0:20:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:20:25):**  How can it help farmers to really fundamentally farm differently?  
**[0:20:30-0:20:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:20:30):**  And virtual fencing, I think fits perfectly in that bucket.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:20:33):**  But I'm always curious to hear what are the crazy things possible with technology like  
**[0:20:37-0:20:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:20:37):**  this that we didn't even think about?  
**[0:20:39-0:20:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:20:39):**  Yeah, I think so the reason we think virtual fencing is really the foundation of the product  
**[0:20:46-0:20:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:20:46):**  is that it generates this return that I've already described to you.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:20:48):**  And so that enables us to put a device on each animal.  
**[0:20:54-0:20:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:20:54):**  And there are a lot of things you can do with sensors and that have been shown to be that  
**[0:20:58-0:20:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:20:58):**  can be done with sensors.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:20:59):**  And I'll talk about a second here.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:21:01):**  But most of those don't justify the application doesn't justify putting a device on each animal.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:21:08):**  It's kind of like, oh, that's really cool.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:21:09):**  But it generates x percent of return doesn't pay for doesn't pay for the device in the  
**[0:21:14-0:21:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:21:14):**  service each year.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:21:15):**  And so that's the reason that actually, I got super excited about virtual fencing is  
**[0:21:19-0:21:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:21:19):**  it's putting an iWatch on your hand, all of a sudden, you've got your watch on your hand.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:21:23):**  And it's really interesting.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:21:25):**  And it's got some applications and serves a purpose as it relates to your phone.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:21:30):**  And then all of a sudden, Apple comes out and they go, Hey, by the way, we can detect  
**[0:21:33-0:21:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:21:33):**  if you have heart arrhythmia.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:21:35):**  Because we've been looking at your data over the last year and we have insight into it.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:21:39):**  We're going to be able to do the same exact thing as it relates to fertility detection.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:21:45):**  All of a sudden, we can tell farmers, hey, this animal is not going through its fertility  
**[0:21:50-0:21:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:21:50):**  cycle, or this animal stopped at this point in time.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:21:52):**  So we actually know that it was impregnated in field at this point in time via this bull,  
**[0:21:57-0:22:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:21:57):**  that level of insight right now doesn't exist.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:22:01):**  And it's done through, there's a physical preg check that happens on animals.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:22:07):**  There is DNA testing that can be done to look to see who the sire is of animals.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:22:14):**  And you also just generally won't know until the end of your year if your cattle are no  
**[0:22:19-0:22:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:22:19):**  longer going through the fertility cycle on a beef farm, they're, for lack of a better  
**[0:22:25-0:22:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:22:25):**  term, non-producing assets.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:22:27):**  And so it's an inefficient use for the land and it's an inefficient use of that farmer's  
**[0:22:33-0:22:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:22:33):**  resources to actually keep that animal eating grass.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:22:36):**  It's just sitting there eating grass and not producing a calf, which is the end product  
**[0:22:41-0:22:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:22:41):**  of a pasture-based livestock farm.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:22:44):**  And so when we look at the opportunities that we have there, we view there being this really  
**[0:22:49-0:22:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:22:49):**  interesting on-farm application where we're going, hey, we can now look at health metrics  
**[0:22:57-0:22:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:22:57):**  for animals.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:22:58):**  We can look at targeted view, whether or not this animal has changed its behavioral pattern  
**[0:23:06-0:23:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:23:06):**  from this period of time to another, whether or not it's calving, all of these insights,  
**[0:23:11-0:23:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:23:11):**  which on the margin at a farm create some level of loss, but wouldn't justify putting  
**[0:23:19-0:23:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:23:19):**  devices on all those animals.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:23:21):**  But if you then all of a sudden you say, oh yeah, look, we saved 2% of your herd last  
**[0:23:27-0:23:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:23:27):**  year via these detections, that translates into a huge level of profitability for our  
**[0:23:32-0:23:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:23:32):**  customer base that otherwise they wouldn't have access to.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:23:36):**  And then we think there's like this off-farm potential as well.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:23:39):**  And this gets into where we think things may go, but like you're in a world now, and this  
**[0:23:45-0:23:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:23:45):**  is happening already in Australia, that where people are looking at rotational grazing and  
**[0:23:50-0:23:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:23:50):**  the way that animals are managed and saying, this is actually better for the landscape,  
**[0:23:54-0:23:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:23:54):**  this is better for the planet, and it's sequestering carbon.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:23:58):**  Yet there's no validation, right?  
**[0:24:02-0:24:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:24:02):**  There's no true thing of that other than somebody going out and sticking a tube in the ground  
**[0:24:07-0:24:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:24:07):**  and testing the soil right now.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:24:08):**  But really, you can actually say, hey, if we build a model and we can actually demonstrate  
**[0:24:14-0:24:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:24:14):**  that these animals were managed in this particular way, then this person was sequestering carbon  
**[0:24:20-0:24:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:24:20):**  in the soil and they should get paid for that.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:24:22):**  And so we think that there's also this ability for us to be an objective ground-truthing  
**[0:24:28-0:24:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:24:28):**  of the practices in which those animals were managed that will eventually create a lot  
**[0:24:34-0:24:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:24:34):**  of value for our customer base, as well as can be a kind of interesting source of, hey,  
**[0:24:40-0:24:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:24:40):**  was this meat sustainably raised in the future when you go to the supermarket, for example.  
**[0:24:45-0:24:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:24:45):**  And in terms of the land management, like the grazing itself, how can you help the farmer  
**[0:24:50-0:24:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:24:50):**  there to optimize that?  
**[0:24:52-0:24:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:24:52):**  Because of course, removing the fencing, suddenly you come into a whole flexibility world that  
**[0:24:57-0:24:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:24:57):**  also could be overwhelming.  
**[0:24:58-0:25:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:24:58):**  But it definitely, I mean, you talked about the grazing and the optimal timing to when  
**[0:25:02-0:25:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:25:02):**  the cows need to be on the grass and when they shouldn't.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:25:05):**  How do you help on that side of things?  
**[0:25:07-0:25:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:25:07):**  Or how could you, if you're not yet?  
**[0:25:09-0:25:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:25:09):**  Yeah, I think that one of the things, and this isn't intended to be pejorative, but  
**[0:25:16-0:25:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:25:16):**  I think that you want to take baby steps.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:25:18):**  You don't want to land somewhere and say, look, you need to go from 0 to 100 miles an  
**[0:25:27-0:25:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:25:27):**  hour in day one.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:25:29):**  You need to take customers along with you on your journey.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:25:33):**  And they need to be ready.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:25:35):**  And they will decide what their risk tolerance is for different things.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:25:39):**  And so as it relates to your question, a lot of times we're coming into farms and we're  
**[0:25:45-0:25:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:25:45):**  with customers who already have an idea of what they want to do.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:25:48):**  And it's great.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:25:50):**  They know their lands better than we do.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:25:52):**  Going into a farm and trying to pretend like I know better than somebody whose family has  
**[0:25:56-0:26:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:25:56):**  managed that land for hundreds of years would be the ultimate arrogance.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:26:01):**  But we do think that over time there is the ability for us to start to incorporate other  
**[0:26:08-0:26:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:26:08):**  data sources and the ability to say, look, like from satellite imagery, we can now tell  
**[0:26:12-0:26:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:26:12):**  you that this is what's going on with the forage in this pasture.  
**[0:26:15-0:26:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:26:15):**  You've got X number of animals.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:26:16):**  We can kind of give you a pretty good insight of like these animals should be moved from  
**[0:26:20-0:26:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:26:20):**  here to here at this point in time.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:26:22):**  Do you see farmers already doing that?  
**[0:26:24-0:26:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:26:24):**  Like they combined your set with some other sets they have or the drones images they use  
**[0:26:28-0:26:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:26:28):**  or their observation.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:26:29):**  They obviously use daily as they go over the land.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:26:32):**  It's a completely analog process at this point in time.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:26:36):**  It's something that most farmers are out looking at the land, looking at their animals and  
**[0:26:41-0:26:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:26:41):**  observing which I think is absolutely never going away.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:26:46):**  I think livestock farmers, part of why they're livestock farmers, they love the land.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:26:50):**  They want to be out there with the animals.  
**[0:26:51-0:26:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:26:51):**  It's a very peaceful kind of meditative, meditative lifestyle.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:26:58):**  So it's absolutely wonderful to be out in pasture with animals.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:27:02):**  I think that what they do right now is they're the ones who are out there and they're saying,  
**[0:27:06-0:27:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:27:06):**  yep, kind of feels like we should move.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:27:08):**  And then the question is like, how much of a pain is it for them to do that?  
**[0:27:14-0:27:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:27:14):**  And do they have any place to move them that is actually better than where they are?  
**[0:27:19-0:27:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:27:19):**  Or do they deal with a kind of suboptimal scenario currently because they're not going  
**[0:27:24-0:27:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:27:24):**  to put up two miles of fencing to just hold animals for another couple of days or something  
**[0:27:28-0:27:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:27:28):**  along those lines.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:27:29):**  Yeah.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:27:30):**  No, I see some people using these mobile fencing, like getting over squat and basically relatively  
**[0:27:36-0:27:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:27:36):**  fast but still very labor intensive, obviously getting some mobile electric fencing up and  
**[0:27:41-0:27:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:27:41):**  some even move.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:27:42):**  I mean, there are some of these systems that go up and down and move.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:27:45):**  Yeah.  
**[0:27:46-0:27:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:27:46):**  They're the tumbles.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:27:47):**  Yeah.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:27:48):**  That works in a perfectly groomed landscape.  
**[0:27:52-0:27:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:27:52):**  Yeah.  
**[0:27:55-0:27:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:27:55):**  Or also we look at the landscape, the customer.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:27:59):**  You can send them into a forest, obviously, as well.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:28:04):**  Exactly.  
**[0:28:05-0:28:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:28:05):**  Or if you look at the American West and you look at Montana or Idaho, you've got these  
**[0:28:12-0:28:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:28:12):**  ditches and draws that'll go down 20 feet in a matter of three or four meters.  
**[0:28:19-0:28:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:28:19):**  Right.  
**[0:28:20-0:28:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:28:20):**  So there's a massive change in landscape and putting fence line across that is actually  
**[0:28:25-0:28:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:28:25):**  really challenging and pretty impractical.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:28:28):**  What it enables our customers to do is just draw these imaginary lines and all of a sudden  
**[0:28:34-0:28:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:28:34):**  they become reality.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:28:35):**  They don't deal with any of the physical issues that are related to it.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:28:41):**  That's like when we think about what I think that you've got to have a couple different  
**[0:28:47-0:28:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:28:47):**  legs to stand on as it relates to getting adoption for your product.  
**[0:28:51-0:28:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:28:51):**  One of the legs that you have to stand on is you've got to change your customer's lifestyle.  
**[0:28:55-0:28:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:28:55):**  You have to make things better.  
**[0:28:58-0:29:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:28:58):**  It's got to be more profitable, but our customers are overworked to begin with.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:29:04):**  They don't have another couple hours in the day that they're just going to squeeze in  
**[0:29:07-0:29:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:29:07):**  something new and cool.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:29:09):**  It's like, how do we improve their quality of life as well as their productivity at the  
**[0:29:15-0:29:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:29:15):**  same time?  
**[0:29:17-0:29:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:29:17):**  When we talk to our customers, that's something that's also really apparent.  
**[0:29:22-0:29:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:29:22):**  They go, oh man, I was never able to do this.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:29:26):**  It would have been a complete pain to do.  
**[0:29:31-0:29:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:29:31):**  Now I'm able to get in.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:29:33):**  I can do it and I can get out there and do the things that I actually like, which I go  
**[0:29:36-0:29:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:29:36):**  out, be with the animals, take a look at what's going on in the field rather than constantly  
**[0:29:42-0:29:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:29:42):**  running to go repair the fence line that some bull ran through and tore down the fence line  
**[0:29:48-0:29:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:29:48):**  and the rest of the animals got out of the pasture.  
**[0:29:50-0:29:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:29:50):**  I spent the whole day regathering them.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:29:52):**  Which is a lot of time spent.  
**[0:29:55-0:29:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:29:55):**  Yeah.  
**[0:29:56-0:30:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:29:56):**  Nobody puts that into a spreadsheet and says, oh, my time is X and there was 10 hours lost.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:30:05):**  It happens daily or weekly on a livestock farm and it's just part of the unexpected  
**[0:30:12-0:30:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:30:12):**  nature of how things are managed.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:30:14):**  I think that one of the things that will happen with our system is we're going to enable this  
**[0:30:19-0:30:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:30:19):**  sense of predictability.  
**[0:30:20-0:30:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:30:20):**  We can say, look, I wake up, I know where my animals are.  
**[0:30:24-0:30:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:30:24):**  Even if one animal broke through the virtual fence line, I know where it is still because  
**[0:30:28-0:30:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:30:28):**  I'm tracking that animal.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:30:30):**  Yeah, because if the bull breaks through, it's not that the others follow like you normally  
**[0:30:34-0:30:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:30:34):**  have.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:30:35):**  Exactly.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:30:36):**  It doesn't ruin the fence line for the other animals.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:30:37):**  The other animals are still contained.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:30:42):**  Once customers get insight into that, it starts to make the bells go off in their minds as  
**[0:30:49-0:30:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:30:49):**  well of like, oh, this is actually really going to be game changing for us on a lifestyle  
**[0:30:54-0:30:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:30:54):**  perspective as well.  
**[0:30:55-0:30:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:30:55):**  I find it absolutely fascinating.  
**[0:30:58-0:31:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:30:58):**  I always like to put the companies of the interviewees we have here onto the ITN framework,  
**[0:31:04-0:31:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:31:04):**  which is importance, tractability and neglect sickness.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:31:07):**  And I think importance we covered.  
**[0:31:09-0:31:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:31:09):**  There's a billion heads of cattle out there, plus probably another 1.52 billion of other  
**[0:31:15-0:31:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:31:15):**  livestock.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:31:17):**  And the importance on land, both on the destruction and the potential side are just enormous.  
**[0:31:22-0:31:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:31:22):**  The tractability you mentioned as well, how solvable is this problem?  
**[0:31:27-0:31:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:31:27):**  How easy is it for the bull to get out or to just ignore it?  
**[0:31:30-0:31:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:31:30):**  Or how many of the colors don't work after a while or stop working?  
**[0:31:35-0:31:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:31:35):**  Or maybe what kind of reception do you need in the middle of nowhere where cell phone  
**[0:31:39-0:31:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:31:39):**  reception is already very tricky?  
**[0:31:40-0:31:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:31:40):**  I know many farms don't have broadband for that reason.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:31:44):**  How difficult is the technology and hardware piece in very challenging Montana, deep snow,  
**[0:31:49-0:31:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:31:49):**  et cetera, or very hot areas?  
**[0:31:51-0:31:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:31:51):**  How difficult is the tech part?  
**[0:31:53-0:31:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:31:53):**  It's a great question.  
**[0:31:54-0:31:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:31:54):**  I think that it's a double-edged sword because you want the problem to be really hard, but  
**[0:31:59-0:32:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:31:59):**  you want it to be solvable because if it's not really hard, then everybody's going to  
**[0:32:04-0:32:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:32:04):**  be able to do it and you don't have a great business.  
**[0:32:05-0:32:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:32:05):**  That's the next one.  
**[0:32:06-0:32:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:32:06):**  Yeah.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:32:07):**  How neglected is it?  
**[0:32:08-0:32:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:32:08):**  How many others are looking at this from other?  
**[0:32:10-0:32:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:32:10):**  Exactly.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:32:11):**  And so for us, one of the things that we did that I think kind of really differentiates  
**[0:32:16-0:32:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:32:16):**  us in the space, we'll get to the neglected view comment, but we looked at this as a communications  
**[0:32:21-0:32:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:32:21):**  platform and animal management and animal control is the application which sits on a  
**[0:32:26-0:32:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:32:26):**  communications platform.  
**[0:32:28-0:32:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:32:28):**  So we went to go build the company and resource the company in terms of what we needed to  
**[0:32:34-0:32:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:32:34):**  execute this.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:32:36):**  It was actually a communications hardware team that was able to build and design a communications  
**[0:32:43-0:32:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:32:43):**  product that works in these extremely challenged environments over huge spaces or huge swaths  
**[0:32:50-0:32:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:32:50):**  of land.  
**[0:32:52-0:33:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:32:52):**  And we managed to, I was kind of researching this as kind of the problem statement is like  
**[0:33:01-0:33:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:33:01):**  we need to have a highly reliable, very low cost, extremely large range communication  
**[0:33:11-0:33:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:33:11):**  system that works in areas that are sometimes in the middle of what looks like Mars.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:33:18):**  And I managed to stumble across, for better or for worse, I call it stumbled across a  
**[0:33:25-0:33:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:33:25):**  hardware solution when I was looking for that.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:33:28):**  And it was best in class solution.  
**[0:33:30-0:33:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:33:30):**  And the problem was their business model was just way too expensive for what we're going  
**[0:33:34-0:33:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:33:34):**  to do.  
**[0:33:35-0:33:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:33:35):**  It just would have eaten up all of the margin for our customers.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:33:37):**  There would have been no real application, no real business model other than simply a  
**[0:33:42-0:33:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:33:42):**  communications platform.  
**[0:33:44-0:33:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:33:44):**  And the business model of that company was actually what drove that company to fail.  
**[0:33:49-0:33:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:33:49):**  But the team that was behind building that was available at the time.  
**[0:33:54-0:33:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:33:54):**  And so I was able to pick off-  
**[0:33:56-0:33:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:33:56):**  After the bankruptcy.  
**[0:33:57-0:33:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:33:57):**  Yeah.  
**[0:33:58-0:33:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:33:58):**  After the failure.  
**[0:33:59-0:34:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:33:59):**  It was a-  
**[0:34:00-0:34:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:34:00):**  Well, as the company was really kind of starting to go down, I was able to bring the leader  
**[0:34:06-0:34:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:34:06):**  of that team really over to Vence and he was able to bring a number of his colleagues with  
**[0:34:11-0:34:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:34:11):**  him.  
**[0:34:12-0:34:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:34:12):**  And we were able to, in short order, really build a platform, which is what we built.  
**[0:34:19-0:34:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:34:19):**  And on that platform sits this animal communications app, this animal management application.  
**[0:34:25-0:34:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:34:25):**  I think thinking about it that way is actually our differentiation factor.  
**[0:34:29-0:34:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:34:29):**  It's our secret sauce as a company and the team, and how we built that.  
**[0:34:33-0:34:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:34:33):**  When you say platform, does it mean there's more than the color out there?  
**[0:34:36-0:34:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:34:36):**  Like I, as a farmer, have to install a pole or something to make it work?  
**[0:34:41-0:34:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:34:41):**  Or a platform is more a virtual term in this case?  
**[0:34:43-0:34:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:34:43):**  At this point in time, yeah, there's a pole.  
**[0:34:46-0:34:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:34:46):**  So he puts up a tower.  
**[0:34:47-0:34:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:34:47):**  What we do is we'll, any given customer will send us through what their farm map looks  
**[0:34:54-0:34:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:34:54):**  like and we basically will create a RF propagation map over that.  
**[0:34:58-0:35:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:34:58):**  So we'll basically say, hey, here's what a network coverage will look like.  
**[0:35:01-0:35:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:35:01):**  We need to put a pole here, here and here.  
**[0:35:04-0:35:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:35:04):**  And then we've built that system end to end to basically drop ship to that customer a  
**[0:35:13-0:35:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:35:13):**  solution set and tell them, hey, this needs to go here.  
**[0:35:17-0:35:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:35:17):**  And they're able to do that.  
**[0:35:19-0:35:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:35:19):**  It's pretty impressive.  
**[0:35:20-0:35:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:35:20):**  Yeah.  
**[0:35:21-0:35:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:35:21):**  That the team, you know, it's my background is not in engineering.  
**[0:35:24-0:35:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:35:24):**  So it's really a testament to everybody at the company except for me.  
**[0:35:28-0:35:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:35:28):**  That this actually works.  
**[0:35:30-0:35:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:35:30):**  Yeah.  
**[0:35:31-0:35:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:35:31):**  Yeah, it actually works.  
**[0:35:32-0:35:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:35:32):**  Absolutely, they continue to impress me in terms of the things that they make and continue  
**[0:35:37-0:35:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:35:37):**  to do.  
**[0:35:38-0:35:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:35:38):**  But to your question, the other thing is the reason we call it a platform is because when  
**[0:35:42-0:35:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:35:42):**  we look at it, animal management is one application, but like, you know, water monitoring sensors,  
**[0:35:49-0:35:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:35:49):**  soil sensors, they all need a communication platform.  
**[0:35:52-0:35:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:35:52):**  They all need to be able to plug into it.  
**[0:35:54-0:35:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:35:54):**  And when you look at, you know, this goes back to my previous comment about like, you  
**[0:35:58-0:36:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:35:58):**  know, a lot of these things that you could previously do with sensors, they don't justify  
**[0:36:02-0:36:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:36:02):**  the full deployment.  
**[0:36:04-0:36:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:36:04):**  All of a sudden, you've got a network there.  
**[0:36:06-0:36:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:36:06):**  And it's like, oh, yeah, we'll hook that into our network.  
**[0:36:08-0:36:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:36:08):**  We'll dial that in.  
**[0:36:09-0:36:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:36:09):**  And they generate your multiples of value for our customer base.  
**[0:36:15-0:36:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:36:15):**  But they're cheap plugins for us to basically add on to the network.  
**[0:36:20-0:36:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:36:20):**  And so we certainly kind of expect to expand into those over the over the coming years  
**[0:36:25-0:36:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:36:25):**  as well.  
**[0:36:26-0:36:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:36:26):**  And in terms of neglectiveness, how busy is the virtual fencing space?  
**[0:36:31-0:36:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:36:31):**  It's not very busy.  
**[0:36:33-0:36:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:36:33):**  So you know, there are...  
**[0:36:34-0:36:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:36:34):**  You can count them on one hand.  
**[0:36:35-0:36:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:36:35):**  Yeah, you can count less than one hand.  
**[0:36:39-0:36:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:36:39):**  We view there as being, again, there are a lot of companies that have built cattle tracking  
**[0:36:45-0:36:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:36:45):**  sensors.  
**[0:36:46-0:36:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:36:46):**  And I don't actually view that as competition.  
**[0:36:48-0:36:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:36:48):**  This isn't a dig against those companies.  
**[0:36:51-0:36:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:36:51):**  But when you look at an IoT network and an IoT platform, the ability to have uplink versus  
**[0:36:58-0:37:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:36:58):**  downlink, it's actually there's a complete imbalance.  
**[0:37:01-0:37:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:37:01):**  There's 16 times easier to report GPS data up to a network than it is to send information  
**[0:37:10-0:37:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:37:10):**  down to that device and control that device.  
**[0:37:13-0:37:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:37:13):**  And so when I dismiss those as non-competition, it's because they would have to build a completely  
**[0:37:20-0:37:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:37:20):**  different solution to get into the virtual fencing space.  
**[0:37:23-0:37:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:37:23):**  And so when you get into the virtual fencing space, there are really three competitors  
**[0:37:28-0:37:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:37:28):**  that we look at.  
**[0:37:29-0:37:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:37:29):**  There's Agresons out of Australia, Halter out of New Zealand, and NoFence out of Norway.  
**[0:37:35-0:37:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:37:35):**  And each of them have built different solutions.  
**[0:37:38-0:37:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:37:38):**  None of them at this point in time is commercially available.  
**[0:37:41-0:37:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:37:41):**  So we're kind of all sprinting towards commercial availability.  
**[0:37:47-0:37:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:37:47):**  Everybody has their different benefits and drawbacks.  
**[0:37:52-0:37:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:37:52):**  We should, in our opinion, be out in the forefront over the coming year.  
**[0:37:56-0:38:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:37:56):**  We should work back and put out 50,000 collars next year and cover two and a half million  
**[0:38:01-0:38:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:38:01):**  acres of land.  
**[0:38:02-0:38:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:38:02):**  And we think that that'll kind of squarely put us in the most commercially available  
**[0:38:07-0:38:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:38:07):**  solution there.  
**[0:38:09-0:38:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:38:09):**  But it's a space that when you're talking about a billion potential users just in the  
**[0:38:16-0:38:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:38:16):**  cattle-  
**[0:38:17-0:38:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:38:17):**  50,000 is nothing.  
**[0:38:19-0:38:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:38:19):**  50,000 is just not even scratching the edge of the surface.  
**[0:38:23-0:38:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:38:23):**  And so it's extremely neglected as a space and people looking at.  
**[0:38:27-0:38:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:38:27):**  I think that answers it nicely.  
**[0:38:29-0:38:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:38:29):**  I want to be conscious of your time and end with some, I think, fast questions.  
**[0:38:33-0:38:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:38:33):**  Let's see if we can manage and otherwise keep some for another episode.  
**[0:38:36-0:38:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:38:36):**  I apologize if I'm rambling.  
**[0:38:37-0:38:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:38:37):**  I get excited about some of these things.  
**[0:38:39-0:38:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:38:39):**  No, absolutely not.  
**[0:38:40-0:38:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:38:40):**  It's the first time we have virtual fencing.  
**[0:38:41-0:38:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:38:41):**  We've discussed it actually with Bert Clover once, but just scratching the surface again  
**[0:38:46-0:38:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:38:46):**  and never got into the real details.  
**[0:38:49-0:38:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:38:49):**  And so it's something I've been waiting for.  
**[0:38:50-0:38:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:38:50):**  So definitely want to ask about the details.  
**[0:38:53-0:38:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:38:53):**  But let's ask some questions.  
**[0:38:54-0:38:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:38:54):**  I always like to ask, what if you would be in charge of a hundred billion or one billion,  
**[0:38:58-0:39:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:38:58):**  sorry, one billion dollar investment fund tomorrow morning?  
**[0:39:01-0:39:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:39:01):**  What would your portfolio look like if you had complete freedom to invest it?  
**[0:39:05-0:39:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:39:05):**  So not granted.  
**[0:39:07-0:39:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:39:07):**  What would you put it to work and why?  
**[0:39:09-0:39:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:39:09):**  It's a good question.  
**[0:39:13-0:39:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:39:13):**  Since you have investors on this podcast that I'm saying I have to say throw it all in  
**[0:39:17-0:39:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:39:17):**  advance.  
**[0:39:18-0:39:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:39:18):**  No, that's a lot of colors.  
**[0:39:19-0:39:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:39:19):**  Yeah.  
**[0:39:20-0:39:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:39:20):**  I think that I would give it how deep I am in the space that I'm in, like in the understanding  
**[0:39:26-0:39:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:39:26):**  that I have.  
**[0:39:27-0:39:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:39:27):**  Most people invest a lot, like they feel more comfort investing what they know.  
**[0:39:31-0:39:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:39:31):**  And so I think what I would probably do, and I've thought about this, is there are a bunch  
**[0:39:37-0:39:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:39:37):**  of countries in the world that are really significant in the agriculture producing assets,  
**[0:39:41-0:39:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:39:41):**  both on the livestock and on the farmland.  
**[0:39:44-0:39:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:39:44):**  Brazil's a great example where their currency has been devalued by 50% in the last year.  
**[0:39:48-0:39:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:39:48):**  So I would actually spend 80% of that buying assets in those lands that are non regenerative  
**[0:39:54-0:39:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:39:54):**  and non kind of suboptimally producing.  
**[0:39:57-0:40:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:39:57):**  I'd probably spend 10% of it investing in ag tech.  
**[0:40:01-0:40:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:40:01):**  The tools.  
**[0:40:02-0:40:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:40:02):**  Yeah.  
**[0:40:03-0:40:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:40:03):**  Yeah.  
**[0:40:04-0:40:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:40:04):**  Tools to bring productivity up, you know, two to three times on this property.  
**[0:40:07-0:40:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:40:07):**  And then I'd probably spend the last 10% on like supply chain efficiencies and marketing  
**[0:40:11-0:40:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:40:11):**  to get those products into the higher value markets at a price point which captures their  
**[0:40:15-0:40:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:40:15):**  value.  
**[0:40:16-0:40:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:40:16):**  So I'd invest 80, 10, 10 along.  
**[0:40:18-0:40:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:40:18):**  Yeah.  
**[0:40:19-0:40:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:40:19):**  80, 10, 10 is how I'd look at it.  
**[0:40:20-0:40:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:40:20):**  And it's a very, very nice answer actually.  
**[0:40:23-0:40:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:40:23):**  And what if you could change one thing overnight in the ag space?  
**[0:40:26-0:40:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:40:26):**  So you have a magic wand and you Frank have the great power to change one single thing  
**[0:40:31-0:40:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:40:31):**  in the ag and food space.  
**[0:40:32-0:40:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:40:32):**  What would you do?  
**[0:40:33-0:40:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:40:33):**  Oh, that's a risky question there.  
**[0:40:37-0:40:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:40:37):**  Being in the US, the immediate thing that pops up is I'm like, oh, would I get rid of  
**[0:40:40-0:40:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:40:40):**  just corn subsidies?  
**[0:40:41-0:40:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:40:41):**  Which people have said, like take away all subsidies and let's figure it out.  
**[0:40:46-0:40:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:40:46):**  Yeah.  
**[0:40:47-0:40:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:40:47):**  I think I would actually enable a nutrient deficiency tax where you actually via a mechanism  
**[0:40:57-0:41:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:40:57):**  are charging like your bag of Cheetos cost you what a pack of cigarettes costs because  
**[0:41:04-0:41:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:41:04):**  of it's like of what's actually in that bag.  
**[0:41:07-0:41:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:41:07):**  Complete absence.  
**[0:41:08-0:41:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:41:08):**  Yeah.  
**[0:41:09-0:41:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:41:09):**  And so you'd get back to this sense that people are actually paying for what they're getting.  
**[0:41:15-0:41:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:41:15):**  Kind of false version of reality.  
**[0:41:18-0:41:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:41:18):**  I think it's a first actually to put somebody mentioned that, but it's a very I mean, policy  
**[0:41:23-0:41:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:41:23):**  has come back and forth and getting or getting the externality costs into it.  
**[0:41:27-0:41:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:41:27):**  I think a few people have mentioned that.  
**[0:41:28-0:41:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:41:28):**  And yeah, it's a false cheapness.  
**[0:41:30-0:41:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:41:30):**  We see it fall like it's empty calories.  
**[0:41:33-0:41:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:41:33):**  And we know it.  
**[0:41:34-0:41:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:41:34):**  Most people know it.  
**[0:41:35-0:41:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:41:35):**  And but it's still and most people like how do we give people the choice to actually switch  
**[0:41:39-0:41:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:41:39):**  to go for the nutrient density stuff?  
**[0:41:41-0:41:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:41:41):**  And it's going to be a carrot and a stick probably in mixed forms.  
**[0:41:44-0:41:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:41:44):**  But this is yeah, it's going to be one of the big challenges.  
**[0:41:47-0:41:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:41:47):**  How do we make sure people get what they pay for?  
**[0:41:50-0:41:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:41:50):**  I think it has to be a carrot and a stick because we're so smart as as humans that we've  
**[0:41:57-0:42:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:41:57):**  hacked the human taste bud.  
**[0:42:01-0:42:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:42:01):**  And we sold in fact, yeah, we basically completely circus circumvented reality.  
**[0:42:08-0:42:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:42:08):**  And like we're like, oh, look, we can hack the brain.  
**[0:42:10-0:42:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:42:10):**  So like, you know, we'll just sell people this and they don't they don't have, you know,  
**[0:42:16-0:42:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:42:16):**  they don't have any insight into it.  
**[0:42:17-0:42:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:42:17):**  So like the government like that, that would be the optimal version of where the government  
**[0:42:21-0:42:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:42:21):**  comes in and says, look, this is actually what is best for society in like, you're going  
**[0:42:27-0:42:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:42:27):**  to get charged a tax for that you can still smoke cigarettes.  
**[0:42:29-0:42:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:42:29):**  That's fine.  
**[0:42:30-0:42:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:42:30):**  However, like, you just not indoors.  
**[0:42:33-0:42:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:42:33):**  Yeah, you just not indoors.  
**[0:42:35-0:42:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:42:35):**  You got to pay a tax for it.  
**[0:42:36-0:42:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:42:36):**  That's just like reality.  
**[0:42:38-0:42:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:42:38):**  And this is definitely inspired by John Kempf.  
**[0:42:40-0:42:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:42:40):**  But what do you believe to be true about Regen ag that others don't believe to be true?  
**[0:42:46-0:42:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:42:46):**  Apart from that virtual fencing is the future.  
**[0:42:48-0:42:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:42:48):**  But that's maybe because most people didn't think about that, because they don't believe  
**[0:42:52-0:42:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:42:52):**  to be true.  
**[0:42:53-0:42:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:42:53):**  Do you have any strong feelings that others not share or the other way around?  
**[0:42:57-0:43:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:42:57):**  Yeah, well, I'm on a podcast with like, people who are listening, spending an hour to listen  
**[0:43:02-0:43:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:43:02):**  about like Regen ag investing.  
**[0:43:04-0:43:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:43:04):**  So to saying something that they don't already believe to be true is like, you're asking  
**[0:43:08-0:43:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:43:08):**  me to stretch a little bit here.  
**[0:43:09-0:43:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:43:09):**  I mean, that's why I ask it.  
**[0:43:11-0:43:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:43:11):**  Because I think if you talk about society at large, right, like it's that Regen ag is  
**[0:43:15-0:43:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:43:15):**  actually cheaper than commercial ag.  
**[0:43:17-0:43:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:43:17):**  I we could definitely stretch the others.  
**[0:43:19-0:43:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:43:19):**  This is an interesting one, because we have people listening that say, you cannot make  
**[0:43:22-0:43:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:43:22):**  money with Regen ag or with ag in general, like it's impossible because you will be squeezing  
**[0:43:27-0:43:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:43:27):**  something, etc.  
**[0:43:28-0:43:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:43:28):**  So you're saying it's cheaper?  
**[0:43:29-0:43:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:43:29):**  Explain?  
**[0:43:30-0:43:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:43:30):**  Yeah, I think it's like, why is harvesting corn so cheap?  
**[0:43:34-0:43:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:43:34):**  It's because of the tools that are used to harvest corn, right?  
**[0:43:38-0:43:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:43:38):**  You've got these massive combines that John Deere makes that are cost you millions of  
**[0:43:42-0:43:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:43:42):**  dollars, but they enable you to have scale to do it.  
**[0:43:45-0:43:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:43:45):**  And the thing that Regen ag lacks is tools.  
**[0:43:48-0:43:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:43:48):**  And so as soon as it has tools, it's going to be cheaper, in my opinion.  
**[0:43:51-0:43:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:43:51):**  So that's that I mean, I don't know that I'd imagine most people who are deep in Regen  
**[0:43:55-0:44:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:43:55):**  ag already believe that and that's like, yeah, but like, you know, that's my, I think it  
**[0:44:00-0:44:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:44:00):**  has to be cheaper.  
**[0:44:02-0:44:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:44:02):**  If you don't believe that, then you probably shouldn't be in the space.  
**[0:44:05-0:44:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:44:05):**  It has to be and it will be are two different things.  
**[0:44:07-0:44:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:44:07):**  I mean, it has to be, I mean, for a long time, it was solar energy has to be cheaper.  
**[0:44:11-0:44:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:44:11):**  Now in many places it is, but it took a while, I mean, took the tools to build it, the factories  
**[0:44:16-0:44:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:44:16):**  and the financing schemes, and of course, the subsidies as well.  
**[0:44:19-0:44:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:44:19):**  This is different in a good but like, we hope that it will be cheaper.  
**[0:44:23-0:44:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:44:23):**  And you're saying actually, with many customers, we see that it is fundamentally cheaper already  
**[0:44:26-0:44:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:44:26):**  with even the first version of the tools, not not even.  
**[0:44:30-0:44:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:44:30):**  I think solar is like such a great parallel, right?  
**[0:44:32-0:44:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:44:32):**  Like renewable energy is like, you look 20 years ago, and honestly, yeah, but like, if  
**[0:44:38-0:44:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:44:38):**  you look 20 years ago, the whole focus was like, there was a boom about like, you know,  
**[0:44:43-0:44:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:44:43):**  who can build the panels and then they built the tools.  
**[0:44:46-0:44:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:44:46):**  And they got to a point where they now the now the boom is gonna be a battery, right?  
**[0:44:50-0:44:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:44:50):**  Like you're already seeing it.  
**[0:44:53-0:44:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:44:53):**  The great thing about Regen ag is like, the batteries is soil.  
**[0:44:57-0:44:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:44:57):**  You don't need to build it.  
**[0:44:58-0:45:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:44:58):**  All we need to build is like the tools, the primary tool, which is the solar panels already  
**[0:45:02-0:45:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:45:02):**  built for you, like which is grass or the plant or the tree or whatever.  
**[0:45:08-0:45:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:45:08):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:45:09-0:45:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:45:09):**  The batteries already there, we just need to find like, the optimal ways to harvest  
**[0:45:13-0:45:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:45:13):**  it or to increase productivity of those.  
**[0:45:16-0:45:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:45:16):**  And then you're gonna have farms that are gonna make a lot more like it's it seems so  
**[0:45:20-0:45:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:45:20):**  much easier than the renewable energy thing where you have to build each of the components  
**[0:45:26-0:45:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:45:26):**  along the way, because they're man made versus nature's already spent millions of years AB  
**[0:45:32-0:45:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:45:32):**  testing, you know, in the in the word of the tech, ABCDF testing, probably.  
**[0:45:39-0:45:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:45:39):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:45:40-0:45:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:45:40):**  And so now, we've got the results of these millions of years of testing.  
**[0:45:43-0:45:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:45:43):**  And all we need to do is like, just get out there and do biomimicry, basically.  
**[0:45:47-0:45:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:45:47):**  Why do you see such a strong pushback then in articles on Regen ag will never be able  
**[0:45:51-0:45:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:45:51):**  and where the peer reviewed papers and an adaptive grazing I mean, savory is being harassed,  
**[0:45:57-0:46:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:45:57):**  I think every day in the press or in from university professors that it may never found  
**[0:46:02-0:46:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:46:02):**  a peer reviewed paper that it actually works.  
**[0:46:04-0:46:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:46:04):**  And then I always like to point out there are millions of farmers or hundreds of actually  
**[0:46:08-0:46:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:46:08):**  using it and it works like in their circumstances.  
**[0:46:11-0:46:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:46:11):**  Why is it so difficult to believe that you can actually build soil and eat from it and  
**[0:46:15-0:46:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:46:15):**  sort of have it have both of that like you can regenerate an asset, you can regenerate  
**[0:46:20-0:46:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:46:20):**  soil, and also grow food.  
**[0:46:23-0:46:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:46:23):**  This is going to be a whole different podcast now.  
**[0:46:25-0:46:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:46:25):**  But yeah, exactly.  
**[0:46:26-0:46:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:46:26):**  You're asking me like, do you have a short answer for that?  
**[0:46:29-0:46:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:46:29):**  Or should we keep it for another episode?  
**[0:46:31-0:46:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:46:31):**  You know, I don't know the answer to that.  
**[0:46:33-0:46:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:46:33):**  Like I wish I did.  
**[0:46:34-0:46:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:46:34):**  If I did, I would be focused on hacking that answer.  
**[0:46:36-0:46:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:46:36):**  Like, you know, I think it's one that a lot of times people find answers to the confirmation  
**[0:46:46-0:46:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:46:46):**  bias, right?  
**[0:46:47-0:46:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:46:47):**  People want to believe something.  
**[0:46:49-0:46:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:46:49):**  And so they go out and try and find answers to confirm what they already believed.  
**[0:46:52-0:46:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:46:52):**  And trust me, both sides of the party, both sides of the fence do that for a lot of things.  
**[0:46:56-0:46:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:46:56):**  But it's the proverbial fence, the virtual one.  
**[0:46:59-0:47:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:46:59):**  Exactly.  
**[0:47:00-0:47:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:47:00):**  But I think that a lot of times when you look at kind of people attacking savory, look,  
**[0:47:05-0:47:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:47:05):**  the challenge on ag is that it exists everywhere on the planet.  
**[0:47:10-0:47:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:47:10):**  So no two farms are actually the same.  
**[0:47:12-0:47:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:47:12):**  They don't have the same soils.  
**[0:47:14-0:47:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:47:14):**  They aren't necessarily producing the same product.  
**[0:47:16-0:47:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:47:16):**  And so if you apply the exact same results and tests from one place to another place,  
**[0:47:21-0:47:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:47:21):**  you may not get the same answer, which when it gets to a simplistic scientific method  
**[0:47:28-0:47:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:47:28):**  version of the world, all of a sudden you say, oh, that doesn't work because it didn't  
**[0:47:31-0:47:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:47:31):**  work.  
**[0:47:32-0:47:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:47:32):**  You know, I took this here and I translated this test from here to from A to Y and it  
**[0:47:37-0:47:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:47:37):**  doesn't work.  
**[0:47:38-0:47:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:47:38):**  So that means it doesn't work.  
**[0:47:39-0:47:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:47:39):**  No, it doesn't mean that.  
**[0:47:40-0:47:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:47:40):**  It just means you're actually dealing with nuance and you need to take a holistic view  
**[0:47:46-0:47:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:47:46):**  of the problem that you're looking at and incorporate all the variables into your test.  
**[0:47:52-0:47:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:47:52):**  And so I think that that's like that's what happens in a lot of like these peer review  
**[0:47:57-0:47:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:47:57):**  papers that will attack savory.  
**[0:47:59-0:48:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:47:59):**  Like, listen, savory's method doesn't work exactly the same everywhere.  
**[0:48:04-0:48:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:48:04):**  It doesn't grazing doesn't work the same in New Zealand as it works in northern Queensland,  
**[0:48:09-0:48:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:48:09):**  which are not that far apart.  
**[0:48:11-0:48:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:48:11):**  Like, you know, the same methodology doesn't work in the US.  
**[0:48:15-0:48:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:48:15):**  Exactly.  
**[0:48:16-0:48:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:48:16):**  So you need tweaks.  
**[0:48:17-0:48:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:48:17):**  You need tools to enable customers to adapt to their landscape and to the climate.  
**[0:48:23-0:48:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:48:23):**  And I think that the answer summarily is like it's being able to take a holistic view on  
**[0:48:31-0:48:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:48:31):**  it and that that our customers, the producers are the ones who I would listen to.  
**[0:48:37-0:48:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:48:37):**  Right.  
**[0:48:38-0:48:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:48:38):**  If they don't go and spend money on practices that don't translate to their bottom line,  
**[0:48:43-0:48:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:48:43):**  they don't they don't have the ability to go and risk their money on something that  
**[0:48:50-0:48:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:48:50):**  goes against social norms to begin with.  
**[0:48:53-0:48:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:48:53):**  If it doesn't make sense.  
**[0:48:54-0:48:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:48:54):**  If it doesn't make sense for them, it's not going to work for them.  
**[0:48:57-0:49:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:48:57):**  And so I think that's absolutely who I trust and what drives me and kind of our North Star  
**[0:49:03-0:49:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:49:03):**  is like, listen, our producer saying this works or are we telling them it works?  
**[0:49:08-0:49:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:49:08):**  What's reality?  
**[0:49:09-0:49:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:49:09):**  I know that's a big difference.  
**[0:49:10-0:49:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:49:10):**  And do they reorder?  
**[0:49:11-0:49:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:49:11):**  Look, Frank, I want to thank you so much for your time, for sharing.

**[0:52:09-0:52:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:52:09):**  that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very different means.  
**[0:52:13-0:52:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:52:13):**  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[0:52:18-0:52:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:52:18):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[0:52:21-0:52:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:52:21):**  Thank you.  
**[0:52:22-0:52:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:52:22):**  So what is this course?  
**[0:52:23-0:52:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:52:23):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  
**[0:52:30-0:52:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:52:30):**  so you don't have to write along.  
**[0:52:32-0:52:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:52:32):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:52:37-0:52:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:52:37):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:52:42-0:52:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:52:42):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[0:52:47-0:52:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:52:47):**  if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:52:48-0:52:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:52:48):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:52:53-0:52:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:52:53):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:52:57-0:53:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:52:57):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:53:02-0:53:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:53:02):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:53:03-0:53:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:53:03):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:53:05-0:53:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:53:05):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:53:07-0:53:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:53:07):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:53:11-0:53:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:53:11):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:53:13-0:53:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:53:13):**  Before making any investment please find professional investment advice.  
**[0:53:18-0:53:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/12/08/frank-wooten#t=0:53:18):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking.

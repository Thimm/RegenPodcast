**[0:00:35-0:00:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:00:35):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture, Investing as if  
**[0:00:41-0:00:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:00:41):**  the Planet Mattered, a podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative  
**[0:00:45-0:00:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:00:45):**  food and agriculture space to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate  
**[0:00:50-0:00:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:00:50):**  soil, people, local communities and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:56-0:00:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:00:56):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:59-0:01:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:00:59):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:02-0:01:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:01:02):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:01:05):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much  
**[0:01:10-0:01:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:01:10):**  more attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.

**[0:01:39-0:01:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:01:39):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:01:40):**  A very warm welcome to this Q&A webinar with Phil and Brendan of Perennial Fund and MAD  
**[0:01:45-0:01:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:01:45):**  Agriculture.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:01:46):**  I think it's one of the episodes I've shared the most because you have been on a webinar  
**[0:01:51-0:01:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:01:51):**  before, but the episode we recorded with Benedict skin in the game, transition finance has been  
**[0:01:56-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:01:56):**  something that somehow came up so many times in different conversations with many people.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:02:00):**  And I always said, just listen to this, read the white paper and something is happening  
**[0:02:04-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:02:04):**  there and something has definitely been happening there.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:02:07):**  And so I was very happy to see, of course, the closure of your fund.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:02:11):**  We're going to talk about that, but also just to check in, to see where you're at and to  
**[0:02:15-0:02:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:02:15):**  give the podcast community the chance to ask you questions and see what they can learn.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:02:21):**  What can we learn in other places around the world?  
**[0:02:22-0:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:02:22):**  Because you're very place and context specific, but my hunch is that we're going to see a  
**[0:02:27-0:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:02:27):**  lot of perennial fund like models around the world over the next years.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:02:31):**  And so I'm very much looking forward to that.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:02:34):**  I would love to start just with a brief we're now in, I mean, apart from that, you have  
**[0:02:38-0:02:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:02:38):**  a meat, a food of snow, but just to give a bit of context where you're at now, what does  
**[0:02:42-0:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:02:42):**  your days at the moment look like?  
**[0:02:44-0:02:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:02:44):**  We're at the 20th of April for anybody that's looking at this recording.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:02:48):**  What does a day in the life of a perennial fund at the moment look like and where do  
**[0:02:52-0:02:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:02:52):**  we find you in what state of mind at the moment?  
**[0:02:55-0:03:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:02:55):**  I would say maybe some vital energy, a little frantic, you know, trying to just dig in and  
**[0:03:01-0:03:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:03:01):**  really do the work.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:03:02):**  We've been heads down, just delivering, finding farmers, underwriting, getting loans out,  
**[0:03:08-0:03:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:03:08):**  thinking about growth for hiring a couple of people and struggling to find, I think  
**[0:03:14-0:03:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:03:14):**  a little bit of spaciousness to really think cognizantly about the next, you know, 24 hours  
**[0:03:20-0:03:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:03:20):**  and week and months.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:03:22):**  So we were just sitting down before this and sort of scrambling a little bit to even hop  
**[0:03:27-0:03:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:03:27):**  online.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:03:28):**  And I was like, my goodness, I'm not even sure what I'm going to say.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:03:30):**  You know what I mean?  
**[0:03:31-0:03:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:03:31):**  I just like just totally in the trenches, you know, there is spaciousness in the office  
**[0:03:36-0:03:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:03:36):**  at moments where I feel like the camaraderie and the harmonization of our work has some  
**[0:03:41-0:03:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:03:41):**  really awesome moments that kind of pull us deeper into the cycle together.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:03:46):**  But day in and day out, it's a lot of turning the wheel and getting work done.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:03:50):**  I feel like we're already, you know, four months into the year and yeah, we're just  
**[0:03:55-0:03:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:03:55):**  in stride.  
**[0:03:56-0:04:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:03:56):**  That's a lot of the energy is just that in that stride mode, you know, I'm usually sort  
**[0:04:00-0:04:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:04:00):**  of I have been flow personally through these more spacious moments and more dialed kind  
**[0:04:05-0:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:04:05):**  of concentrated moments of focus and I'm in a focus mode.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:04:10):**  As the world wakes up out of COVID and as the spring comes to the northern hemisphere,  
**[0:04:15-0:04:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:04:15):**  I just feel myself awakening with the spring, you know, from the inside out.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:04:20):**  And I've started my almost daily Creek dips, I dip in Boulder Creek, a little bit of Wim  
**[0:04:25-0:04:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:04:25):**  Hoff, a little bit of Kundalini yoga.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:04:28):**  And that has brought a lot of life back to my spirit.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:04:32):**  So I expect to see spaciousness in the future.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:04:35):**  But right now it's definitely hand over fist and getting the work done.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:04:39):**  And just to give a bit of context, when did the official closing was at the 10 million  
**[0:04:44-0:04:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:04:44):**  and how many loans are already out of the door?  
**[0:04:47-0:04:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:04:47):**  What is that grinding the wheel?  
**[0:04:48-0:04:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:04:48):**  What does that mean at the moment?  
**[0:04:50-0:04:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:04:50):**  How many farmers have been touched?  
**[0:04:52-0:04:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:04:52):**  Yep, good question.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:04:53):**  I think the official date was February 15.  
**[0:04:56-0:05:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:04:56):**  So we had to kind of extend a couple times to just account for unforeseen documentation,  
**[0:05:04-0:05:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:05:04):**  people needing a little more time.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:05:05):**  And February 15, we closed the fund at a full 10 million from 43 investors, mostly US based,  
**[0:05:12-0:05:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:05:12):**  but we have folks from seven different countries, Switzerland, Australia, Singapore, the Netherlands,  
**[0:05:20-0:05:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:05:20):**  England, all over.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:05:22):**  So it's been great to involve everyone.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:05:24):**  And yeah, we've gotten four loans out the door so far, a farm in Montana, and then three  
**[0:05:29-0:05:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:05:29):**  farms in Minnesota.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:05:31):**  So transitioning about 3400 acres up in Montana this year, and then a potential for a couple  
**[0:05:37-0:05:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:05:37):**  thousand starting next season that they have kind of an options contract on.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:05:42):**  And then with the three farms in Minnesota, I think it totals about 800 to 150 acres that  
**[0:05:48-0:05:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:05:48):**  they're going to be begin transitioning.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:05:50):**  So it's been really cool to, to dive in with these specific farmers.  
**[0:05:55-0:05:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:05:55):**  I'm not going to mention them by name yet until I have their full permission and such.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:05:59):**  And I think we're going to see them on the news, etc. as well.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:06:02):**  Probably will.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:06:03):**  Yeah.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:06:04):**  But they're highly diversified.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:06:05):**  They grow 10 to 15 different crops.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:06:08):**  They raise animals, they're highly integrated leaders in the movement, willing to share  
**[0:06:13-0:06:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:06:13):**  their learnings.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:06:14):**  And it's honestly just been a blast and a blessing getting to know them over the last,  
**[0:06:19-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:06:19):**  you know, few months in a deeper way as we've dug into the financials, created forecasted  
**[0:06:23-0:06:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:06:23):**  models for them, already started setting up crop contracts with a couple of them as well.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:06:28):**  So we're already starting to see kind of our system of change really move in and, you know,  
**[0:06:34-0:06:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:06:34):**  help them with financing, technical assistance and markets.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:06:38):**  And we've even started bridging them community wise.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:06:41):**  One was looking to buy some, some feed from a neighbor.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:06:45):**  They were just looking and asking us, you know, do you know where I can get some non-GMO  
**[0:06:49-0:06:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:06:49):**  feed?  
**[0:06:50-0:06:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:06:50):**  We connected them with one of our other farmers who were in the midst of underwriting and  
**[0:06:54-0:06:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:06:54):**  now they're setting up a contract between one another.  
**[0:06:57-0:07:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:06:57):**  So we're already starting to see this community as well take shape.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:07:00):**  And that's, it's been really encouraging considering we only have four farmers in so far.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:07:05):**  And also interesting that they were relatively nearby.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:07:07):**  And do you see that as these, let's say pioneering farmers, which was a very deliberate choice  
**[0:07:11-0:07:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:07:11):**  of you to partner with them.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:07:13):**  I'm imagining, but it's just an imagination looking at, let's say pioneering companies  
**[0:07:17-0:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:07:17):**  and startups, et cetera, that they have choice of where to get funding from.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:07:21):**  Is that the case actually?  
**[0:07:23-0:07:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:07:23):**  That's the first hypothesis.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:07:24):**  And then second, why do they pick to work with you or isn't there actually too many,  
**[0:07:28-0:07:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:07:28):**  aren't there too many options for pioneer farmers like these to go faster, to do more  
**[0:07:33-0:07:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:07:33):**  and do they sort of naturally flow or come to you?  
**[0:07:36-0:07:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:07:36):**  Yeah, good question.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:07:38):**  These farmers in particular, I'd say two of them had a choice as to where they could go  
**[0:07:43-0:07:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:07:43):**  for financing.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:07:44):**  They had an array of options that they could have chosen from, but they really wanted to  
**[0:07:48-0:07:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:07:48):**  dive in with us for kind of the values alignment, our understanding of just we get what they're  
**[0:07:54-0:07:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:07:54):**  doing and we want the future to be regenerative and organic and other bankers they're surrounded  
**[0:07:59-0:08:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:07:59):**  by don't understand it.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:08:01):**  They don't necessarily want that.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:08:03):**  And they're only throwing money at the problem, whereas we're trying to surround them with  
**[0:08:06-0:08:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:08:06):**  much more.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:08:07):**  I'm trying to pull up a quote here, but my internet's not working.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:08:11):**  It's been fascinating to sort of try to disrupt the conventional banking system.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:08:16):**  I mean, we've realized that in getting closer to that moment when you sign the dotted line  
**[0:08:21-0:08:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:08:21):**  with an alone agreement, when the community banks get involved, it's just the power between  
**[0:08:26-0:08:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:08:26):**  the borrower and the lender is so out of balance.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:08:29):**  The lender has all the control and they love to have that control.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:08:33):**  And so when push comes to shove, the farmer realizes that, you know, maybe my bank will  
**[0:08:38-0:08:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:08:38):**  fund me through organic transition.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:08:40):**  And then when they really kind of push up against the bank, the bank's like, no way  
**[0:08:44-0:08:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:08:44):**  we're going to do this.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:08:45):**  And so someone that's been with them for often a generation or two in their bank as a banking  
**[0:08:50-0:08:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:08:50):**  partner is all of a sudden sort of not able to support them.  
**[0:08:55-0:08:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:08:55):**  And then that's where there's sort of almost like a pivotal shift, which can happen in  
**[0:08:59-0:09:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:08:59):**  the matter of days where it's like, my goodness, I realize I'm part of a system that I'm deeply  
**[0:09:03-0:09:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:09:03):**  mal-aligned with.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:09:06):**  And you know, the perennial funds here.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:09:07):**  And then what we've actually been doing is that in some of those cases where the bank  
**[0:09:11-0:09:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:09:11):**  won't, you know, free up, they have a blanket lien on the farm, they won't free up any collateral,  
**[0:09:16-0:09:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:09:16):**  there's no partnership opportunity.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:09:18):**  We ended up just taking the entire operating line.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:09:20):**  So rather than just doing transitional acres, like we intended to do, we just take the entire  
**[0:09:26-0:09:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:09:26):**  operating note for the farm.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:09:27):**  And then that gives us, that gives the farmer full freedom, you know, to sort of partner  
**[0:09:32-0:09:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:09:32):**  with us in that kind of vision of expression of ag and transition.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:09:35):**  And it frees them from those bank obligations, which creates a lot of liberty.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:09:39):**  We're taking on more risk than we had imagined doing, but it's actually part of the fund  
**[0:09:44-0:09:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:09:44):**  and what we feel like needs to happen.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:09:45):**  And I've got a quote from one of the farmers that we just funded in Minnesota.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:09:49):**  He said, it's almost surreal that we finally found people like Madag and your whole team  
**[0:09:53-0:09:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:09:53):**  that really gets what we do and want to further understand this process of regenerative, organic,  
**[0:09:58-0:10:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:09:58):**  direct consumer, next generation farming.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:10:01):**  We are beyond excited to look at the opportunities that we have become available.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:10:04):**  We've had our heads down for 20 plus years doing what we knew it was right in our hearts,  
**[0:10:08-0:10:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:10:08):**  but nobody cared.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:10:09):**  Like I said the other day, the local bankers have thoughts for years.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:10:12):**  They just think this is a fad and that we'll eventually give up and go the way of everybody  
**[0:10:17-0:10:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:10:17):**  else.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:10:18):**  It's great to be in company with you all looking forward to the future.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:10:22):**  So it's yeah, I see applause coming from Sarah.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:10:25):**  Yeah.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:10:26):**  And I mean, for us, those kinds of testimonials are everything.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:10:28):**  I mean, we live in service to our conscience, the land and the farmer.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:10:32):**  That's what we're in service to.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:10:34):**  And when the farmer is coming back with that kind of feedback, it really reinforces our  
**[0:10:40-0:10:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:10:40):**  approach, our philosophy, the work that's happening.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:10:44):**  And frankly, it's inspiring, keeps me up doing the good work.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:10:47):**  So when we have testimonies like that, it's becoming a long list now, which is great,  
**[0:10:52-0:10:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:10:52):**  which is good.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:10:53):**  And with that, I think I want to open it up to questions.  
**[0:10:56-0:10:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:10:56):**  Definitely put them in the chat if you have them.  
**[0:10:57-0:11:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:10:57):**  I'm going to give the word to Brian actually, who was the one who sent a number of questions,  
**[0:11:02-0:11:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:11:02):**  but you can pick one to start, right, otherwise we're going to overwhelm Phil and Brendan.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:11:06):**  But you had a nice list.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:11:07):**  So if you pick one, which one would you fire at them?  
**[0:11:10-0:11:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:11:10):**  Maybe just quickly a little bit of background first.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:11:13):**  Originally from Iowa, Southeast Iowa, have a small operation there, family farm, 600  
**[0:11:21-0:11:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:11:21):**  acres, corn, soybeans, pigs, as the flavor of Iowa is, of course, based in Switzerland  
**[0:11:28-0:11:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:11:28):**  and now lived and worked in agriculture my whole life, mostly working in the industry,  
**[0:11:34-0:11:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:11:34):**  especially in the input side, crop protection, fertilizer, soil amendments, so on and so  
**[0:11:40-0:11:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:11:40):**  forth.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:11:41):**  So from a very practical standpoint, as a landowner, as an input supplier, as somebody  
**[0:11:47-0:11:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:11:47):**  that's been in the traditional conventional production systems that frankly, you guys  
**[0:11:56-0:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:11:56):**  are looking to disrupt or transition into organic systems, a lot of things come up as  
**[0:12:03-0:12:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:12:03):**  questions of how feasible is this?  
**[0:12:07-0:12:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:12:07):**  How scalable is it?  
**[0:12:09-0:12:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:12:09):**  Certainly for, let's say, a niche product or making some connections between a producer  
**[0:12:15-0:12:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:12:15):**  and a processor or even consumer, retailer, you can foresee, especially the pioneers,  
**[0:12:22-0:12:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:12:22):**  as Koen said, that you can really find some pioneers and fast adopters and get started.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:12:30):**  But I think the way you guys talk, your ambitions are not listed or limited to a niche business  
**[0:12:37-0:12:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:12:37):**  or a niche effort.  
**[0:12:39-0:12:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:12:39):**  So beyond all the success stories, beyond the initial traction, where do you see this  
**[0:12:47-0:12:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:12:47):**  long term?  
**[0:12:48-0:12:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:12:48):**  I mean, how big a driver is this movement to organic farming?  
**[0:12:54-0:12:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:12:54):**  Great question.  
**[0:12:55-0:12:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:12:55):**  We know that organic farming is less than 1% on an acreage basis of the US.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:12:59):**  And so it is just sort of a blip and a drop in the bucket.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:13:03):**  However, it has double digit year on year growth.  
**[0:13:06-0:13:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:13:06):**  And we feel like a chemical free organic agriculture is the type of agriculture that we can stand  
**[0:13:12-0:13:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:13:12):**  behind.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:13:13):**  And we're finding that the very front edge of that movement needs as much support as  
**[0:13:19-0:13:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:13:19):**  it possibly can get.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:13:21):**  And so our sort of philosophy of change is a few today, many tomorrow.  
**[0:13:25-0:13:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:13:25):**  The idea that farmers listen to farmers.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:13:27):**  And so trying to reform the colossal industrial commodity thing, like there's so many people  
**[0:13:32-0:13:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:13:32):**  trying to do, is less of an interest.  
**[0:13:35-0:13:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:13:35):**  It's more about creating a new system that ends up attracting a lot of people in sort  
**[0:13:40-0:13:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:13:40):**  of a landslide shift over time.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:13:42):**  And so our focus is sort of trusting that grassroots theory of change where farmers  
**[0:13:48-0:13:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:13:48):**  look at other farmers across the fence line, they talk in cafes, and it's going to take  
**[0:13:53-0:14:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:13:53):**  a number of decades for us to really sort of create the seedbed for this revolution.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:14:00):**  But we feel like it's already afoot.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:14:03):**  And there's a bit of a patience game with it.  
**[0:14:05-0:14:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:14:05):**  And I think it's hard to sort of show up and offer a solution to every farmer right now.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:14:10):**  Like you might find precision ag doing, there's a bunch of different kind of technological  
**[0:14:14-0:14:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:14:14):**  things coming out and input efficiency things.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:14:17):**  But if you're not kind of questioning and living from the deeper virtues and the desire  
**[0:14:21-0:14:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:14:21):**  around diversification and being aspirational, it's really difficult to change the system.  
**[0:14:27-0:14:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:14:27):**  So we typically focus again on these kind of pioneering farmers because our belief is  
**[0:14:33-0:14:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:14:33):**  that regenerative organic ag truly creates more financial and ecological wealth.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:14:38):**  So win-win for the pocketbook and for the environment.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:14:42):**  And if that is true and we can show it through farmer transformation, through science, through  
**[0:14:47-0:14:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:14:47):**  data, through storytelling, then that at the end of the day will win out, but it's going  
**[0:14:51-0:14:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:14:51):**  to take some time.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:14:52):**  I'm not sure if that answers your question, but it's sort of human approach that we take  
**[0:14:56-0:15:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:14:56):**  that requires a bit of patience for creating transformation at the system scale.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:15:01):**  Yeah.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:15:02):**  And I'd also say to build on that, though it's a really small market, I think if we  
**[0:15:05-0:15:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:15:05):**  can provide kind of the right community of change and system of change to surround those  
**[0:15:10-0:15:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:15:10):**  who could be encouraged to change, if we reduce the amount of friction that's currently there,  
**[0:15:16-0:15:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:15:16):**  whether that's access to the right markets, to financing, to just having a neighbor that's  
**[0:15:21-0:15:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:15:21):**  also doing it, we will hopefully be able to also grow the rate that the market is changing  
**[0:15:28-0:15:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:15:28):**  and the rate that consumers are able to access the right types of products, the rate that  
**[0:15:33-0:15:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:15:33):**  acres are able to make it too organic with less of a hurdle or a trough to go through.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:15:39):**  So hopefully we can also encourage the market to start expanding significantly over the  
**[0:15:44-0:15:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:15:44):**  next five to 10 years.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:15:45):**  There's also a tremendous amount of frustration within the farm community, which is expressed  
**[0:15:50-0:15:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:15:50):**  in all sorts of interesting ways, whether it's deterioration of rural economy, whether  
**[0:15:55-0:16:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:15:55):**  it's big ag in your pocketbook, whether it's the lack of flexibility to grow what you want  
**[0:16:00-0:16:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:16:00):**  to grow, whether it's the inability to have livestock and crops integrated.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:16:04):**  The farm family desires something very different than what is.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:16:09):**  And I think with the farmers we work with, it takes a little while to sort of scrub that  
**[0:16:13-0:16:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:16:13):**  light bulb off and get to that more kind of like the heart of the matter, because that  
**[0:16:18-0:16:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:16:18):**  requires emotional tools, requires psychological tools, requires a really profound understanding  
**[0:16:23-0:16:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:16:23):**  of the self within the arc of what it means to be in the Midwest.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:16:28):**  And our approach, which we call pathfinding, after someone on boards to our capital, our  
**[0:16:33-0:16:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:16:33):**  markets or our kind of land and business planning, we anchor into this kind of deeper, more soulful,  
**[0:16:39-0:16:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:16:39):**  story based kind of relationship with the farmer where we know the matriarch and the  
**[0:16:44-0:16:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:16:44):**  patriarch and the kids and who's dying and who's getting married.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:16:48):**  And like we get texts from farmers.  
**[0:16:50-0:16:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:16:50):**  And what we learn is that there's kind of like a virtue in humanity that wants to be  
**[0:16:54-0:16:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:16:54):**  expressed in community and on the land that I feel like what we're offering provides a  
**[0:16:59-0:17:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:16:59):**  roadmap to.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:17:01):**  And that I think could be extraordinary in terms of creating rapid adoption.  
**[0:17:06-0:17:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:17:06):**  How we do that, I don't exactly know.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:17:08):**  We're trying.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:17:09):**  But for one thing, I know that it resonates and it resonates in a way that's more powerful  
**[0:17:14-0:17:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:17:14):**  than what's already out there.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:17:15):**  And so we're going to keep following that.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:17:18):**  Great.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:17:19):**  Maybe mind a follow up?  
**[0:17:22-0:17:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:17:22):**  Go ahead and then we have a few other questions starting to come in through the chat, but  
**[0:17:26-0:17:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:17:26):**  we have time.  
**[0:17:27-0:17:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:17:27):**  So just maybe an adjacent question to that one.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:17:32):**  A lot of times when we're talking about the food system, especially there's a lot of negativity  
**[0:17:37-0:17:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:17:37):**  around that discussion.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:17:38):**  You know, it's broken.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:17:40):**  Big Egg is polluting this and that.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:17:42):**  The farmers are doing this wrong.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:17:44):**  It's always coming from the, this is my opinion now, but it's always coming from the producer's  
**[0:17:49-0:17:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:17:49):**  side.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:17:50):**  The producer needs to change.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:17:51):**  They need to produce more organic or more regenerative.  
**[0:17:54-0:17:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:17:54):**  And it's always the producer first discussion.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:17:59):**  When the producers are selling into a market, obviously, and if there's demand in that market,  
**[0:18:04-0:18:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:18:04):**  then they'll respond to those demand signals, those price signals, whatever else.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:18:09):**  So where can the most leverage on the system be applied?  
**[0:18:13-0:18:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:18:13):**  Is it by changing producers and disrupting Big Egg or would it be better to work more  
**[0:18:21-0:18:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:18:21):**  on the demand side and get more Walmarts, more general meals, more individual chefs  
**[0:18:28-0:18:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:18:28):**  and consumers to be promoting a different system?  
**[0:18:33-0:18:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:18:33):**  I think Luke Smith's on this call, but he once told me, I used to use the word levers  
**[0:18:36-0:18:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:18:36):**  of change and it's more like nodal points.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:18:38):**  You know what I mean?  
**[0:18:39-0:18:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:18:39):**  It's an ecosystem that requires catalytic change by hitting pieces.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:18:43):**  So it's not one thing to the exclusion of others.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:18:47):**  And so what we feel like are sort of the three big nodal points in the system are capital,  
**[0:18:53-0:18:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:18:53):**  community and markets.  
**[0:18:55-0:19:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:18:55):**  And we try to hold those together in a holistic system of change.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:19:00):**  And I think markets, as you were talking about, is absolutely critical.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:19:03):**  We're building on our markets team now, hiring one, hopefully two people within the next  
**[0:19:07-0:19:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:19:07):**  two months to really try to work on that demand side.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:19:11):**  There's obviously an enormous number of brands and buyers, supplies, shed intermediaries  
**[0:19:15-0:19:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:19:15):**  that are values aligned, but there's an extremely high friction between the folks that want  
**[0:19:20-0:19:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:19:20):**  to buy and where they can actually source from.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:19:23):**  Like last night, we were on a call with a farmer.  
**[0:19:25-0:19:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:19:25):**  It was the first time the farmer had ever actually met someone who might be buying their  
**[0:19:29-0:19:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:19:29):**  food and selling it for human consumption.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:19:31):**  Everything they've done since they can remember has been corn beans and alfalfa.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:19:36):**  And so these farmers we love dearly, it was like their first time getting to know a totally  
**[0:19:41-0:19:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:19:41):**  new opportunity in life.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:19:42):**  That's how disconnected the eater and the farmer is.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:19:46):**  And so yeah, the demand side is huge.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:19:48):**  We say it around here, it's like, some farmers need Twitter, some farmers need capital, some  
**[0:19:52-0:19:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:19:52):**  farmers need a land or business plan, but every farmer needs a market.  
**[0:19:56-0:19:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:19:56):**  And it is like the thing that's universal.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:19:59):**  And so we are doubling down on that as a team this year and hiring.  
**[0:20:03-0:20:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:20:03):**  We've got Tanner and Jane here working the storytelling, what we call mutually beneficial  
**[0:20:08-0:20:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:20:08):**  contracting with full transparency across the supply shed.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:20:12):**  I can keep going, but I'm going to resist so we can get to other questions.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:20:14):**  I want to first go to a second question or a question that came in on the chat of Danica,  
**[0:20:20-0:20:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:20:20):**  which is an interesting issue.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:20:21):**  She's just working with a farmer that seems to be too far along.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:20:25):**  Basically the problem that people want to help the transition and have this beautiful  
**[0:20:29-0:20:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:20:29):**  before and after picture, which means before should be pretty bad and after should be pretty  
**[0:20:34-0:20:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:20:34):**  biterverse, full of trees, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:20:36):**  I mean, we all know those.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:20:37):**  And you partner with the pioneers that are 20 years down the line already.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:20:42):**  Any advice, creative ways, retroactively reward a farmer?  
**[0:20:45-0:20:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:20:45):**  What's your response there?  
**[0:20:46-0:20:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:20:46):**  Yeah, a couple of thoughts.  
**[0:20:49-0:20:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:20:49):**  One, I really like what Regen Network is.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:20:51):**  I'm not a big ecosystem service sort of markets person.  
**[0:20:54-0:20:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:20:54):**  The word service is utilitarian.  
**[0:20:56-0:21:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:20:56):**  I think we've got to philosophically evolve beyond the whole thing.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:21:00):**  But a Regen Network is doing the idea of sort of selling aggregate ecosystem expression,  
**[0:21:06-0:21:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:21:06):**  like selling, sort of monetizing the biodiversity, monetizing the carbon, the water, the wild  
**[0:21:12-0:21:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:21:12):**  and cultivated spaces.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:21:14):**  I think is a really holistic and kind of ambitious way of trying to capture the full economy  
**[0:21:20-0:21:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:21:20):**  of place.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:21:21):**  And so I think for someone that's well down the journey, the Regen Network, it looked  
**[0:21:25-0:21:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:21:25):**  like a coon might've popped off, but I'll keep going.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:21:28):**  I think that there are things coming online.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:21:30):**  Soil Heroes is a great European outfit.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:21:33):**  Nourad and Gina and team who I think aspire to do something very similar.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:21:38):**  So it would support that.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:21:39):**  The other way is maybe a little less clear, but we're playing with it, is I think a big  
**[0:21:45-0:21:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:21:45):**  piece of us is what is that community of change and practice?  
**[0:21:49-0:21:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:21:49):**  How do we look to the wisdom keepers, the elders that are already sort of blazing the  
**[0:21:54-0:21:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:21:54):**  trail is such a colonial word, but that's what I mean.  
**[0:21:58-0:22:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:21:58):**  Sort of out there in the front that we can invite to reach back into the movement and  
**[0:22:05-0:22:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:22:05):**  help.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:22:06):**  For farmers that are already sort of fully organic and regenerative, we invite them as  
**[0:22:10-0:22:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:22:10):**  a part of our community to share with others and we can pay for that.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:22:14):**  And so I think there's a lot of ways to sort of monetarily reward those farmers.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:22:19):**  I think there's also ways to probably even more importantly, socially and culturally  
**[0:22:25-0:22:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:22:25):**  reward them.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:22:26):**  Many farmers that are on the front edge as a first mover or first kind of early adopter,  
**[0:22:32-0:22:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:22:32):**  they often feel really isolated because of their rural, their geographically isolated,  
**[0:22:37-0:22:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:22:37):**  their ideologically isolated.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:22:39):**  And so when they connect and find people in the movement, it's very, very rewarding to  
**[0:22:45-0:22:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:22:45):**  share those successes, those challenges.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:22:47):**  And so I think there's some social, financial and cultural ways to reward them that are  
**[0:22:53-0:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:22:53):**  built around community and possibly around monetization.  
**[0:22:56-0:22:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:22:56):**  There's probably a bunch more, but those are the ones that come to mind.  
**[0:22:59-0:23:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:22:59):**  Danica, does that answer your question?  
**[0:23:01-0:23:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:23:01):**  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:23:02):**  Thanks so much for sharing some ideas.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:23:06):**  Actual physical isolation is not such an issue since the Netherlands is so densely populated,  
**[0:23:10-0:23:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:23:10):**  the farmer lives like a little bit outside of a city.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:23:14):**  And it does come down to the fact that he does feel recognized, but that only goes so  
**[0:23:18-0:23:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:23:18):**  far and he needs that financial assistance.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:23:21):**  So it's interesting to also see that in the end, the money also matters to some extent  
**[0:23:27-0:23:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:23:27):**  if the farmer is struggling financially.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:23:29):**  But yeah, thank you so much for sharing some ideas.  
**[0:23:31-0:23:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:23:31):**  I'll let somebody else take the floor.  
**[0:23:33-0:23:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:23:33):**  Yeah, I would add one last thing, too, is, you know, for farmers like that, I feel like  
**[0:23:38-0:23:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:23:38):**  they're the best farmers to sort of pilot like the Soil Heroes platform, right?  
**[0:23:43-0:23:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:23:43):**  Like you're going to monetize like ecosystem value at the system scale.  
**[0:23:48-0:23:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:23:48):**  Like let's work with those farmers where we know what's possible.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:23:51):**  So I feel like that's one angle.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:23:52):**  I also feel like for farmers like that, that have that story and have everything in place,  
**[0:23:58-0:24:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:23:58):**  they're also the best to start with, like finding premiums in the market spot.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:24:02):**  You know what I mean?  
**[0:24:03-0:24:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:24:03):**  We work with farmers, you know, through Colorado where we're really we're pretty selective  
**[0:24:07-0:24:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:24:07):**  about like, OK, we want someone to grow dry beans for we have a buyer.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:24:13):**  Like we go to those farmers that we feel like need to be honored for their commitment and  
**[0:24:17-0:24:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:24:17):**  service and practice and stewardship.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:24:20):**  And we use those market opportunities to flow more money back to the farm whenever possible.  
**[0:24:25-0:24:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:24:25):**  So that market demand side, you know, which Brian was also talking about, I think is a  
**[0:24:31-0:24:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:24:31):**  really high potential.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:24:32):**  And farmers aren't often you know, there's so much it's so much to manage a farm ecosystem.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:24:38):**  It's very difficult to be an evangelical about your product in the marketplace.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:24:42):**  And they need help.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:24:44):**  And that's a lot of why we're building our markets program is to connect farmers to buyers  
**[0:24:48-0:24:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:24:48):**  and brands and brands to buyers and work on all those supply shed logistics, because that's  
**[0:24:54-0:25:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:24:54):**  outside of the farm gate and really difficult to manage time wise, know how wise, community  
**[0:25:00-0:25:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:25:00):**  wise and quite frankly, contracting wise.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:25:03):**  Right.  
**[0:25:04-0:25:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:25:04):**  Like it's hard to negotiate proper value for your crop.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:25:06):**  So we act as kind of a third party to do that.  
**[0:25:10-0:25:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:25:10):**  So those are some ways that the market thing can also be brought to bear for those lead  
**[0:25:14-0:25:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:25:14):**  farmers.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:25:15):**  Like you said, everybody needs a market.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:25:17):**  That's for sure.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:25:18):**  Yeah.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:25:19):**  And then moving to call Alan, how do you go about finding farmers?  
**[0:25:23-0:25:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:25:23):**  Is that like, do they find you or you find them?  
**[0:25:26-0:25:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:25:26):**  Or is it a mix?  
**[0:25:27-0:25:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:25:27):**  What has been like these four or like the let's say the pipeline that's happening now  
**[0:25:30-0:25:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:25:30):**  or the most successful ones, the ones you end up underwriting?  
**[0:25:33-0:25:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:25:33):**  How did you is there any general way if you find them or they all have a different story?  
**[0:25:39-0:25:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:25:39):**  Yeah, good question.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:25:41):**  So at first, nobody knew about us.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:25:43):**  So we had to really hit the pavement and just cold call tons of people like start building  
**[0:25:48-0:25:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:25:48):**  partnerships started to, you know, I would just get on the organic integrity list, which  
**[0:25:54-0:26:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:25:54):**  every USDA organic certified farmer has to publicly list location of their farm, crops  
**[0:26:01-0:26:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:26:01):**  they grow, phone number, email.  
**[0:26:03-0:26:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:26:03):**  And I just started calling people and I was just getting people on the line, floating  
**[0:26:07-0:26:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:26:07):**  the idea by them, seeing if this seemed reasonable or if we were out of our minds, mad thinking  
**[0:26:13-0:26:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:26:13):**  that transition financing was, you know, just too out there.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:26:16):**  A lot of people really liked the idea.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:26:18):**  So it started with the idea.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:26:20):**  Then it started, you know, we found a few farmers who said that they'd be interested  
**[0:26:24-0:26:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:26:24):**  in using our financing.  
**[0:26:26-0:26:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:26:26):**  Once we kind of had those few in and we really had those conversations, they started introducing  
**[0:26:30-0:26:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:26:30):**  us to a few of their friends, a few of their connections.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:26:34):**  From there, it's really just kind of been a spider web of us continuing to, you know,  
**[0:26:39-0:26:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:26:39):**  try to build authentic relationships with partners, with farmers we think would be a  
**[0:26:44-0:26:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:26:44):**  good fit and as well as a word of mouth.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:26:47):**  So I'd say word of mouth has so far been the biggest means of kind of our growth channel  
**[0:26:53-0:26:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:26:53):**  of getting out there into the world.  
**[0:26:55-0:27:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:26:55):**  Now that we've kind of built some good partnerships, have great investors, have our first loans  
**[0:27:01-0:27:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:27:01):**  out, it's real, it's happening.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:27:03):**  It's not just an idea now.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:27:05):**  So it's been easier to reach out and say, we have financing for your farmers who are  
**[0:27:09-0:27:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:27:09):**  transitioning to organic and, you know, we want to do that.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:27:12):**  We're not going to shy away like the community bank because finding those ways of finding  
**[0:27:17-0:27:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:27:17):**  farmers is really important because you can have, we could create the most useful product  
**[0:27:21-0:27:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:27:21):**  in the world, like the perfect transition financing mechanism.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:27:24):**  But if nobody knows about it, it's completely useless to actually integrating it into transitioning  
**[0:27:30-0:27:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:27:30):**  more acres.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:27:31):**  So I've been thinking in like these two main domains of create the best transition financing  
**[0:27:37-0:27:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:27:37):**  package that we can that is the most useful to farmers, testing revenue shares, standard  
**[0:27:43-0:27:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:27:43):**  APR, term lengths, you know, is it a line of credit, is it an operating loan, all of  
**[0:27:48-0:27:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:27:48):**  those nuances.  
**[0:27:49-0:27:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:27:49):**  And then at the same time, testing all of the different distribution channels, you know,  
**[0:27:53-0:27:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:27:53):**  ways of getting this product in front of farmers.  
**[0:27:56-0:28:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:27:56):**  So that's, you know, referral programs, word of mouth, sending little postcards to farmers.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:28:03):**  I sent 6,000 postcards out to the Midwest recently, cold calling people, just trying  
**[0:28:08-0:28:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:28:08):**  it all to see what will stick because ultimately our goal is to start moving billions of dollars  
**[0:28:14-0:28:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:28:14):**  into regenerative organic farmers' hands and to truly transform the food system.  
**[0:28:20-0:28:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:28:20):**  We're going to have to know what the best way of accessing the right types of farmers  
**[0:28:25-0:28:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:28:25):**  that would find this useful is.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:28:28):**  So we're testing that early on because, you know, we have ambitions of growing in 2022  
**[0:28:33-0:28:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:28:33):**  and 2023 into the second vehicle of sorts.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:28:37):**  Hopefully that answers your question.  
**[0:28:38-0:28:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:28:38):**  We definitely want to know more about that, but let's continue to move with some questions.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:28:42):**  Thais had one or actually two, and the first one is actually answered.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:28:45):**  How do you find the farmers?  
**[0:28:47-0:28:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:28:47):**  Get on there.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:28:48):**  How do you get them to lift their head if they have been 20 years with their heads down  
**[0:28:51-0:28:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:28:51):**  working on their soil?  
**[0:28:53-0:28:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:28:53):**  But the second one is interesting as well.  
**[0:28:55-0:28:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:28:55):**  How did the investors respond when in some cases you take the full operating loan of  
**[0:28:59-0:29:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:28:59):**  the farmer and not just the transition piece or they don't know yet?  
**[0:29:02-0:29:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:29:02):**  Maybe they find out on this call.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:29:04):**  Yeah, no good questions.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:29:07):**  So the first one, we haven't had to do much convincing.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:29:11):**  You know, it's been just really leading with, I think, wearing our heart on our sleeves  
**[0:29:15-0:29:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:29:15):**  and being super values first and just showing that this is the future we're trying to create.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:29:21):**  And that's just inspired people who this is the right fit for to come along side of us  
**[0:29:27-0:29:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:29:27):**  instead of trying to project what we think the future of their farm should look like.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:29:33):**  So like that farm that I read the quote from in Minnesota, when they saw it, they kind  
**[0:29:37-0:29:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:29:37):**  of knew they wanted it.  
**[0:29:38-0:29:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:29:38):**  And it was something that might've been kind of a cloud of maybe confusion as to why exactly  
**[0:29:44-0:29:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:29:44):**  they wanted to partner with us.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:29:46):**  But over the course of five, six, seven phone calls, it gets much easier to build trust  
**[0:29:51-0:29:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:29:51):**  to show that we are here for the long haul.  
**[0:29:54-0:29:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:29:54):**  We want to work with them until they retire.  
**[0:29:56-0:29:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:29:56):**  We want to work with their kids.  
**[0:29:57-0:29:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:29:57):**  I mean, this is a partnership.  
**[0:29:58-0:30:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:29:58):**  It's not just us giving them money.  
**[0:30:01-0:30:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:30:01):**  And then to the second part of the question, the investor part, how do they respond to  
**[0:30:06-0:30:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:30:06):**  the opportunity and the risk of taking over a full operating load or the full financing  
**[0:30:11-0:30:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:30:11):**  basically of a farm and not just a transition piece, which obviously was in the name, like  
**[0:30:14-0:30:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:30:14):**  we're going to transition actors to or acres to XYZ.  
**[0:30:18-0:30:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:30:18):**  Well though it is a little different than the initial intention, we're responding to  
**[0:30:23-0:30:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:30:23):**  the market in real time.  
**[0:30:25-0:30:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:30:25):**  Our initial intention of going out and funding only transitional ground, funding just those  
**[0:30:29-0:30:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:30:29):**  transitional acres is a good idea.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:30:32):**  I think if we could find the right mechanism of convincing community banks consistently  
**[0:30:37-0:30:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:30:37):**  to work with us, but we have found it very hard to have them share risk.  
**[0:30:43-0:30:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:30:43):**  So whether that's with a document that we've been creating in partnership with Iroquois  
**[0:30:48-0:30:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:30:48):**  Valley Farms called the inter creditor agreement, which is sharing collateral on a pro rata  
**[0:30:53-0:30:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:30:53):**  basis based on outstanding balance on the loan, which let's say we fund 200,000 and  
**[0:30:59-0:31:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:30:59):**  the local bank funds 800,000 on a million dollar loan, we would have rights to 20% of  
**[0:31:04-0:31:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:31:04):**  the collateral.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:31:05):**  Sounds totally reasonable.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:31:07):**  Sounds like we're sharing risk there.  
**[0:31:09-0:31:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:31:09):**  How many banks are comfortable doing that it seems even after numerous conversations  
**[0:31:13-0:31:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:31:13):**  and trying to find the right mechanisms of just truly partnering with these farmers to  
**[0:31:18-0:31:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:31:18):**  help them transition.  
**[0:31:19-0:31:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:31:19):**  So instead of us basically having 10, 20 conversations to convince the banker, their board, their  
**[0:31:27-0:31:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:31:27):**  CEO, all of the folks that need to say yes, go ahead for that to happen.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:31:32):**  It's much easier and much less friction for the farmer and for us to just finance all  
**[0:31:38-0:31:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:31:38):**  their organic acres, their transitional acres, and then conventional acres that are soon  
**[0:31:42-0:31:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:31:42):**  committed to beginning transition.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:31:45):**  Because at the end of the day, all of the farmers we're working with are committed to  
**[0:31:48-0:31:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:31:48):**  going 100% organic with soil health in mind.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:31:52):**  So that reduces the risk because then we're able to actually properly collateralize.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:31:57):**  We don't have to deal with other parties who could have, you know, aren't understanding  
**[0:32:01-0:32:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:32:01):**  exactly what we're shooting for here and how we're trying to help these farmers.  
**[0:32:05-0:32:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:32:05):**  And it just kind of cleans up the relationship management.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:32:09):**  But we are still pursuing opportunities of finding the right ways to partner with other  
**[0:32:14-0:32:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:32:14):**  banks.  
**[0:32:15-0:32:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:32:15):**  We just haven't been able to do it yet.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:32:17):**  And we probably just haven't found the right bank, haven't found the right mechanism.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:32:20):**  Does it reduce the amount of farmers you're going to be working with?  
**[0:32:23-0:32:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:32:23):**  Like from the plan to does it reduce the amount of the number of farmers you can be working  
**[0:32:28-0:32:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:32:28):**  with with the 10 million basically?  
**[0:32:30-0:32:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:32:30):**  Potentially, you know, initially we came out saying we were going to fund 20 to 25 farmers.  
**[0:32:35-0:32:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:32:35):**  It's probably looking like more like the 15 to 20 type range.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:32:40):**  But it doesn't change a whole bunch because what assumption we had made was that farmers  
**[0:32:45-0:32:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:32:45):**  would only be servicing, let's say, 20 to 30% on the loan that we were outlaying during  
**[0:32:51-0:32:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:32:51):**  transition to fund their loss during those transitional years.  
**[0:32:55-0:33:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:32:55):**  Many of these farms are actually able to service significantly more on the loan than we had  
**[0:33:00-0:33:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:33:00):**  anticipated.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:33:01):**  There are other farms that are going to pass back in full every year from year one.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:33:05):**  Like we just gave out a loan to two of those farmers.  
**[0:33:08-0:33:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:33:08):**  We'll pay back the note in full this year and then we'll continue financing them because  
**[0:33:13-0:33:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:33:13):**  we've made a commitment to them for at least the next five years.  
**[0:33:16-0:33:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:33:16):**  And then hopefully, you know, we have the second structure set up as to where we can  
**[0:33:20-0:33:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:33:20):**  make a longer term commitment into the future.  
**[0:33:23-0:33:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:33:23):**  Introduce the amount of farmers, but at the same time, the impact and the hectares.  
**[0:33:29-0:33:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:33:29):**  And we're going to be able to revolve that capital that comes in the first couple of  
**[0:33:33-0:33:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:33:33):**  years back into financing.  
**[0:33:34-0:33:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:33:34):**  So we've got in a way more capital to work with, probably more acres to touch.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:33:39):**  Maybe the numbers of farmers goes down because it's a little more capital intensive.  
**[0:33:43-0:33:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:33:43):**  But yeah, and I'd say it also reduces the risk because we're able to put more capital,  
**[0:33:49-0:33:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:33:49):**  we're able to revolve more capital consistently.  
**[0:33:51-0:33:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:33:51):**  And then there's also more touch points with the farmer.  
**[0:33:56-0:34:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:33:56):**  They're constantly receiving most of the loan back and then redistributing it again into  
**[0:34:01-0:34:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:34:01):**  the next season for them to continue funding, you know, their production costs.  
**[0:34:05-0:34:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:34:05):**  So it also just more touch points, more consistency.  
**[0:34:09-0:34:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:34:09):**  It'll just be a more active relationship of us being engaged, understanding what's happening  
**[0:34:13-0:34:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:34:13):**  on the farm instead of just touching those transitional acres, which, you know, would  
**[0:34:18-0:34:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:34:18):**  be a smaller portion of their operation.  
**[0:34:20-0:34:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:34:20):**  Now it's more of a it's a deeper partnership at the whole farm level as well.  
**[0:34:24-0:34:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:34:24):**  So that's been really exciting for many farmers is I mean, they're saying, we want to work  
**[0:34:29-0:34:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:34:29):**  with you for the next 20 years.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:34:31):**  And that's great.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:34:32):**  The other thing it does is it opens up their entire farm for us to think about what to  
**[0:34:37-0:34:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:34:37):**  sell into the marketplace.  
**[0:34:38-0:34:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:34:38):**  You know, if you're just thinking about marketing transitional crops, it's usually not the time  
**[0:34:43-0:34:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:34:43):**  to try to be squeezing economics out of your farm.  
**[0:34:46-0:34:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:34:46):**  It's a time to reinvest.  
**[0:34:47-0:34:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:34:47):**  And so we can look to those organic acres and say, hey, what are you doing every year?  
**[0:34:51-0:34:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:34:51):**  What are you aspiring to?  
**[0:34:53-0:34:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:34:53):**  What's the best way to work on a more full rotation?  
**[0:34:55-0:34:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:34:55):**  Because a lot of transition years in the Midwest is, you know, alfalfa with the nearest crop  
**[0:34:59-0:35:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:34:59):**  of oats.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:35:00):**  That's probably the best way to go if you've got an alfalfa market.  
**[0:35:03-0:35:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:35:03):**  And so it limits our creativity to really regenerate the land, which is diversity first.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:35:10):**  I mean, diversity and perenniality are the big perspectives and ways of regenerating.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:35:15):**  And we do that more effectively by having access to the entire farm ecosystem.  
**[0:35:20-0:35:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:35:20):**  So, you know, what felt like a hurdle has now become the massive opportunity that we're  
**[0:35:24-0:35:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:35:24):**  really excited about.  
**[0:35:25-0:35:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:35:25):**  And you mentioned a couple of times in the 20 years and second vehicle, etc.  
**[0:35:29-0:35:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:35:29):**  What is in the thoughts there, if you want and are able to share?  
**[0:35:33-0:35:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:35:33):**  Yeah, we're first to get money back into the bank from our investments.  
**[0:35:39-0:35:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:35:39):**  So it is like just to calibrate the pace.  
**[0:35:42-0:35:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:35:42):**  We're still living, learning and deploying.  
**[0:35:44-0:35:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:35:44):**  But yeah, I don't know, maybe we can speak to a little bit.  
**[0:35:47-0:35:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:35:47):**  It's sort of just horizon gazing, but we realize the need, right?  
**[0:35:51-0:35:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:35:51):**  Like a fund that might not be the best structure for long term partnerships.  
**[0:35:55-0:35:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:35:55):**  And so I don't know, maybe you can speak at a high level around what we're thinking.  
**[0:35:58-0:36:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:35:58):**  But yeah, I'll try to keep it really short because we could talk about this for an hour.  
**[0:36:03-0:36:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:36:03):**  So there are various vehicles that we're exploring because we're realizing the inherent limitations  
**[0:36:10-0:36:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:36:10):**  of a 10 year fund life, which is pretty this is kind of, you know, cookie cutter standard,  
**[0:36:15-0:36:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:36:15):**  you know, easier to raise money around and, you know, say we'll have your money back by  
**[0:36:18-0:36:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:36:18):**  this time period.  
**[0:36:20-0:36:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:36:20):**  That doesn't match, like the length of time that we're able to commit to alone doesn't  
**[0:36:25-0:36:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:36:25):**  match, you know, the underlying asset being a farm which takes generations and is multi  
**[0:36:31-0:36:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:36:31):**  decadal and, you know, is going to be there for hundreds of years.  
**[0:36:35-0:36:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:36:35):**  So we are intending to create something that's much longer term, so we can make a longer  
**[0:36:39-0:36:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:36:39):**  term commitment to our farmers, make a 10, 15, 20 year commitment to our farmers, and  
**[0:36:46-0:36:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:36:46):**  recycle capital more consistently without worrying about having to hold on to it.  
**[0:36:50-0:36:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:36:50):**  And let's say you're four, five and six to make distributions to our investors versus  
**[0:36:55-0:37:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:36:55):**  continuing to kind of retain those really strong relationships and farmers we've been  
**[0:37:00-0:37:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:37:00):**  able to bring in.  
**[0:37:01-0:37:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:37:01):**  So an Evergreen Fund might be a solution to that.  
**[0:37:05-0:37:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:37:05):**  Maybe it's a CDFI.  
**[0:37:07-0:37:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:37:07):**  We've also been kicking that idea around to access really low cost capital from the US  
**[0:37:12-0:37:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:37:12):**  government, which just gives money out these days.  
**[0:37:15-0:37:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:37:15):**  Or maybe it's some sort of another mechanism where we're kind of like a platform or a conduit  
**[0:37:20-0:37:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:37:20):**  for connecting, let's say banking partners and individual investors to farmers that are,  
**[0:37:26-0:37:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:37:26):**  you know, mad certified or that we've done underwriting on and due diligence, and then  
**[0:37:31-0:37:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:37:31):**  we've brought onto the platform and then we're just kind of the connecting point and we take  
**[0:37:35-0:37:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:37:35):**  some sort of a VIG on the top.  
**[0:37:37-0:37:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:37:37):**  Those are the leading ideas.  
**[0:37:39-0:37:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:37:39):**  It might be a bank.  
**[0:37:40-0:37:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:37:40):**  That's another idea we're throwing around, but the amount of regulation and permitting  
**[0:37:44-0:37:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:37:44):**  and the difficulty of actually getting certified in the US is pretty burdensome.  
**[0:37:49-0:37:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:37:49):**  So we're trying to think through how to balance the relationships that we hold with our farmers,  
**[0:37:54-0:37:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:37:54):**  which is really kind of our remote and thing that is non-displacable with using, you know,  
**[0:37:59-0:38:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:37:59):**  modern technology, ability to get capital in the hands of farmers who need it.  
**[0:38:04-0:38:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:38:04):**  And then as well as align the length of capital to the values and virtues of these farmers  
**[0:38:10-0:38:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:38:10):**  want to embody in the way that they manage their farms.  
**[0:38:13-0:38:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:38:13):**  So there's these multiple factors that are all kind of dynamically competing for one  
**[0:38:17-0:38:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:38:17):**  another.  
**[0:38:18-0:38:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:38:18):**  And we are pretty agnostic as to how that turns out.  
**[0:38:22-0:38:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:38:22):**  Right now we're just in full bore listening mode to investors and to farmers to see what  
**[0:38:28-0:38:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:38:28):**  is the most useful and practical to creating enough inertia and getting this flywheel spinning  
**[0:38:34-0:38:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:38:34):**  to where we can help the market grow.  
**[0:38:36-0:38:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:38:36):**  We can help reduce the amount of friction and every farmer who wants to transition to  
**[0:38:41-0:38:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:38:41):**  regenerative organic ag has the financing they need, the markets they need and the technical  
**[0:38:45-0:38:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:38:45):**  assistance they need to do so.  
**[0:38:48-0:38:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:38:48):**  I think it's a topic we'll come back to over the next couple of years and see how it develops.  
**[0:38:53-0:38:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:38:53):**  Let's see as we're slowly getting closer to the top of the hour, if we can get through  
**[0:38:56-0:38:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:38:56):**  a few more questions.  
**[0:38:57-0:39:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:38:57):**  Willy Webb asked one or actually two on the buyer side, which we sort of covered, but  
**[0:39:02-0:39:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:39:02):**  then also something like how do the buyer contracts and off-take agreements fit in with  
**[0:39:06-0:39:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:39:06):**  crop insurance and other ways of reducing risk, guaranteeing income and offering a safety  
**[0:39:11-0:39:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:39:11):**  net?  
**[0:39:12-0:39:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:39:12):**  Is that something you have been exploring, touching upon?  
**[0:39:16-0:39:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:39:16):**  Just a tip of discussing, you know, the crop insurance thing is tough.  
**[0:39:20-0:39:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:39:20):**  We know if you're growing corn and beans, you need to really need crop insurance.  
**[0:39:23-0:39:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:39:23):**  Price loss protection is kind of the American version of that.  
**[0:39:27-0:39:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:39:27):**  We encourage whole farm protection, but that also has its kind of hitches.  
**[0:39:32-0:39:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:39:32):**  And then once you get above growing six or seven things, usually you don't need insurance  
**[0:39:37-0:39:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:39:37):**  from a statistical perspective.  
**[0:39:39-0:39:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:39:39):**  Usually there's enough on-farm resilience that you actually don't need to purchase insurance.  
**[0:39:44-0:39:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:39:44):**  So right now we're kind of in this in-between where in some farms we're really insurance  
**[0:39:48-0:39:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:39:48):**  focused.  
**[0:39:49-0:39:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:39:49):**  They might be sort of still in the corn, bean, alfalfa system and taking their first steps  
**[0:39:53-0:39:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:39:53):**  into decommodifying the specialty crop.  
**[0:39:56-0:40:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:39:56):**  And so we'll do that in a very calibrated, low acreage way.  
**[0:40:00-0:40:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:40:00):**  The way we de-risk that is by creating what we call a mutually beneficial contract where  
**[0:40:04-0:40:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:40:04):**  we have the buyer put money down, you know, with skin in the game on their commitment.  
**[0:40:09-0:40:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:40:09):**  So there's not a total loss, but we do have active gods in place for the farmer so that  
**[0:40:14-0:40:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:40:14):**  if they can't deliver, then that's okay as well.  
**[0:40:16-0:40:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:40:16):**  So we've been playing around with that quite a bit.  
**[0:40:19-0:40:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:40:19):**  Honestly, we're just growing into this space and I think we're going to be learning a ton  
**[0:40:23-0:40:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:40:23):**  over the next year and we'll be happy to report back on our learnings.  
**[0:40:27-0:40:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:40:27):**  But we're hiring two people right now to actually really tackle this area in full and deal with  
**[0:40:32-0:40:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:40:32):**  all these issues.  
**[0:40:33-0:40:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:40:33):**  And how do you find the buyers?  
**[0:40:35-0:40:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:40:35):**  Question from Willy as well.  
**[0:40:36-0:40:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:40:36):**  Did he find you?  
**[0:40:37-0:40:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:40:37):**  Is it what's on the buyer side of this market?  
**[0:40:41-0:40:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:40:41):**  Yeah, again, just kind of coming in, it sort of fits and starts and nothing that organized.  
**[0:40:46-0:40:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:40:46):**  I mean, I think, you know, the work of Terragenesis, the work of Regen, the work of Howgood, those  
**[0:40:52-0:40:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:40:52):**  are all sort of comrades in the movement that I deeply respect.  
**[0:40:55-0:41:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:40:55):**  And they've been, you know, I've been, I don't know, underneath their wing in many ways,  
**[0:41:00-0:41:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:41:00):**  sort of getting to know brands and buyers.  
**[0:41:03-0:41:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:41:03):**  And we've done our own work as well.  
**[0:41:05-0:41:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:41:05):**  Boulder here is kind of the epicenter of the natural food movement in the world.  
**[0:41:08-0:41:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:41:08):**  Well, I don't know if the world, but in USA.  
**[0:41:11-0:41:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:41:11):**  And so there are a lot of mission aligned brands here.  
**[0:41:15-0:41:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:41:15):**  Not a lot of big buyers.  
**[0:41:16-0:41:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:41:16):**  That's the problem.  
**[0:41:17-0:41:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:41:17):**  You can't sort of sell a bag of beans for a good price to brands and also to institutional  
**[0:41:22-0:41:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:41:22):**  procurement.  
**[0:41:23-0:41:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:41:23):**  But to get that long contract where you're selling 250,000 bushels of something, you  
**[0:41:28-0:41:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:41:28):**  know, is kind of new territory for us.  
**[0:41:29-0:41:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:41:29):**  We're going to need to figure that out because that's what the land base that we're working  
**[0:41:33-0:41:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:41:33):**  with is going to need to have as a market.  
**[0:41:36-0:41:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:41:36):**  And so we're just at the beginning.  
**[0:41:37-0:41:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:41:37):**  I know that there's a lot of energy within general mills and Kellogg's and pipeline foods,  
**[0:41:42-0:41:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:41:42):**  nature's path, cliff bar, everyone from those to Patagonia provisions has ambition to push  
**[0:41:48-0:41:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:41:48):**  in this direction.  
**[0:41:50-0:41:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:41:50):**  And right now, as I said, there's an enormous amount of friction between, you know, those  
**[0:41:55-0:41:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:41:55):**  brands and the farmers that are actually growing.  
**[0:41:57-0:42:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:41:57):**  And that's where we really feel like we can step in and help in a variety of ways.  
**[0:42:01-0:42:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:42:01):**  So I think as you track our progress, Coon, we're on the podcast.  
**[0:42:05-0:42:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:42:05):**  Let's come back to these issues and kind of track our progress.  
**[0:42:07-0:42:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:42:07):**  Be happy to share with your community what's going on.  
**[0:42:11-0:42:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:42:11):**  And for the next one, actually, we're shifting gears a bit to the investor side.  
**[0:42:15-0:42:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:42:15):**  How did you find investors?  
**[0:42:17-0:42:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:42:17):**  And it connected to your first question, like how accessible was or is this fund?  
**[0:42:22-0:42:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:42:22):**  Is there a lot of regulation around it in the US to offer things like this?  
**[0:42:25-0:42:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:42:25):**  This comes from Daniela Denis, who is operating in the Netherlands.  
**[0:42:29-0:42:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:42:29):**  How tricky was that?  
**[0:42:31-0:42:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:42:31):**  Or is that actually?  
**[0:42:32-0:42:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:42:32):**  Just Silverstrand.  
**[0:42:33-0:42:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:42:33):**  I mean, I feel like a lot.  
**[0:42:34-0:42:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:42:34):**  I mean, we have a big shout out to Silverstrand.  
**[0:42:37-0:42:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:42:37):**  I mean, Silverstrand was our anchor investor.  
**[0:42:40-0:42:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:42:40):**  Kelvin and his team, Patty and Chen, now Rachel, they just in the best of ways put us through  
**[0:42:45-0:42:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:42:45):**  the ringer.  
**[0:42:46-0:42:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:42:46):**  You know, we're first time fund managers.  
**[0:42:48-0:42:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:42:48):**  And you know, their due diligence on us really improved our game.  
**[0:42:53-0:42:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:42:53):**  And Homecoming Capital and Tin Shed out of Patagonia also came underneath their wing  
**[0:42:58-0:43:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:42:58):**  to support as lead investors.  
**[0:43:01-0:43:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:43:01):**  And just a huge shout out to them for living and learning with us over the two years.  
**[0:43:07-0:43:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:43:07):**  And I think Brandon can speak a lot more to how that kind of initial work led to a whole  
**[0:43:11-0:43:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:43:11):**  community of investors coming together.  
**[0:43:13-0:43:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:43:13):**  Yeah, I mean, initially meeting them was total happenstance.  
**[0:43:17-0:43:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:43:17):**  Just happened to have an email from Kelvin, had met him in person.  
**[0:43:20-0:43:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:43:20):**  We really got along.  
**[0:43:22-0:43:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:43:22):**  And as he was growing his team, you know, we were starting the fund and we were kind  
**[0:43:27-0:43:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:43:27):**  of put through like Phil was saying, like, you know, it felt like we were training for  
**[0:43:31-0:43:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:43:31):**  like fund Olympics or something.  
**[0:43:33-0:43:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:43:33):**  I mean, we were going for, you know, first time and they had really helped us dial in  
**[0:43:37-0:43:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:43:37):**  all the documents, PPM models, and really just started, they were pushing in the right  
**[0:43:43-0:43:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:43:43):**  spots to have us question our assumptions and then put specifics and rigor behind them  
**[0:43:48-0:43:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:43:48):**  to make sure that they were, you know, validated in some way.  
**[0:43:51-0:43:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:43:51):**  So that really prepped us to have a, what I think was a pretty good offering when we  
**[0:43:56-0:43:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:43:56):**  went to market to investors.  
**[0:43:58-0:44:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:43:58):**  It was during that time period as we were creating that with Silverstrand by our side,  
**[0:44:04-0:44:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:44:04):**  it was just slowly, we had some investors reaching out every time they reached out at  
**[0:44:08-0:44:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:44:08):**  the beginning, I would ask, you know, do you have one other person in your network that  
**[0:44:12-0:44:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:44:12):**  you'd be willing to introduce me to?  
**[0:44:15-0:44:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:44:15):**  And then we slowly just started propagating just through word of mouth.  
**[0:44:18-0:44:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:44:18):**  And I think your podcast back in mid 2019 as we were kicking off the idea was a incredible  
**[0:44:24-0:44:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:44:24):**  catalyst for the entire effort because we did not know any investors.  
**[0:44:29-0:44:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:44:29):**  You know, we knew a few, but we didn't know the couple hundred that we know now, even  
**[0:44:33-0:44:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:44:33):**  a year and a half, two years ago.  
**[0:44:35-0:44:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:44:35):**  So it's a lot of just community development and just really trying to bridge those gaps  
**[0:44:41-0:44:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:44:41):**  and talk with people.  
**[0:44:43-0:44:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:44:43):**  And this investment, Daniel, this is high, but this is not super accessible yet in terms  
**[0:44:50-0:44:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:44:50):**  of like it is just for high net worth individuals, accredited investors in the US, around the  
**[0:44:55-0:44:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:44:55):**  world, but predominantly.  
**[0:44:56-0:45:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:44:56):**  Unfortunately, yeah, we actually, we're two tiers above accredited investor.  
**[0:45:00-0:45:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:45:00):**  You have to be a qualified purchaser.  
**[0:45:02-0:45:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:45:02):**  You have to have at least 5 million in net liquid assets if you're an individual, you  
**[0:45:06-0:45:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:45:06):**  know, outside of your home.  
**[0:45:08-0:45:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:45:08):**  And if you're a fund, at least 25 million.  
**[0:45:10-0:45:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:45:10):**  And if you're a foundation, at least 5 million.  
**[0:45:12-0:45:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:45:12):**  That was to make some of the SEC regulations a little less burdensome, but yeah, it's not  
**[0:45:18-0:45:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:45:18):**  accessible yet.  
**[0:45:19-0:45:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:45:19):**  In the second vehicle, we hope to integrate some form of democratizing access.  
**[0:45:23-0:45:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:45:23):**  So folks who are not accredited will be able to access the fund.  
**[0:45:28-0:45:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:45:28):**  That was just another layer of complexity in a first fundraise that would have been  
**[0:45:32-0:45:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:45:32):**  over the top for us right now, but it is the ambition to allow anybody to participate.  
**[0:45:36-0:45:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:45:36):**  Yeah, that would be extremely interesting I think to Daniel as well.  
**[0:45:41-0:45:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:45:41):**  We're not going to get through all the questions, but I'm picking just one from Rosalie because  
**[0:45:44-0:45:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:45:44):**  I think it could go, I mean, could go down a rabbit hole.  
**[0:45:47-0:45:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:45:47):**  But what are your thoughts on the exhausting of the regen movement?  
**[0:45:52-0:45:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:45:52):**  I have a feeling we're just getting started, but it may be my bubble.  
**[0:45:55-0:45:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:45:55):**  You mean just sort of...  
**[0:45:56-0:45:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:45:56):**  But what do you mean, Rosalie?  
**[0:45:57-0:46:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:45:57):**  In general, the hype cycle we're going up and then we fall off the cliff again?  
**[0:46:01-0:46:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:46:01):**  Or what are your thoughts behind that question?  
**[0:46:05-0:46:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:46:05):**  Hi.  
**[0:46:06-0:46:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:46:06):**  Well, I'm thinking that you were just a little while ago talking about the big food companies  
**[0:46:14-0:46:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:46:14):**  and I'm thinking about like they use the word regen to get the good feeling for everyone.  
**[0:46:25-0:46:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:46:25):**  Yeah.  
**[0:46:26-0:46:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:46:26):**  Yeah.  
**[0:46:27-0:46:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:46:27):**  Yeah.  
**[0:46:28-0:46:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:46:28):**  They set their own standards and live by them.  
**[0:46:29-0:46:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:46:29):**  And no, that is, I mean, yeah, exhausting is one word to describe it.  
**[0:46:35-0:46:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:46:35):**  And I think regenerative ag, I have two kind of competing feelings about it.  
**[0:46:41-0:46:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:46:41):**  Like I think in one light, regenerative ag in its truest essence is about aspiring to  
**[0:46:47-0:46:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:46:47):**  listen deeply to what the land wants us to be and asking the question of what does the  
**[0:46:54-0:47:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:46:54):**  indigeneity of this place require of us as humanity to aspire to?  
**[0:47:00-0:47:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:47:00):**  Very place-based understanding of the evolutionary and ecological expression of every unique  
**[0:47:06-0:47:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:47:06):**  place on earth.  
**[0:47:07-0:47:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:47:07):**  And that aspiration is so far away from what is that it's sometimes hard to even feel like  
**[0:47:13-0:47:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:47:13):**  we're moving the needle toward it.  
**[0:47:15-0:47:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:47:15):**  At the same time, I feel like regeneration is a process and not a destination.  
**[0:47:21-0:47:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:47:21):**  And so any step toward healing our relationship to ourselves, to others, to any living thing  
**[0:47:28-0:47:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:47:28):**  and non-living thing is also a regenerative effort.  
**[0:47:31-0:47:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:47:31):**  And so I don't begrudge anyone in that process.  
**[0:47:35-0:47:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:47:35):**  And if that's a regenerative act, then it's regenerative.  
**[0:47:38-0:47:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:47:38):**  And so I sort of see regeneration as a word or a concept much bigger than any single paragraph,  
**[0:47:44-0:47:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:47:44):**  book or sentence or idea can hold.  
**[0:47:47-0:47:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:47:47):**  And the word is being exhausted and cheapened, but I think that it's a word that best describes  
**[0:47:55-0:48:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:47:55):**  where we are and the need to reimagine our relationship to earth and others.  
**[0:48:01-0:48:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:48:01):**  And so we're holding tenaciously onto it.  
**[0:48:05-0:48:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:48:05):**  And there's some great other people in the world that are also holding fiercely into  
**[0:48:08-0:48:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:48:08):**  it, have actually been at this work much longer than I.  
**[0:48:11-0:48:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:48:11):**  I feel like as being fully cognizant of being a white male in Colorado in the front range,  
**[0:48:18-0:48:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:48:18):**  not too many generations in on colonializing, we're a relic of that and in many ways perpetuating  
**[0:48:25-0:48:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:48:25):**  it.  
**[0:48:26-0:48:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:48:26):**  And so I feel like for me, as much as I aspire to what it is, I feel like I'm really entering  
**[0:48:30-0:48:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:48:30):**  every day with a beginner's mind and probably know as little as anyone else about it.  
**[0:48:37-0:48:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:48:37):**  So I don't know, I think humility is kind of required the whole process.  
**[0:48:42-0:48:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:48:42):**  So I don't know, we have kind of a non-judgment thing here at Madag.  
**[0:48:46-0:48:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:48:46):**  That's kind of a cheap way of saying it, but we really try to welcome all to the movement,  
**[0:48:52-0:48:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:48:52):**  but we end up being pretty specific about who we work with.  
**[0:48:55-0:48:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:48:55):**  Yeah, sounds good.  
**[0:48:57-0:49:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:48:57):**  But I think at least for me, my fear is that the big food companies will use it to look  
**[0:49:07-0:49:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:49:07):**  good for us all.  
**[0:49:09-0:49:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:49:09):**  One, this word is getting more and more used and familiar to the general public.  
**[0:49:20-0:49:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:49:20):**  And that's kind of like, we're working with so and so many farmers and we have so and  
**[0:49:28-0:49:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:49:28):**  so many acres and we're doing regenerative, but are they really?  
**[0:49:34-0:49:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:49:34):**  I hear you.  
**[0:49:36-0:49:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:49:36):**  I hear you.  
**[0:49:37-0:49:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:49:37):**  Yeah.  
**[0:49:38-0:49:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:49:38):**  I mean, regenerative ag has become kind of boiled in America broad acre sense, commodity  
**[0:49:43-0:49:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:49:43):**  sense.  
**[0:49:44-0:49:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:49:44):**  It's sort of like the five principles of soil health, that the National Resource Conservation  
**[0:49:48-0:49:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:49:48):**  Service quote created, which has been popularized by Gabe Brown, nothing against any of them,  
**[0:49:54-0:49:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:49:54):**  but that's sort of what it's boiled down to.  
**[0:49:56-0:50:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:49:56):**  And that is like just a piece of the regenerative paradigm.  
**[0:50:03-0:50:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:50:03):**  So anyway, you're right.  
**[0:50:06-0:50:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:50:06):**  Rosalie, you're totally spot on.  
**[0:50:07-0:50:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:50:07):**  And let's hold to that word in paradigm tenaciously and hopefully call ourselves and everyone  
**[0:50:13-0:50:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:50:13):**  up to a more emergent way of being.  
**[0:50:17-0:50:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:50:17):**  I think we can.  
**[0:50:19-0:50:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:50:19):**  I think it's great what you're doing.  
**[0:50:21-0:50:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:50:21):**  I'm looking forward to doing something similar in Sweden and Europe.  
**[0:50:26-0:50:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:50:26):**  Excellent.  
**[0:50:27-0:50:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:50:27):**  Thank you all so much.  
**[0:50:28-0:50:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:50:28):**  I want to make sure we stop on top of the hour more or less.  
**[0:50:32-0:50:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:50:32):**  Thank you so much for your time, calling in your questions, whatever time zone we're in.  
**[0:50:37-0:50:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:50:37):**  And thank you so much for listening to the podcast, reaching out to me.  
**[0:50:41-0:50:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:50:41):**  I'm sorry if I'm not always responding as fast as we used to, but we're growing fast  
**[0:50:46-0:50:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:50:46):**  and that's amazing to have.  
**[0:50:47-0:50:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:50:47):**  But it's also an issue sometimes.  
**[0:50:49-0:50:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:50:49):**  We'll definitely keep sharing content like this, webinars like this to try to connect  
**[0:50:54-0:50:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:50:54):**  the community around the podcast more and more.  
**[0:50:56-0:50:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:50:56):**  We have a lot of plans and you'll be hearing from us.  
**[0:50:59-0:51:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:50:59):**  But first of all, I want to thank Phil and Brandon for taking the time to share in a  
**[0:51:03-0:51:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:51:03):**  very, very busy time.  
**[0:51:05-0:51:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:51:05):**  So thank you so much.

**[0:53:20-0:53:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:53:20):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:53:22-0:53:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:53:22):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you and I'm very aware

**[0:53:42-0:53:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:53:42):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  
**[0:53:49-0:53:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:53:49):**  so you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:53:50-0:53:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:53:50):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:53:55-0:54:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:53:55):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:54:01-0:54:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:54:01):**  invest in, what kind of co investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[0:54:06-0:54:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:54:06):**  if you're a soy builder.  
**[0:54:07-0:54:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:54:07):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:54:12-0:54:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:54:12):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:54:16-0:54:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:54:16):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:54:21-0:54:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:54:21):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:54:22-0:54:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:54:22):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:54:24-0:54:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:54:24):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:54:26-0:54:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:54:26):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:54:30-0:54:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:54:30):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:54:32-0:54:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:54:32):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.  
**[0:54:37-0:54:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/qa-webinar-brandon-phil/#t=0:54:37):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking.

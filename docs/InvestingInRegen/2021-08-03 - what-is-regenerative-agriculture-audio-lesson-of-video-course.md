## What is regenerative agriculture - Audio Lesson of Video Course  
**[0:00:00-0:00:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:00:00):**  Up next is an audio extract of one of the lessons of our video course,  
**[0:00:03-0:00:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:00:03):**  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, specifically on what is regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:00:08-0:00:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:00:08):**  Probably the question I get the most after can we actually make returns while investing in  
**[0:00:13-0:00:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:00:13):**  regenerative food, which is for another lesson.  
**[0:00:16-0:00:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:00:16):**  If you want to know more, find the link to the full video course in the description below,  
**[0:00:20-0:00:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:00:20):**  or go to investinginregenerativeagriculture.com.com.  
**[0:00:24-0:00:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:00:24):**  Enjoy.  
**[0:00:26-0:00:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:00:26):**  Welcome to the second lesson of the online course, investing in regenerative  
**[0:00:29-0:00:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:00:29):**  agriculture and food, how to put your money to work in regenerating soils and  
**[0:00:33-0:00:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:00:33):**  ecosystems at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  
**[0:00:38-0:00:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:00:38):**  Today, we look into what is regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:00:42-0:00:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:00:42):**  Probably the question I get most when I'm talking to people, what is actually regenerative  
**[0:00:47-0:00:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:00:47):**  agriculture and food?  
**[0:00:48-0:00:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:00:48):**  Don't worry, we're going to not go too fast.  
**[0:00:51-0:00:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:00:51):**  We're going to scratch the surface.  
**[0:00:52-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:00:52):**  I'm going to give you a few mental frameworks to think about this, and I hope this helps.  
**[0:00:58-0:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:00:58):**  And then at the end, I will give you a number of articles to read, a number of websites, a  
**[0:01:03-0:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:01:03):**  number of books to really dive deeper into this.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:01:06):**  So I will put that all in the slides of this.  
**[0:01:09-0:01:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:01:09):**  This presentation will turn into a slide and you can download it and find all the links  
**[0:01:13-0:01:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:01:13):**  also below.  
**[0:01:15-0:01:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:01:15):**  First, a few housekeeping rules of housekeeping notes.  
**[0:01:19-0:01:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:01:19):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[0:01:21-0:01:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:01:21):**  I've been following this space of regenerative agriculture and food since 2011, and I've been  
**[0:01:26-0:01:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:01:26):**  recording a podcast on the same subject, so how to invest in regenerative agriculture  
**[0:01:32-0:01:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:01:32):**  since 2016.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:01:34):**  And this got us to over 90 interviews with more than 100 hours of interviews where we  
**[0:01:40-0:01:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:01:40):**  asked the experts in the field, the investors, the farmers, the scientists how to put money  
**[0:01:44-0:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:01:44):**  to work and get it back.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:01:46):**  And we decided it was time to start sharing what we've learned, sharing it with the soil  
**[0:01:51-0:01:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:01:51):**  builders in the field, the people that are building soil, the entrepreneurial farmers,  
**[0:01:56-0:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:01:56):**  the ag tech companies, the fund managers, the investment vehicle builders, the farm  
**[0:02:03-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:02:03):**  to gut food companies, everybody that's thinking and working beyond their own farm gate and  
**[0:02:09-0:02:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:02:09):**  with more than their own money.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:02:10):**  And to the investors, the people working in family offices that are investing their own  
**[0:02:13-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:02:13):**  money, people working in foundations, insurance companies, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:02:19):**  We want to be the bridge between those two groups as the soil builders have to or should  
**[0:02:23-0:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:02:23):**  learn, I think, more about finance and investors should learn a lot more about soil.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:02:28):**  Is this course free?  
**[0:02:30-0:02:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:02:30):**  No, we're using a system called Pay What You Think It's Worth, inspired by the gift  
**[0:02:35-0:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:02:35):**  economy of Charles Eisenstein and how Frederick Laloux, the writer of the book Reinventing  
**[0:02:39-0:02:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:02:39):**  Organizations, is charging for his book.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:02:42):**  You can pay the normal book price or you can pay what you think it's worth because he  
**[0:02:47-0:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:02:47):**  reasoned and I think he's perfectly right.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:02:49):**  He cannot know and I cannot know what this course, this content, these lessons are worth  
**[0:02:54-0:02:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:02:54):**  to you. So if you have the means, I invite you to think and if this course has created  
**[0:02:59-0:03:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:02:59):**  or is created value for you to consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:03:04):**  You can find all the information and the links how to do that in the description below.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:03:09):**  Just to give you an idea, if I would charge this to a financial institution or something  
**[0:03:16-0:03:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:03:16):**  else from a distance, this course would probably cost around four hundred dollars.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:03:21):**  Very important, this is not financial advice, it's not investment advice, seek financial  
**[0:03:26-0:03:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:03:26):**  advice before making any investment.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:03:30):**  Now, let's get to the content of this lesson.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:03:33):**  What is regenerative agriculture?  
**[0:03:35-0:03:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:03:35):**  A lot of people ask me, can you give me a definition?  
**[0:03:37-0:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:03:37):**  What is it? What is it not?  
**[0:03:39-0:03:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:03:39):**  And that's very, very difficult, but let's first look at a definition I found online.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:03:43):**  Regenerative agriculture is a system of farming principles and practices that increases  
**[0:03:47-0:03:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:03:47):**  biodiversity and riches soil, improves watersheds and enhances ecosystem services.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:03:53):**  So if you look at this in short, if you had to really boil it down to the essence, regenerative  
**[0:03:58-0:04:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:03:58):**  agriculture is building soils.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:04:00):**  That's it. That's the first question I was asked to farmers.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:04:03):**  It's the first question asked to investors, to ag tech companies, to food companies like  
**[0:04:07-0:04:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:04:07):**  are you directly or indirectly helping to build soil?  
**[0:04:11-0:04:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:04:11):**  Because at the end of the day, it's nature building soils and we're helping it.  
**[0:04:14-0:04:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:04:14):**  We're managing, we're nudging, we're facilitating.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:04:18):**  And now let's get to the problem of the definition.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:04:20):**  As regenerative agriculture is not a thing, it's not a zero or one.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:04:24):**  You cannot, you're either not regenerative or you are.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:04:28):**  It's very difficult, probably nearly impossible or impossible to find a definition because  
**[0:04:32-0:04:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:04:32):**  the definition means it's very clear what is and what is not.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:04:36):**  Like with certified organic, you're either certified or you're not.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:04:39):**  It's much easier to, there's a whole description in the article of a friend of mine, Ethan  
**[0:04:45-0:04:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:04:45):**  Soloviev, that I've used a lot for this lesson that I will link below, why a definition doesn't  
**[0:04:50-0:04:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:04:50):**  make sense in regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:04:52):**  It's much more helpful to look at it from a continuum perspective.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:04:58):**  On one side, it's very degenerative, extractive.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:05:04):**  And slowly, if you move more, in this case to the green, you're going to see that it's  
**[0:05:08-0:05:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:05:08):**  slowly, if you move more in this case to the green side, it's getting more regenerative.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:05:12):**  Ethan did a great job, does a great job in his article to look at the different parts  
**[0:05:17-0:05:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:05:17):**  of the agriculture system and shows how they can be degenerative or regenerative.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:05:23):**  So we'll have a look at it.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:05:24):**  The next slide is very, very full.  
**[0:05:26-0:05:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:05:26):**  I know that and I will go into a few more details, but I invite you definitely after  
**[0:05:31-0:05:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:05:31):**  this lesson to have a look at the article and let me know what you think and let Ethan  
**[0:05:34-0:05:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:05:34):**  know what you think.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:05:35):**  So here you see the different parts of agriculture from the characteristics, the inputs  
**[0:05:40-0:05:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:05:40):**  and the practices, and they can all range from very degenerative on the left to very  
**[0:05:44-0:05:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:05:44):**  regenerative, the green side.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:05:46):**  So let's have a look at the three parts.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:05:50):**  First up, the characteristics, looking at economic sustainability, it's very clear that  
**[0:05:56-0:06:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:05:56):**  and one of the reasons we're recording the podcast that regenerative agriculture can  
**[0:06:00-0:06:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:06:00):**  be profitable, can be investable and can generate not only all the nice other impacts  
**[0:06:06-0:06:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:06:06):**  we want to have, but also a financial return.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:06:10):**  Then it looks at diversity, resilience, crops and products.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:06:12):**  And it's clear that in all agriculture systems or many agriculture systems, you can be  
**[0:06:17-0:06:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:06:17):**  either you can be very degenerative, but you can also be very regenerative.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:06:21):**  Then look at inputs where, for example, does where does the input that a farm uses come  
**[0:06:28-0:06:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:06:28):**  from, is it international, national, regional, local or on the farm?  
**[0:06:31-0:06:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:06:31):**  Where does the fertility come from?  
**[0:06:33-0:06:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:06:33):**  And here we can already see some of the confusion that starts with organic certified  
**[0:06:39-0:06:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:06:39):**  organic could use a lot of manure or from plants could use manure that comes  
**[0:06:43-0:06:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:06:43):**  internationally, for instance.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:06:44):**  So it could be partly it could be perfectly certified organic, but absolutely not  
**[0:06:50-0:06:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:06:50):**  regenerative could be plowing, which is something we'll see in the next slide.  
**[0:06:54-0:07:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:06:54):**  So it really is important to take a holistic view of all the inputs, the practices and  
**[0:07:00-0:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:07:00):**  the characteristics of a farm to see how far along they are in on the regenerative  
**[0:07:05-0:07:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:07:05):**  journey.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:07:06):**  They will never be done.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:07:07):**  If you talk to very experienced regenerative farmers, they will tell you that they're  
**[0:07:10-0:07:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:07:10):**  never done.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:07:11):**  They discover every year that they can go more complex.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:07:14):**  They can go more chaotic.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:07:16):**  They can go deeper and deeper and deeper.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:07:18):**  And these are the practices I mentioned.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:07:20):**  In this case, let's look at tillage.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:07:21):**  You're very high tillage is very difficult to be regenerative.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:07:24):**  If you're low tillage, you could be depending on the systems you use, disease  
**[0:07:27-0:07:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:07:27):**  management.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:07:28):**  If you're spraying a lot of chemical pesticides, very difficult to be regenerative.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:07:32):**  If you're using biological pesticides, you're on your way, but nobody would argue  
**[0:07:37-0:07:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:07:37):**  that you're fully regenerative or you are very much advanced.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:07:41):**  If you're using an ecosystem approach, you're on your way to being regenerative.  
**[0:07:45-0:07:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:07:45):**  Or you are very much advanced if you're using an ecosystem approach, you're getting  
**[0:07:50-0:07:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:07:50):**  there.  
**[0:07:50-0:07:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:07:50):**  And if you look at guiding frameworks, obviously, you can look at carbon farming,  
**[0:07:55-0:07:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:07:55):**  agroforestry, organic, diversified.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:07:57):**  I mean, there's so many different parts, but I think this continuum really helps you.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:08:01):**  And I would really, I've seen somebody actually using this and who sent it to an  
**[0:08:07-0:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:08:07):**  agriculture company that he was interested in investing and asked the company to rate  
**[0:08:12-0:08:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:08:12):**  themselves.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:08:13):**  So where are they on these lines, which I think is a great way to use this tool.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:08:17):**  And I would invite you, obviously, credit Ethan for creating this and let him know  
**[0:08:22-0:08:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:08:22):**  because he's always happy to hear.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:08:25):**  And then just to finish off the whole definition versus what is regenerative  
**[0:08:30-0:08:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:08:30):**  agriculture discussion, Daniel made a very nice comment once.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:08:33):**  And he said, we're organic really prouder itself on we are free of, we are free of  
**[0:08:38-0:08:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:08:38):**  chemical inputs.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:08:39):**  We are free of chemical fertilizer, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:08:42):**  In regenerative agriculture, we're all in all the nutrients, all the fertilization,  
**[0:08:48-0:08:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:08:48):**  et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:08:50-0:08:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:08:50):**  So I hope this helps.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:08:51):**  If you want to dig deeper, read the article, Ethan, obviously.  
**[0:08:55-0:09:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:08:55):**  If you want to dig very deep and go to the No Regrets initiative, which is an initiative  
**[0:09:00-0:09:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:09:00):**  of Sally Calhoun and Esther Park, who we've had on the podcast a number of times.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:09:04):**  They created an amazing website full of resources.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:09:07):**  You can just scratch your surface there or you can go really deep in soil health in a  
**[0:09:11-0:09:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:09:11):**  philosophy of regeneration, regeneration, business models, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:09:15):**  You can really lose a few weeks here, I think, in terms of in terms of reading and  
**[0:09:18-0:09:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:09:18):**  follow up, but it's absolutely amazing.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:09:21):**  You want to read some books?  
**[0:09:22-0:09:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:09:22):**  I always recommend Growing a Revolution, David Montgomery, who was on the show.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:09:26):**  You can find his interview here or and actually because both of them are great.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:09:30):**  Kiss the ground, the book.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:09:31):**  Also follow the community, but definitely also read the book.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:09:36):**  And most importantly, honestly, visit the farm.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:09:38):**  Go and visit local farmers that are building soil.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:09:42):**  How do you find out?  
**[0:09:42-0:09:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:09:42):**  Ask the question, are you building soil?  
**[0:09:44-0:09:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:09:44):**  And if they completely lit up and start sharing about the cover crops they use, a  
**[0:09:49-0:09:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:09:49):**  rotation, et cetera, et cetera, you have a very interesting conversation, I think.  
**[0:09:54-0:09:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:09:54):**  So ask them and the team about their management, the soils and ask questions and listen.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/course/#t=0:09:59):**  There's no better way to learn more about regenerative agriculture than to listen.

## Venture opportunities for a regenerative Food System - Fresh Convo  
**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  
**[0:00:05-0:00:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:00:05):**  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com or in the links below.  
**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:00:14):**  Welcome you're going to listen to the recording of a fresh convo recorded in October 2021  
**[0:00:21-0:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:00:21):**  where we talk about the missing venture opportunities, what people should be building in the regen  
**[0:00:26-0:00:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:00:26):**  ag and food space.  
**[0:00:27-0:00:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:00:27):**  We talk about nutrient density, we talk about the difficulties of regenerative agriculture  
**[0:00:32-0:00:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:00:32):**  and when you're integrating animals and a whole lot more.  
**[0:00:37-0:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:00:37):**  If you want to attend one of these live, just check the link below in the description and  
**[0:00:42-0:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:00:42):**  hope to see you soon.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:00:44):**  Enjoy.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:00:45):**  Welcome everyone.  
**[0:00:46-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:00:46):**  I haven't introduced myself properly, so I will do that as well.  
**[0:00:49-0:00:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:00:49):**  I'm Bart, I'm one of the co-founders of Fresh Ventures Video and we are on a mission to  
**[0:00:56-0:01:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:00:56):**  build two to four new organizations, steward owned organizations that can help accelerate  
**[0:01:01-0:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:01:01):**  the transition and build a truly regenerative food system.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:01:06):**  We are currently actively recruiting 30 people that will work from November till April next  
**[0:01:12-0:01:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:01:12):**  year on kickstarting some of these new organizations.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:01:16):**  So if you know people that are very interested to get into the space in an entrepreneurial  
**[0:01:21-0:01:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:01:21):**  way, please do reach out.  
**[0:01:24-0:01:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:01:24):**  But for now I want to hand it over to my co-host actually, Koen, who traditionally opens with  
**[0:01:30-0:01:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:01:30):**  his most recent learnings talking to everyone in the regenerative food space.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:01:37):**  I wish I was talking to everyone.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:01:39):**  No, the recent learnings, I was thinking about it today as we were prepping for this call  
**[0:01:45-0:01:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:01:45):**  and I wanted to point to, and I'll put it in the chat as well, two reports actually  
**[0:01:49-0:01:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:01:49):**  I read very recently over the last days.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:01:52):**  One of Ellen MacArthur, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, sorry, that released their latest  
**[0:01:56-0:01:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:01:56):**  food.  
**[0:01:57-0:01:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:01:57):**  I think it's called the Big Food Redesign.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:01:59):**  And the main point there, I think what would really, and we have somebody actually joining  
**[0:02:04-0:02:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:02:04):**  now who is very aware of that, but their main point is you cannot push Regen Egg if we just  
**[0:02:10-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:02:10):**  source better and work with farmers on one ingredient, for instance, grain or potatoes,  
**[0:02:15-0:02:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:02:15):**  grain potatoes, sweeteners and dairy, and they really push for, we have to redesign  
**[0:02:22-0:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:02:22):**  food products and we have to buy the full rotation as Den Barber likes to say, or buy  
**[0:02:27-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:02:27):**  the full agroforestry products.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:02:30):**  And that means we probably have to make other types of cookies, other types of breakfast  
**[0:02:34-0:02:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:02:34):**  cereals, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:02:36):**  And we cannot rely on just making one type of grain or the corn a bit better and then  
**[0:02:40-0:02:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:02:40):**  make regenerative corn flakes or whatever that would mean, which is a very logical insight,  
**[0:02:45-0:02:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:02:45):**  but it's the first time I think a big organization who has all the large food companies, being  
**[0:02:50-0:02:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:02:50):**  a member of them, puts that on the agenda.  
**[0:02:53-0:02:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:02:53):**  Like you have to change your recipes.  
**[0:02:54-0:02:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:02:54):**  You cannot just source a bit better.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:02:57):**  And it's a good reminder and we need iconic products.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:03:00):**  They made a very interesting modeling exercise to see the impact of sourcing better versus  
**[0:03:06-0:03:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:03:06):**  sourcing regeneratively from a landscape.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:03:09):**  And the impact is, as far as their models go, a lot more interesting, a lot more, especially  
**[0:03:14-0:03:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:03:14):**  on biodiversity, carbon, et cetera.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:03:16):**  So that I really enjoyed.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:03:18):**  And I think there'll be a lot of space.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:03:20):**  We talked about it last time as well for food companies to do that, to start sourcing multiple  
**[0:03:24-0:03:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:03:24):**  ingredients from the same farmer or multiple ingredients from the same landscape.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:03:29):**  And we're going to hopefully see a lot there.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:03:31):**  And it's sort of connected to the second report or second paper.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:03:34):**  It was more an update on what has been happening on nutrient density.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:03:37):**  What do we already know with the connection between healthy soil, healthy produce, healthy  
**[0:03:42-0:03:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:03:42):**  gut systems, healthy people and healthy ecosystems.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:03:46):**  Croton Institute, David Lasax and Mandy, and I'm blanking on her surname, wrote a great  
**[0:03:51-0:03:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:03:51):**  overview paper of what we know, what we don't know and what we definitely should research.  
**[0:03:55-0:03:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:03:55):**  I'll put them both in the chat.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:03:58):**  It's packed with, I think there were over 200 notes or 200 links to other reports to  
**[0:04:03-0:04:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:04:03):**  if you really want to dive deep in this topic.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:04:06):**  But I think we're absolutely at the beginning.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:04:08):**  It's something they show as well.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:04:09):**  It's too complex probably to ever completely understand.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:04:12):**  But it's very interesting.  
**[0:04:14-0:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:04:14):**  It's too interesting to not dive deep into it as it could be the key to food as medicine  
**[0:04:18-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:04:18):**  and a lot of consumer demand that's currently going for the latest superfood.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:04:23):**  And we should be pushing towards more interesting regeneratively grown or grown with regenerative  
**[0:04:28-0:04:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:04:28):**  practices ingredients.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:04:30):**  So those were the two main things.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:04:33):**  And I'm very much looking forward to this combo.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:04:37):**  Thank you, Kun.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:04:38):**  Actually, I see that Matthijs joined as well.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:04:45):**  And that links quite directly, I think, to what you said with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation,  
**[0:04:50-0:04:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:04:50):**  some of the things they are working on.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:04:52):**  Matthijs, are you also actually available?  
**[0:04:56-0:05:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:04:56):**  If so, could you unmute?  
**[0:05:01-0:05:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:05:01):**  Just for everyone to, I'll intro Matthijs while he's unmuting.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:05:07):**  Matthijs is one of the founders of Jack Bean, Vegan Fast Cuisine and probably always, but  
**[0:05:15-0:05:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:05:15):**  recently more and more they're working on where their inputs are coming from.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:05:20):**  And I think there's a lot to tell there as well.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:05:22):**  But Matthijs, I think you're there.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:05:24):**  Hello, I'm here.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:05:25):**  How are you doing?  
**[0:05:26-0:05:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:05:26):**  I'm good.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:05:27):**  A bit of a cold.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:05:30):**  So you might hear that from my voice, but I'm feeling fine.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:05:35):**  All right.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:05:36):**  Yeah, Kun just elaborated a little bit about like buying a landscape or working with a  
**[0:05:41-0:05:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:05:41):**  farmer and not buying a single crop or produce.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:05:46):**  You have been working together closely with a farmer in the Netherlands.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:05:50):**  Can you share a little bit more about how you, what you are doing in this context?  
**[0:05:56-0:05:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:05:56):**  Sure.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:05:57):**  So in 2018, we started a new restaurant concept called Jack Bean, where we focus on plant  
**[0:06:04-0:06:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:06:04):**  based foods sourced from local farmers.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:06:09):**  And my co-founder is Pepijn Smijnck.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:06:11):**  He used to work with a lot of farmers in the proximity of Rotterdam, where we are located.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:06:16):**  And one of them is Jeroen Klompe.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:06:19):**  So from day one, we've been working with him.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:06:23):**  But only until last year, you know, I had a bit of an epiphany on regenerative farming.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:06:31):**  Of course, we've been talking about this subject with Jeroen quite often.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:06:37):**  But for some reason with us, it never really, in Dutch we say, het kwartje was nog niet  
**[0:06:43-0:06:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:06:43):**  helemaal gevallen.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:06:44):**  So we didn't really fully understand what the impact of regenerative farming meant for  
**[0:06:52-0:06:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:06:52):**  us.  
**[0:06:53-0:06:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:06:53):**  When we started this company not to, you know, be the next vegan fast food chain or whatever.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:06:59):**  We really wanted to showcase that you can eat in a far more sustainable way and work  
**[0:07:05-0:07:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:07:05):**  on a full supply chain.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:07:07):**  So that's why we also worked with Jeroen.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:07:10):**  But I only recently understood that regenerative farming is such an inherent part of our mission  
**[0:07:17-0:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:07:17):**  that we should really put more effort into this matter.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:07:21):**  So we agreed with Jeroen, together with Soil Heroes as well, that we are going to buy more  
**[0:07:32-0:07:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:07:32):**  ingredients from Jeroen and also support him in, yeah, for him to make it possible to grow  
**[0:07:39-0:07:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:07:39):**  more crops in a regenerative way.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:07:43):**  So for next year, we will start with 15 acres.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:07:46):**  So these are 15 ingredients that we source from him that are all grown, yeah, according  
**[0:07:54-0:07:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:07:54):**  to the regenerative principles.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:07:56):**  And Soil Heroes supports us in this whole process.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:08:01):**  And maybe to extend on that, your co-founder Pepijn, he's a chef.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:08:06):**  He works on the taste and developing the products as well.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:08:11):**  But he has put a lot of work, I think, as well to change the recipe, like Koen said,  
**[0:08:17-0:08:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:08:17):**  right, to be able to do this?  
**[0:08:19-0:08:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:08:19):**  Yeah.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:08:20):**  So a nice example is that we used to work with a local bakery for our burger buns.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:08:27):**  Very nice baker.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:08:28):**  But we were growing a bit too big for her.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:08:30):**  So we had to look for a new partner for the buns because we don't make them ourselves.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:08:36):**  And together with Jeroen and a baker that he knows very well, we developed, I believe,  
**[0:08:43-0:08:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:08:43):**  the first regenerative burger bun in the world.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:08:46):**  So that's pretty cool.  
**[0:08:47-0:09:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:08:47):**  So we use his grains and Pepijn makes a fermentation that we add to the, help me out, what's meal  
**[0:09:01-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:09:01):**  in English?  
**[0:09:02-0:09:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:09:02):**  Flour.  
**[0:09:03-0:09:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:09:03):**  Super sharp.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:09:04):**  The flour.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:09:05):**  The flour.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:09:06):**  Thank you.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:09:07):**  Sorry.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:09:08):**  And this was really a fantastic trajectory because the baker was also challenged a lot  
**[0:09:13-0:09:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:09:13):**  because he had to find a new way to make his buns in a new process.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:09:21):**  And he was happy like a little child when he came presenting his bun that was super  
**[0:09:27-0:09:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:09:27):**  tasty, nice structure, good quality and made from regenerative ingredients.  
**[0:09:32-0:09:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:09:32):**  So we were quite proud.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:09:34):**  I think all of us are the farmer, the baker and us.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:09:39):**  So that's a nice example of how, yeah, I think from a mission or a vision that we have, we  
**[0:09:44-0:09:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:09:44):**  can also stimulate our partners to develop new products that can live up to this mission.  
**[0:09:53-0:09:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:09:53):**  Yeah, great.  
**[0:09:55-0:09:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:09:55):**  Thank you for everyone.  
**[0:09:56-0:10:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:09:56):**  If you have questions for Matthijs or you just want to join in, feel free to raise your  
**[0:10:00-0:10:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:10:00):**  hand or ask a question in the chat.  
**[0:10:03-0:10:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:10:03):**  One thing I wanted to ask you, Matthijs, you have been active now in the space in developing  
**[0:10:09-0:10:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:10:09):**  products and developing a brand which is well becoming potentially a regenerative brand  
**[0:10:16-0:10:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:10:16):**  coming from that side.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:10:18):**  What are maybe opportunities you see that you would like to jump on but you actually  
**[0:10:24-0:10:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:10:24):**  can't now or what are other opportunities you see in the space that might be interesting  
**[0:10:29-0:10:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:10:29):**  for others to move into?  
**[0:10:32-0:10:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:10:32):**  Well, personally, I really believe that regenerative is the next big wave beyond organic.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:10:41):**  So I think what we'll see in retail as well is that more and more brands will launch regenerative  
**[0:10:48-0:10:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:10:48):**  foods in supermarkets and in other retail spaces.  
**[0:10:54-0:11:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:10:54):**  So I think that's a very interesting trend also from a commercial perspective.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:11:01):**  But for me, it's mostly interesting because from an impact perspective, I think this is  
**[0:11:06-0:11:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:11:06):**  really something that needs to be done.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:11:09):**  And we need some bold pioneers that are going to be the first ones to launch these kind  
**[0:11:15-0:11:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:11:15):**  of products.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:11:17):**  And our focus is really on building the restaurant chain.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:11:19):**  But we also see a lot of opportunity.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:11:22):**  For example, our burger patties or this regenerative bun, they could also be sold in retail space.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:11:30):**  But we have a challenge where we have to focus.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:11:33):**  We cannot do everything at the same time.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:11:35):**  So parallel to building the restaurant concept, we're also looking for strategic partners  
**[0:11:39-0:11:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:11:39):**  to develop retail lines.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:11:45):**  Thank you.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:11:46):**  We got some people now getting triggered as well.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:11:49):**  And I'm interested in this question for Mattheijs.  
**[0:11:56-0:12:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:11:56):**  How has Soy Heroes helped you or is helping you currently or supporting you in this mission?  
**[0:12:00-0:12:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:12:00):**  What's the role of Soy Heroes in this case?  
**[0:12:04-0:12:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:12:04):**  Well, I mean, it's a fairly early cooperation.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:12:08):**  So we just launched this before the summer.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:12:11):**  So for this year, we're focusing on two ingredients that we're buying.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:12:17):**  So this is the first year where we're doing the first measurements.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:12:20):**  We have a meeting early November where we're going to make a plan for next year.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:12:27):**  So how Jeroen is going to grow those 15 ingredients and what needs to be done in order, you know,  
**[0:12:34-0:12:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:12:34):**  from all the measurement, the measurement and the, what do you call it, how he's going  
**[0:12:43-0:12:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:12:43):**  to shift from regular agriculture to regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:12:51-0:12:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:12:51):**  So I think, of course, the relationship is a bit strange because Jeroen is also the co-founder  
**[0:12:56-0:13:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:12:56):**  of Soy Heroes, but they're the company that supports us mostly and Jeroen is the farmer.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:13:04):**  So that's how we try to divide the roles a little bit.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:13:09):**  I think an amazing question from Sashie, and we'll get to the other ones as well in the  
**[0:13:14-0:13:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:13:14):**  chat, but how has been the response?  
**[0:13:16-0:13:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:13:16):**  This is too early to tell on the regenerative side, of course, but in general, how has been  
**[0:13:20-0:13:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:13:20):**  the response in the restaurant?  
**[0:13:21-0:13:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:13:21):**  Because I know you've been highlighting the farmers, highlighting the journey, highlighting  
**[0:13:26-0:13:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:13:26):**  your choices you've been making.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:13:28):**  What have you seen as a response from your daily customers that walk in and want to get  
**[0:13:32-0:13:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:13:32):**  something to eat fast and nutrient dense?  
**[0:13:35-0:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:13:35):**  Well, if it relates to regenerative, we hardly get any response.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:13:39):**  So that's also interesting.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:13:42):**  It's also because we haven't been highlighting it so much, but when we launched this cooperation  
**[0:13:47-0:13:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:13:47):**  with Soy Heroes and Jeroen, there was a lot of positive response, but mostly from people  
**[0:13:51-0:13:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:13:51):**  within this bubble, all of us here, everybody who knows what regenerative agriculture is  
**[0:13:58-0:14:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:13:58):**  or slightly knows what it is.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:14:01):**  They really support us if they know us in the fact that we try to take this next step.  
**[0:14:05-0:14:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:14:05):**  But for the regular customer, they don't know.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:14:09):**  Do you see a role there?  
**[0:14:10-0:14:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:14:10):**  Maybe they don't care either.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:14:12):**  So I think that's also a big task for us that we inform them, but this is quite difficult.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:14:17):**  So we haven't put a lot of effort in that yet.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:14:21):**  That's mostly for next year.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:14:24):**  But I think that's going to be quite a challenge to communicate how important this is to the  
**[0:14:31-0:14:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:14:31):**  regular customer that walks into a restaurant.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:14:33):**  I mean, for people that don't know us, we are right in front of Rotterdam Central Station.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:14:38):**  So we don't only serve for vegans.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:14:40):**  We basically get anybody that just walks in.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:14:43):**  But for the regular Rotterdammer, if you talk about, I mean, talking about plant based food  
**[0:14:49-0:14:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:14:49):**  is already a lot.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:14:52):**  Regenerative is the next phase.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:14:53):**  So that's a big challenge.  
**[0:14:56-0:14:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:14:56):**  Anybody has good examples?  
**[0:14:58-0:15:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:14:58):**  We just have to make sure that it's super, super, super tasty.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:15:02):**  And if we make sure that it's super tasty, and hopefully we can also start proving that  
**[0:15:07-0:15:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:15:07):**  it's more nutritious in the long run.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:15:09):**  I mean, I think those are the two first important elements of taste and health or nutrition.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:15:18):**  And then, you know, all of us together, we have to find a way how we can communicate  
**[0:15:22-0:15:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:15:22):**  about this topic because regenerative, the term itself is difficult.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:15:27):**  Now, I think a big challenge.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:15:30):**  Yeah.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:15:31):**  Thank you, Matthijs.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:15:34):**  I wanted to see if Daniel Bercci, if I said correctly, he said he was there starting a  
**[0:15:41-0:15:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:15:41):**  region egg brand in Switzerland as well.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:15:43):**  I just wanted to check in with you, Daniel, what kind of brand you are starting and also  
**[0:15:48-0:15:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:15:48):**  what your experience is with the cool farm tool.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:15:50):**  Thank you, Bart.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:15:51):**  It's great to be here and great to see old colleagues.  
**[0:15:56-0:16:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:15:56):**  And well, we decided we want to start a brand and it's based on outcome monitoring.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:16:01):**  And we decided to take the cool farm tool, which is a widely used carbon footprint calculate  
**[0:16:07-0:16:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:16:07):**  farm level, just to be able to monitor progress at farm level.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:16:13):**  We also introduced, for example, animal welfare index.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:16:16):**  And what we decided, we don't have a specific standard where farmers have to comply with  
**[0:16:21-0:16:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:16:21):**  to start, but they have to define some kind of guiding principles and a long term goal  
**[0:16:26-0:16:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:16:26):**  for the farm.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:16:28):**  And based on that, they can apply for the brand and they can use the brand, they can  
**[0:16:31-0:16:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:16:31):**  use the brand for direct market, direct sales.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:16:34):**  And we found that the term regenerative works quite well in Switzerland because it's quite  
**[0:16:38-0:16:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:16:38):**  well understood what it means.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:16:40):**  As soon as it's linked to food, people understand, well, it has to do, it will improve something  
**[0:16:46-0:16:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:16:46):**  and the reaction was really positive.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:16:48):**  We have done a survey with an institute, about 2000 consumers and more than 65% of consumers,  
**[0:16:55-0:17:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:16:55):**  they really appreciated that term and that message behind, which was focusing on climate,  
**[0:17:00-0:17:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:17:00):**  soil and biodiversity.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:17:02):**  Means a focus on climate, of course, but we always make sure it's combined with the other  
**[0:17:07-0:17:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:17:07):**  messages.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:17:08):**  And I think it's an opportunity because of course the organic movement is quite strong  
**[0:17:12-0:17:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:17:12):**  now, but it started small.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:17:14):**  And if we have, let's say a brand that is more open access and allows more people to  
**[0:17:20-0:17:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:17:20):**  join, having a positive impact on the ecosystem at the end, that will be more, let's say mainstream,  
**[0:17:27-0:17:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:17:27):**  there is more mainstream potential, I guess.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:17:30):**  So we start with 100 farmers.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:17:34):**  We start small, but we think it's interest from the industry.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:17:38):**  We heard from Nestle, we heard from others that want to source, let's say regenerative  
**[0:17:43-0:17:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:17:43):**  culture based products, but they don't really know what it is.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:17:47):**  So our goal is to be first to define it before we have the big brands that will define it  
**[0:17:52-0:17:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:17:52):**  and tell farmers what they have to do.  
**[0:17:55-0:18:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:17:55):**  Thank you for your effort and taking fresh branches, what you're doing is great.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:18:01):**  Thank you, Daniel.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:18:02):**  You wanted to respond to that, Kun, or, because I have a question, but.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:18:08):**  Go ahead.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:18:09):**  So it's more like a certification or a label that you're developing than that you're developing  
**[0:18:16-0:18:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:18:16):**  specific brands, right?  
**[0:18:18-0:18:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:18:18):**  It's a label that other brands can work with.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:18:20):**  Our goal is to be seen as brand at the end.  
**[0:18:24-0:18:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:18:24):**  At the beginning, it's really for direct marketing.  
**[0:18:26-0:18:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:18:26):**  So the farmer can put it on its product, on the farm, shop or for delivery or what else.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:18:33):**  But we think about cooperation with, for example, muesli producers in Switzerland, that then  
**[0:18:39-0:18:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:18:39):**  we work with that brand and not as a label, but as a promise for, let's say, for a better  
**[0:18:45-0:18:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:18:45):**  nature, better ecosystem.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:18:47):**  And it's more, let's say, it's the ambition behind.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:18:51):**  So for example, to reduce carbon footprint by 50 percent by 2030.  
**[0:18:56-0:19:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:18:56):**  And that will basically the brands will support that message.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:19:01):**  And what we don't want to do, we don't want to have retailers joining.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:19:06):**  So it's purely, let's say, focusing on alternative marketing streams where we have more opportunities  
**[0:19:14-0:19:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:19:14):**  to communicate directly to consumers or to communicate not only at the shelf, but with  
**[0:19:20-0:19:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:19:20):**  social media, for example.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:19:22):**  So I think the retailers, they need standards.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:19:24):**  And we see that farmers, they don't like standards because every farm is different.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:19:28):**  So we need to find ways how every farmer can have access to this movement and be able to  
**[0:19:34-0:19:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:19:34):**  have a premium price at the end without having to comply with standards.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:19:38):**  Let's be honest, that don't make sense in every circumstance.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:19:41):**  All right.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:19:44):**  Thank you, Daniel.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:19:45):**  Yeah, I actually wanted to invite a colleague of mine, Murray, if you're still here, Murray,  
**[0:19:56-0:20:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:19:56):**  to maybe tease out more responses and also share a little bit of our thinking currently.  
**[0:20:03-0:20:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:20:03):**  Maybe you can briefly introduce yourself and share a little bit about, well, more holistically,  
**[0:20:10-0:20:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:20:10):**  what we have been seeing and the questions we are playing with in this area.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:20:14):**  Yeah, sure.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:20:15):**  So I think, you know, that's given, like, I think a good introduction to what we're  
**[0:20:19-0:20:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:20:19):**  doing at Fresh.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:20:20):**  And really, we have been looking at the agri-food system for some time collectively.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:20:26):**  And we've really put together, I think, and I'd say it's a non-exhaustive list, for sure.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:20:31):**  I'll say that in advance, but probably 10 key opportunity areas or missions that we  
**[0:20:36-0:20:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:20:36):**  were quite interested to dig into.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:20:37):**  And there's a lot of depth in each one.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:20:40):**  So maybe I'll share these.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:20:41):**  And without overloading people, I'll share the 10.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:20:43):**  And I think I have particular areas I'm quite interested to dig into.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:20:47):**  I think the first one is really how we think about how do we really rethink and scale up  
**[0:20:53-0:20:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:20:53):**  the inputs we need for regenerative farming, whether it's really having this diverse and  
**[0:20:57-0:20:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:20:57):**  abundant access for seeds for people?  
**[0:20:59-0:21:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:20:59):**  How do we rethink the feed that's required?  
**[0:21:02-0:21:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:21:02):**  How do we think about nutrient cycling effectively in a regenerative system?  
**[0:21:06-0:21:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:21:06):**  So that's sort of part one.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:21:07):**  But two is it's really fundamental to think about how we can actually regenerate sort  
**[0:21:13-0:21:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:21:13):**  of our landscape level as well, and how we really enable different actors to do that.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:21:20):**  And where are the models in doing that that are sort of scalable?  
**[0:21:23-0:21:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:21:23):**  Third is really key to getting people to, you know, how do we transition farmers to  
**[0:21:28-0:21:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:21:28):**  regenerative practices?  
**[0:21:30-0:21:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:21:30):**  There's a huge knowledge component to this, and it's very context specific.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:21:32):**  You know, what are the barriers that are actually preventing us from disseminating this knowledge  
**[0:21:37-0:21:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:21:37):**  when it's so context specific?  
**[0:21:39-0:21:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:21:39):**  And you know, there's digitization problems and all these kind of things, big challenge.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:21:45):**  So fourth, I think, you know, there's quite a big push, of course, for like, thinking  
**[0:21:49-0:21:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:21:49):**  about smart and precision farming within the conventional space.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:21:52):**  But how do we apply that stuff in the regenerative context?  
**[0:21:56-0:21:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:21:56):**  And what does that look like?  
**[0:21:57-0:22:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:21:57):**  What are the different sort of keys times technologies that we need that really sort  
**[0:22:01-0:22:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:22:01):**  of, you know, enables transitions to happen more quickly, more efficiently, more economically  
**[0:22:06-0:22:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:22:06):**  viable for the farmers, but also reduce the inputs required?  
**[0:22:09-0:22:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:22:09):**  Coon touched on the fifth one, which is really thinking about nutrient dense food.  
**[0:22:16-0:22:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:22:16):**  And I really love that Crotan report.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:22:18):**  Thanks for sharing it.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:22:19):**  It was really, really good.  
**[0:22:22-0:22:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:22:22):**  Another big one is really enabling ecosystem services, and how we enable farmers to undertake  
**[0:22:28-0:22:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:22:28):**  those things, whether it's through sort of market based decisions or otherwise.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:22:34):**  I think we talked about this earlier in the discussions.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:22:36):**  So our seventh one is, how do we really once things leave the farm gate, how do we then,  
**[0:22:44-0:22:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:22:44):**  you know, reach consumers and maybe, you know, think about some more disintermediated value  
**[0:22:49-0:22:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:22:49):**  chains, or how do we think about rebuilding regenerative brands that consumers understand?  
**[0:22:54-0:23:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:22:54):**  How do we think about, you know, maybe farm to fork product chains, for example?  
**[0:23:00-0:23:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:23:00):**  One which is sort of, I guess, an indirect enabler of agriculture is really actually  
**[0:23:06-0:23:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:23:06):**  thinking about how we have non-food uses for, you know, biomass.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:23:12):**  So how do we take, you know, some of the, how do we replace polluting inputs and fossil  
**[0:23:19-0:23:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:23:19):**  fuel based inputs using biomass, but also not overloading sort of arable lands with  
**[0:23:24-0:23:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:23:24):**  that too, which is a big challenge, but also building business models around that for farmers.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:23:29):**  Thinking about what the new sort of localised systems look like, whether that's using vertical  
**[0:23:33-0:23:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:23:33):**  farms, recirculating agriculture systems, how do we help sort of smallholder farmers  
**[0:23:39-0:23:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:23:39):**  have thriving livelihoods, so rethinking about sort of local, rural, coastal communities  
**[0:23:44-0:23:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:23:44):**  and how we make them resilient.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:23:45):**  And finally, is this big one around, you know, really enabling transition finance to flow  
**[0:23:51-0:23:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:23:51):**  and what that looks like in the future, not only in terms of what we're investing in,  
**[0:23:55-0:23:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:23:55):**  but how we're doing it too.  
**[0:23:57-0:24:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:23:57):**  And what the big blockers are that are preventing more capital from flowing in, in a sort of  
**[0:24:01-0:24:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:24:01):**  mission aligned way as opposed to an extractive way.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:24:04):**  So those are like the big 10 sort of missions that we're looking at, probably a lot to take  
**[0:24:09-0:24:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:24:09):**  in.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:24:10):**  I think we can post them on the chat too.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:24:12):**  And I think within those areas, you know, there are tons of different questions around  
**[0:24:17-0:24:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:24:17):**  these missions of like, which we can really get into the depths of.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:24:20):**  And I definitely have some things for the group around particular areas.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:24:24):**  And I think Bar, you've got a couple too.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:24:27):**  But we see really fundamentally interesting opportunities for ventures, right?  
**[0:24:31-0:24:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:24:31):**  So probably lots of unanswered questions at the same time.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:24:35):**  So I think, you know, I think it'd be interesting to dig into some of these areas, some of these  
**[0:24:40-0:24:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:24:40):**  questions and see, you know, what discussions come out of that.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:24:46):**  And also if anyone has any interesting ventures they're already aware of, they think are really  
**[0:24:49-0:24:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:24:49):**  making an impact too.  
**[0:24:51-0:24:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:24:51):**  So that was a very brief ride through.  
**[0:24:55-0:25:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:24:55):**  Very brief, but also very much touching a lot of things, I think.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:25:00):**  But that's great.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:25:01):**  Which one do you think Murray now, because one of the things I would like to sort of  
**[0:25:04-0:25:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:25:04):**  exclude is the ecosystem services.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:25:06):**  I think we've talked about that quite a lot in the conversations.  
**[0:25:10-0:25:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:25:10):**  Very interesting, though.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:25:12):**  I personally am especially also interested on the input side.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:25:15):**  I think it's, I find it hard to get specific there.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:25:18):**  But I wonder what are the, well, what do you want to have emphasis on right now?  
**[0:25:24-0:25:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:25:24):**  Or what do you find maybe difficult also to find answers in?  
**[0:25:28-0:25:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:25:28):**  Yeah, okay.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:25:29):**  I think it's nice, maybe we start with the inputs one.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:25:31):**  I think I'm quite curious.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:25:32):**  I know you had some thoughts around sort of manure management.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:25:35):**  I'm also interested around the sort of idea of really opening up the higher diversity  
**[0:25:40-0:25:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:25:40):**  of seeds, make them more accessible.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:25:41):**  Like what does that look like in a regenerative system in the future?  
**[0:25:45-0:25:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:25:45):**  Like what are the levers we need to pull around that?  
**[0:25:47-0:25:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:25:47):**  As well as, yeah, how that nutrient cycling component that you were talking about, manure.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:25:52):**  Maybe that's a good starting point.  
**[0:25:53-0:25:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:25:53):**  I've got a couple of other areas I think there's tons of juice in too.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:25:58):**  So maybe we'll start there.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:26:00):**  Great.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:26:01):**  Maybe Koen, you can, we already briefly discussed it, but I also wonder what you know is happening  
**[0:26:06-0:26:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:26:06):**  in the input space and how to do that more regeneratively.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:26:11):**  Can you elaborate a little bit and then for everyone else to jump in, please do.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:26:16):**  It's a tricky one as I'm definitely not an input expert.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:26:21):**  And I think I've shared it before at other Convos, we get a lot of requests for being  
**[0:26:26-0:26:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:26:26):**  on the podcast for a novel input company or somebody that makes an ingredient that's the  
**[0:26:30-0:26:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:26:30):**  holy grail that makes your soil amazing wherever you are with any soil, et cetera.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:26:34):**  So there seems to be a lot of noise in this space.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:26:36):**  There's definitely a lot of interesting companies being built.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:26:40):**  It's very difficult, at least for us to distinguish the interesting things from the noise.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:26:48):**  What I see though is a lot of push for more localized and more specific, complex specific.  
**[0:26:55-0:27:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:26:55):**  A lot of farmers are doing that are more advanced in the journey are doing a lot of things themselves,  
**[0:27:01-0:27:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:27:01):**  which obviously doesn't scale in many cases.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:27:03):**  So it's that constant tension, like what do you buy in and where do you get it from?  
**[0:27:07-0:27:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:27:07):**  And simple in terms of manure, what quality is it and what has it been treated and how  
**[0:27:12-0:27:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:27:12):**  many medicines are you going to find in it?  
**[0:27:15-0:27:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:27:15):**  And that's the same with all other inputs.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:27:16):**  So it's a very interesting tension between input companies that are promising a lot of  
**[0:27:22-0:27:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:27:22):**  things and farmers that want to control the food value chain, just as stuff that comes  
**[0:27:29-0:27:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:27:29):**  off the farm, like that start to do things in-house.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:27:31):**  But of course, if you make your own bio fertilizer and you have a large farm, you end up basically  
**[0:27:36-0:27:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:27:36):**  building a brewery, which is not the core business of many farmers.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:27:39):**  So it's I think it's an interesting transition piece.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:27:42):**  It's always like, how long do you need this specific input?  
**[0:27:45-0:27:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:27:45):**  Where is your fertilization coming from?  
**[0:27:47-0:27:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:27:47):**  What kind of insect pressure, et cetera, you're going to get or pest pressure and how do you  
**[0:27:52-0:27:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:27:52):**  going to tackle that?  
**[0:27:53-0:27:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:27:53):**  And the best produce, what we see is it's very, very expensive.  
**[0:27:57-0:28:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:27:57):**  Like it's a very interesting business because the stuff that works, the companies can charge  
**[0:28:02-0:28:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:28:02):**  almost whatever they want.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:28:04):**  Pushing farmers again further into whatever you can make yourself, which is maybe not  
**[0:28:09-0:28:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:28:09):**  that controlled, not that tested, et cetera.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:28:11):**  So also the results vary a lot.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:28:13):**  So I find it a very, very difficult one.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:28:15):**  It's if you can lower the input costs of any farmer, obviously the profitability of the  
**[0:28:20-0:28:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:28:20):**  farm goes up very quickly because it's one of the main costs next to seeds and other  
**[0:28:26-0:28:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:28:26):**  things depending on which sector you're in.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:28:28):**  So it's super interesting.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:28:29):**  I find it extremely difficult to pinpoint to a few great examples of input companies  
**[0:28:36-0:28:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:28:36):**  that really perform amazingly or are super reliable in that sense because there's just  
**[0:28:42-0:28:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:28:42):**  so much out there and so much being promised to farmers and very difficult to verify as  
**[0:28:48-0:28:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:28:48):**  there's not too much research into how they mix together, how they work together, which  
**[0:28:53-0:28:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:28:53):**  context, which climates, et cetera, they work from or they work in.  
**[0:28:55-0:29:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:28:55):**  Yeah, I think it's a lot good.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:29:00):**  Maria, you wanted to respond?  
**[0:29:01-0:29:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:29:01):**  Well, yeah, I was curious when you talk about inputs in that sense, you're talking about  
**[0:29:05-0:29:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:29:05):**  sort of seeds too, or are you referring to, you know, just a-  
**[0:29:10-0:29:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:29:10):**  Not necessarily, but it is an input at the end, I think, or it comes into the farm.  
**[0:29:14-0:29:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:29:14):**  I think if we make it as broad as possible, it has input as well.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:29:19):**  It also has genetics of animals if you have a livestock operation.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:29:25):**  Probably any farmer would like to control it as much as possible, what comes in, and  
**[0:29:30-0:29:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:29:30):**  the truth is now that most of it you just don't know or there's only so far you can  
**[0:29:35-0:29:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:29:35):**  search there or you can trust.  
**[0:29:38-0:29:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:29:38):**  And that's very difficult or very risky, I think, as a food system as well as we're seeing  
**[0:29:44-0:29:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:29:44):**  now in terms of genetics.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:29:46):**  So seeds definitely, yes, seeds is a whole different.  
**[0:29:49-0:29:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:29:49):**  We can spend a whole other hour and we'll probably need some seed experts on that.  
**[0:29:53-0:29:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:29:53):**  Hugely risky as well to buy seeds from three, four huge companies that tomorrow can change  
**[0:29:59-0:30:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:29:59):**  their direction and you're out of broccoli seeds is very risky.  
**[0:30:03-0:30:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:30:03):**  And I think also there we need a lot of innovation and hopefully a lot of diversity literally  
**[0:30:10-0:30:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:30:10):**  in seeds and in companies simply to supply farmers with the choices they need.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:30:16):**  And maybe it's an element of opening up IP, like not having monopolies in there, also  
**[0:30:21-0:30:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:30:21):**  trying to look at greater diversity.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:30:23):**  I actually found quite a good one from Dan Barber, which I'm sure you're aware of, I  
**[0:30:26-0:30:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:30:26):**  think it's Dan Barber, the row seven seeds, which I've shared.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:30:30):**  Fascinating things.  
**[0:30:31-0:30:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:30:31):**  Yeah, thank you for sharing it in the chat.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:30:34):**  There's probably way more we could share too, but I think, yeah, there's lots of different  
**[0:30:38-0:30:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:30:38):**  angles.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:30:39):**  There's like 20 or 200 of them because they all get bought up by large seed companies  
**[0:30:45-0:30:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:30:45):**  at some point, which is very unfortunate.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:30:48):**  It's a great exit for the companies, but it's just too...  
**[0:30:52-0:31:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:30:52):**  Sorry, maybe we can get a beat the Galdaway Samaras.  
**[0:31:00-0:31:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:31:00):**  I think one of the people that voted being a farmer actually involved as well together  
**[0:31:04-0:31:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:31:04):**  with Jesse Davidson, because they both connected to this as well and talked about the integrated  
**[0:31:12-0:31:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:31:12):**  livestock management.  
**[0:31:13-0:31:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:31:13):**  So Jesse introduced it and if I pronounce your name right, shared a little bit about  
**[0:31:19-0:31:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:31:19):**  how you practice it, but also the challenges that you're facing.  
**[0:31:22-0:31:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:31:22):**  Can you maybe elaborate a little bit on what you're doing already and what are the challenges  
**[0:31:27-0:31:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:31:27):**  for you?  
**[0:31:28-0:31:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:31:28):**  Yeah, so we are...  
**[0:31:29-0:31:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:31:29):**  But I'm new to the industry to say that.  
**[0:31:31-0:31:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:31:31):**  I'm coming from the financial industry, moved into regenerative agriculture really just  
**[0:31:35-0:31:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:31:35):**  because we wanted to follow our passion and are now producing regenerative olive oil in  
**[0:31:42-0:31:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:31:42):**  Northern Greece.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:31:44):**  And so what we see around us, we're the only ones incorporating livestock to begin with.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:31:52):**  It really brings up a whole new set of challenges despite the manure and mainly from a regulatory  
**[0:31:59-0:32:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:31:59):**  standpoint because suddenly the paperwork that you have to fill out, the classifications  
**[0:32:03-0:32:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:32:03):**  that you have to follow, the land space being tested for, I don't know, 10,000 kinds of  
**[0:32:09-0:32:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:32:09):**  things plus having to feed the animals, antibiotics or stuff that we don't really want to feed  
**[0:32:15-0:32:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:32:15):**  them because we want to turn their manure into something regenerative for our growth.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:32:20):**  That's a whole different level.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:32:22):**  So we do it, but really more just to be stubborn from a German background and stubbornness  
**[0:32:31-0:32:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:32:31):**  and I want to fix this.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:32:34):**  That's what's driving me and to really just showcase it.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:32:36):**  But I wouldn't recommend it to any other farmer, like someone who really has to depend on it  
**[0:32:43-0:32:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:32:43):**  to only have the farming business.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:32:45):**  We are lucky enough to do freelancing on the site.  
**[0:32:48-0:32:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:32:48):**  I wouldn't recommend it because it's really financially draining, energy draining.  
**[0:32:53-0:32:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:32:53):**  So the majority of our own manure is completely going under the radar.  
**[0:32:58-0:33:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:32:58):**  That is from our donkeys and we do have a lab by now.  
**[0:33:02-0:33:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:33:02):**  So I did the studies with Dr. Elaine Ingham to really analyze it under the microscope.  
**[0:33:08-0:33:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:33:08):**  But it has to be completely under the radar because if not, like following regulations,  
**[0:33:13-0:33:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:33:13):**  it's just something we wouldn't be capable of.  
**[0:33:16-0:33:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:33:16):**  So that's a challenge, definitely.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:33:18):**  The other challenges, I think a lot of that comes from thinking of farms the way they're  
**[0:33:24-0:33:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:33:24):**  structured more in the US, in parts of Europe as well, where you have all of your fields  
**[0:33:29-0:33:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:33:29):**  around the farm.  
**[0:33:30-0:33:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:33:30):**  But for example, in Greece, that's not the case.  
**[0:33:32-0:33:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:33:32):**  All of us are living together in a small village and then all of the fields, all of the groves,  
**[0:33:37-0:33:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:33:37):**  they are completely separate up to 20 kilometers away in what they call a camp.  
**[0:33:42-0:33:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:33:42):**  So there you can't just leave your animals overnight, even electric fencing gets stolen.  
**[0:33:48-0:33:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:33:48):**  It comes with a whole set of challenges.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:33:50):**  And so it's not that easy.  
**[0:33:51-0:33:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:33:51):**  I wouldn't recommend it despite loving it.  
**[0:33:53-0:33:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:33:53):**  But from a business economic perspective, nope, rather by the compost.  
**[0:33:59-0:34:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:33:59):**  Interesting.  
**[0:34:00-0:34:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:34:00):**  Thank you very much.  
**[0:34:03-0:34:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:34:03):**  That's a great perspective as well.  
**[0:34:06-0:34:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:34:06):**  Actually we have been involved in this triggered the question for me as well, coming from a  
**[0:34:11-0:34:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:34:11):**  bit of the other side, actually in the Netherlands, there is a we have a lot of animals, pigs  
**[0:34:16-0:34:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:34:16):**  and cows, and there's a big thing going on and reducing those actually.  
**[0:34:22-0:34:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:34:22):**  And we have been involved in a project where this question is very much on the table as  
**[0:34:27-0:34:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:34:27):**  well.  
**[0:34:30-0:34:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:34:30):**  But they also use the manure and also want to be, well, not be dependent on manure coming  
**[0:34:37-0:34:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:34:37):**  from elsewhere, because then the quality is so hard to assess and also even if you take  
**[0:34:42-0:34:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:34:42):**  it from a landscape perspective or a broader context and just the farm, you take it, you  
**[0:34:46-0:34:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:34:46):**  work with the neighbors.  
**[0:34:47-0:34:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:34:47):**  I feel there's, well, I wouldn't say distrust, but it feels like a big risk to work with  
**[0:34:54-0:34:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:34:54):**  the neighbors to get the manure.  
**[0:34:55-0:34:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:34:55):**  So actually plus it's not regenerative.  
**[0:34:58-0:35:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:34:58):**  It just doesn't make sense from a regenerative standpoint to have the animals in one site  
**[0:35:03-0:35:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:35:03):**  dealing having a farmer dealing with some issues, then transporting and actually causing  
**[0:35:08-0:35:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:35:08):**  emissions to transport the manure, get it worked somewhere to transport it again to  
**[0:35:13-0:35:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:35:13):**  another farm and not to have all of the other benefits, neither for the animal, neither  
**[0:35:18-0:35:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:35:18):**  for the groves or other fields, whether them chewing or something else.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:35:22):**  So exactly.  
**[0:35:24-0:35:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:35:24):**  So it's then then it's externalized.  
**[0:35:26-0:35:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:35:26):**  And so that was very much a problem.  
**[0:35:28-0:35:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:35:28):**  That we, if we stop with the cows and we need to get the manure somewhere else for the scale  
**[0:35:35-0:35:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:35:35):**  of the farm that they have.  
**[0:35:37-0:35:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:35:37):**  So accelerating and also because there's so much pressure now on the decision making with  
**[0:35:43-0:35:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:35:43):**  decreasing the amount of cows, for example, or investing in the infrastructure that you  
**[0:35:49-0:35:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:35:49):**  have, that while in some way accelerating the ways to replace manure or in other ways  
**[0:35:59-0:36:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:35:59):**  than is currently being done, I think can really accelerate those decisions into doing  
**[0:36:05-0:36:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:36:05):**  it more regeneratively without, as you say, just buying it somewhere else where they have  
**[0:36:11-0:36:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:36:11):**  horrible practices or at least not regenerative practices.  
**[0:36:13-0:36:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:36:13):**  So thank you very much and welcome also to probably your daughter for joining in.  
**[0:36:21-0:36:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:36:21):**  I think we also had some questions coming in, Koen, in the chat.  
**[0:36:24-0:36:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:36:24):**  You're always keeping an eye out.  
**[0:36:26-0:36:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:36:26):**  Yeah, I'm trying to answer some.  
**[0:36:28-0:36:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:36:28):**  Richard had one on scalability and which is an enormously complex question.  
**[0:36:34-0:36:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:36:34):**  But I think that the potential for regeneration, we would all agree, is enormous.  
**[0:36:38-0:36:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:36:38):**  If you look at the landscapes we are used to and how degraded they are, that doesn't  
**[0:36:43-0:36:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:36:43):**  mean that we should just scale any farm to infinity.  
**[0:36:46-0:36:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:36:46):**  And so there's definitely a tension there.  
**[0:36:48-0:36:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:36:48):**  And it really depends on the context, the landscapes, what size of farm makes sense.  
**[0:36:54-0:36:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:36:54):**  And even if the farm, if farms in the current form, we know them, in many cases, single  
**[0:36:59-0:37:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:36:59):**  family farms, etc. makes sense at all.  
**[0:37:02-0:37:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:37:02):**  And if there shouldn't be multiple enterprises on top of the same land, which might be holding  
**[0:37:06-0:37:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:37:06):**  a trust and that opens a whole other land ownership discussion.  
**[0:37:10-0:37:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:37:10):**  But I think we're going to see a lot of new models.  
**[0:37:13-0:37:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:37:13):**  But what we've seen definitely is the profitability can be there.  
**[0:37:18-0:37:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:37:18):**  Definitely nodding to the pioneers like we just heard that are trying to find these recipes,  
**[0:37:24-0:37:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:37:24):**  are battling every day with the authorities and the bureaucracy that has not been set  
**[0:37:30-0:37:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:37:30):**  up for this.  
**[0:37:31-0:37:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:37:31):**  They've been set up for a 50,000 or a million chicken indoor factory farm and would never  
**[0:37:38-0:37:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:37:38):**  imagine that these chickens might be integrated in some kind of livestock operation, let alone  
**[0:37:42-0:37:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:37:42):**  under olive trees with donkeys, which of course gets us in a hole.  
**[0:37:46-0:37:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:37:46):**  So we owe it to them to fight these rules and start to also make sense of what kind  
**[0:37:54-0:37:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:37:54):**  of regulations and policies we need, which need a massive overhaul almost everywhere.  
**[0:37:58-0:38:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:37:58):**  But the scale could be there, just maybe not from a single entity, but from many different  
**[0:38:03-0:38:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:38:03):**  ones depending on the landscape.  
**[0:38:05-0:38:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:38:05):**  I see some discussions on integrated livestock and Daniela raised a very good point.  
**[0:38:09-0:38:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:38:09):**  It really depends.  
**[0:38:10-0:38:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:38:10):**  In many cases, it doesn't make sense.  
**[0:38:11-0:38:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:38:11):**  In many cases, it does.  
**[0:38:13-0:38:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:38:13):**  As always, it's context specific and watch out for this is the recipe for everywhere.  
**[0:38:19-0:38:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:38:19):**  Usually that doesn't work.  
**[0:38:20-0:38:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:38:20):**  And usually people, let's say, take a few steps too fast.  
**[0:38:25-0:38:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:38:25):**  What makes sense in that landscape to regenerate?  
**[0:38:27-0:38:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:38:27):**  What makes sense economically and what makes sense policy wise?  
**[0:38:30-0:38:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:38:30):**  Because in many places you cannot do certain things and thus you either have to change  
**[0:38:35-0:38:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:38:35):**  the policy or ignore it or don't do it.  
**[0:38:37-0:38:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:38:37):**  But you have to be aware of that.  
**[0:38:39-0:38:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:38:39):**  I see Daniela also asked a question on the commodity pricing.  
**[0:38:44-0:38:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:38:44):**  As long as you don't get the premiums.  
**[0:38:45-0:38:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:38:45):**  I mean, if your costs are very low, you can sell in the commodity market and turn a profit.  
**[0:38:49-0:38:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:38:49):**  Great for you.  
**[0:38:50-0:38:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:38:50):**  If you can't, you need to find some kind of premium somewhere from someone that wants  
**[0:38:55-0:39:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:38:55):**  to pay more for nutrient density or specific quality levels you might be able to reach  
**[0:39:00-0:39:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:39:00):**  in the beginning or not, or for some kind of story and some kind of journey and transition  
**[0:39:05-0:39:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:39:05):**  you are on.  
**[0:39:06-0:39:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:39:06):**  But if you're planning to play in the commodity markets, you might have some really good years  
**[0:39:10-0:39:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:39:10):**  and might have some really, really bad ones.  
**[0:39:13-0:39:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:39:13):**  And that's, I think, from a risk perspective, very, very risky because it's not up to you  
**[0:39:19-0:39:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:39:19):**  what the coffee market will do.  
**[0:39:20-0:39:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:39:20):**  It's not up to you what the grain market will do.  
**[0:39:22-0:39:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:39:22):**  You're way too small to play in that.  
**[0:39:24-0:39:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:39:24):**  So I agree the big commodity players have their major statements of what they're going  
**[0:39:30-0:39:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:39:30):**  to do, regenerate, and they're sourcing, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:39:32-0:39:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:39:32):**  They keep paying exactly the same prices as they've always done.  
**[0:39:36-0:39:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:39:36):**  And nothing changes.  
**[0:39:37-0:39:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:39:37):**  I think Nestle made some commitments now or at least some announcements that they're going  
**[0:39:42-0:39:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:39:42):**  to pay premiums.  
**[0:39:43-0:39:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:39:43):**  I think we need to follow up on that if they actually do and then push the others to do  
**[0:39:47-0:39:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:39:47):**  the same because you cannot source the same thing.  
**[0:39:50-0:39:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:39:50):**  Ask all kinds of other things, conditions from farmers, and then expect crazy outcomes  
**[0:39:54-0:39:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:39:54):**  and just have the same bill at the end.  
**[0:39:58-0:40:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:39:58):**  So I think I got a few of the questions.  
**[0:40:00-0:40:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:40:00):**  I will go through them and see if there are some others.  
**[0:40:03-0:40:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:40:03):**  I think Daniela also responded to the livestock integration, which Jessie responded to.  
**[0:40:10-0:40:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:40:10):**  But I think that part of the discussion is also in the chat and I think super relevant.  
**[0:40:15-0:40:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:40:15):**  I'm not sure if Jessie also wants to elaborate a little bit on the livestock integration  
**[0:40:20-0:40:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:40:20):**  personally.  
**[0:40:21-0:40:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:40:21):**  She has been involved in that conversation.  
**[0:40:24-0:40:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:40:24):**  I'd be happy to just kind of put my two cents in.  
**[0:40:29-0:40:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:40:29):**  So just as a bit of a background, I'm a master's student studying global food security and  
**[0:40:33-0:40:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:40:33):**  nutrition.  
**[0:40:35-0:40:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:40:35):**  So most of my knowledge is very, I guess I'll say hypothetical.  
**[0:40:39-0:40:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:40:39):**  I don't have a whole lot of practical experience in farm management.  
**[0:40:42-0:40:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:40:42):**  I thought that Danielle brought up a very good point about how livestock integration  
**[0:40:47-0:40:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:40:47):**  is becoming like kind of a mantra when it comes to regenerative agriculture and it's  
**[0:40:51-0:40:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:40:51):**  not necessarily a universal fit as has been mentioned before.  
**[0:40:56-0:41:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:40:56):**  I think when I'm considering livestock management more, what I'm saying is just that no farming  
**[0:41:01-0:41:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:41:01):**  operation that's like completely devoid of any type of animal or insect life is one that  
**[0:41:06-0:41:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:41:06):**  can last long term.  
**[0:41:08-0:41:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:41:08):**  In nature, you don't find an area where there's just plants and no animals or the other way  
**[0:41:12-0:41:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:41:12):**  around.  
**[0:41:14-0:41:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:41:14):**  You have to have both in order to have a resilient system.  
**[0:41:18-0:41:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:41:18):**  And so any type of operation where there's no pest because of all the pesticides or there's  
**[0:41:25-0:41:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:41:25):**  no livestock integrated anywhere is just something that can't really survive.  
**[0:41:30-0:41:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:41:30):**  So I think it is really interesting to bring up the fact that it shouldn't be a universal  
**[0:41:34-0:41:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:41:34):**  solution, but it's definitely one that could work in a lot of areas.  
**[0:41:38-0:41:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:41:38):**  And in those areas, it's not something that's being considered on a large scale right now.  
**[0:41:43-0:41:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:41:43):**  And one of the things that I said earlier was just that I think a big barrier to that  
**[0:41:47-0:41:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:41:47):**  is that livestock farming and like produce and vegetable farming are seen as two different  
**[0:41:52-0:41:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:41:52):**  industries and are operated as such.  
**[0:41:54-0:42:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:41:54):**  And I think that systemically that needs to change in areas where it can in order to kind  
**[0:42:00-0:42:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:42:00):**  of allow farmers to more easily integrate livestock where it is a possible solution.  
**[0:42:06-0:42:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:42:06):**  All right.  
**[0:42:09-0:42:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:42:09):**  Thank you.  
**[0:42:10-0:42:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:42:10):**  Murray?  
**[0:42:11-0:42:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:42:11):**  I'd love actually to dig into the technology topic briefly and maybe we've only got nine  
**[0:42:19-0:42:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:42:19):**  minutes so I don't know if it's too big.  
**[0:42:21-0:42:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:42:21):**  But I'm curious whether this idea of sort of how we use precision farming, smart farming,  
**[0:42:27-0:42:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:42:27):**  whether that's fundamentally at odds with the principles of regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:42:32-0:42:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:42:32):**  I think we're seeing the use of robotics for seed drilling and robotics across farms.  
**[0:42:39-0:42:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:42:39):**  Is this fundamentally something that is actually really going to enable regenerative agriculture  
**[0:42:43-0:42:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:42:43):**  to proliferate or is it actually sort of this tech utopia idea?  
**[0:42:48-0:42:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:42:48):**  And I think there's a range of other things that I've found recently that are pretty interesting  
**[0:42:54-0:42:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:42:54):**  in terms of, you know, I think I read the other day that farm data is now this increasingly  
**[0:42:58-0:42:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:42:58):**  large market.  
**[0:42:59-0:43:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:42:59):**  A lot of bigger companies are looking to actually get into like farm data and owning the data.  
**[0:43:04-0:43:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:43:04):**  And I'm curious, this is a discussion, whether we really see this as a fundamentally important  
**[0:43:09-0:43:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:43:09):**  area to be investing in with really this tech director that sort of the regen angle or whether  
**[0:43:14-0:43:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:43:14):**  there are actually these risks related to it.  
**[0:43:17-0:43:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:43:17):**  And if we think it's interesting, like what are the areas we really think are really interesting?  
**[0:43:21-0:43:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:43:21):**  Is it the robotics?  
**[0:43:22-0:43:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:43:22):**  Is it, you know, sort of sensing to help ecosystem services, the farm data angle?  
**[0:43:29-0:43:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:43:29):**  Very curious.  
**[0:43:30-0:43:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:43:30):**  All of the above.  
**[0:43:31-0:43:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:43:31):**  Sorry?  
**[0:43:32-0:43:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:43:32):**  All of the above.  
**[0:43:33-0:43:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:43:33):**  All of the above.  
**[0:43:34-0:43:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:43:34):**  I mean, you think, you're not like this doesn't go a place within the regen transition, right?  
**[0:43:39-0:43:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:43:39):**  It's like it's going to help accelerate it, you think?  
**[0:43:41-0:43:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:43:41):**  Does it make it more viable?  
**[0:43:42-0:43:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:43:42):**  I think it's any tool like livestock, like finance, like fire, in some cases, like water,  
**[0:43:49-0:43:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:43:49):**  it can be extremely destructive and can be extremely regenerative, really depending  
**[0:43:52-0:43:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:43:52):**  on the intention.  
**[0:43:53-0:43:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:43:53):**  I think we're going to see a lot more technology.  
**[0:43:56-0:44:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:43:56):**  And I think any technology that can help farmers regenerate faster or understand the landscape  
**[0:44:02-0:44:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:44:02):**  better, measure better, but gives them action and real insights of doing things is great.  
**[0:44:09-0:44:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:44:09):**  Anything that takes that away, being the data going to a large company, being a technology  
**[0:44:14-0:44:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:44:14):**  that they cannot open or fix, change, etc., is probably not empowering.  
**[0:44:20-0:44:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:44:20):**  But I see a lot for robotics and I see a lot of potential for a lot of things that now  
**[0:44:26-0:44:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:44:26):**  simply cannot get done because they're not enough hands on the farm that might be able  
**[0:44:30-0:44:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:44:30):**  to get done with other types of hands.  
**[0:44:33-0:44:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:44:33):**  But again, if it helps the farmer to, empowers the farmer to regenerate more, why not?  
**[0:44:37-0:44:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:44:37):**  If it doesn't, I think that's the risk for me at least.  
**[0:44:41-0:44:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:44:41):**  But the same with finance can be an enormous tool and can be an enormous destructive force  
**[0:44:45-0:44:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:44:45):**  as well, as we've seen.  
**[0:44:48-0:44:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:44:48):**  I think I would like to bring in Hannes as well.  
**[0:44:53-0:44:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:44:53):**  He said, and also have a different question, Hannes and Willemijn, both of you actually  
**[0:44:58-0:44:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:44:58):**  to round it off.  
**[0:44:59-0:45:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:44:59):**  But thank you, Murray.  
**[0:45:00-0:45:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:45:00):**  I think we should and will be going deeper into this subject.  
**[0:45:04-0:45:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:45:04):**  But Hannes, Hannes from the EICOUT, you said it depends on the ownership.  
**[0:45:09-0:45:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:45:09):**  Willemijn completely agrees.  
**[0:45:11-0:45:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:45:11):**  And I think there's another subject I wanted to briefly introduce.  
**[0:45:14-0:45:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:45:14):**  But Hannes, maybe you can join us and Willemijn as well.  
**[0:45:20-0:45:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:45:20):**  If you are there.  
**[0:45:23-0:45:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:45:23):**  Hello, Hannes.  
**[0:45:26-0:45:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:45:26):**  No audio for Hannes, I think.  
**[0:45:28-0:45:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:45:28):**  Willemijn, are you available?  
**[0:45:29-0:45:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:45:29):**  Yeah, I'm hiding behind my camera.  
**[0:45:33-0:45:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:45:33):**  Yeah, so because we're seeing that, you know, after a few years, you have a larger network  
**[0:45:41-0:45:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:45:41):**  of farmers that you're cooperating with, supporting, and there's more and more sort of data being  
**[0:45:45-0:45:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:45:45):**  gathered as you restore the soil, as you apply more practices.  
**[0:45:51-0:45:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:45:51):**  So we're working on developing, yeah, basically information systems for together with farming  
**[0:45:57-0:46:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:45:57):**  networks to understand how this data evolves over time and how that can be used as a proof  
**[0:46:03-0:46:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:46:03):**  for payments.  
**[0:46:06-0:46:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:46:06):**  But so we consciously stay away from sort of large tech giants to build these systems.  
**[0:46:13-0:46:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:46:13):**  But how do you yeah, it's just we haven't found we're not we don't feel like we're knowledgeable  
**[0:46:18-0:46:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:46:18):**  enough to understand which decisions we're making and what the effects are in the long  
**[0:46:22-0:46:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:46:22):**  run for farmers for land users.  
**[0:46:25-0:46:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:46:25):**  Of course, we can follow the GDPR guidelines.  
**[0:46:30-0:46:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:46:30):**  But this is bigger, I feel like this is land data and land use data.  
**[0:46:35-0:46:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:46:35):**  And how do you secure that in a way where farmers can always withdraw whenever they  
**[0:46:40-0:46:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:46:40):**  want to and that it's not misused?  
**[0:46:43-0:46:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:46:43):**  Or I just wonder if there are good resources or organizations thinking about this.  
**[0:46:50-0:46:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:46:50):**  Because I feel like data is like a new form of commons and it needs to be protected.  
**[0:46:59-0:47:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:46:59):**  Yeah.  
**[0:47:01-0:47:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:47:01):**  Or organized well, basically.  
**[0:47:03-0:47:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:47:03):**  Yeah.  
**[0:47:04-0:47:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:47:04):**  Yeah.  
**[0:47:05-0:47:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:47:05):**  Thank you, Willemijn.  
**[0:47:06-0:47:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:47:06):**  Hannes is also asking a question in the chat.  
**[0:47:09-0:47:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:47:09):**  You probably can join us.  
**[0:47:10-0:47:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:47:10):**  But the thing I wanted to extend upon, maybe as a final remark a little bit, it's something  
**[0:47:16-0:47:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:47:16):**  you reached out or you shared after the last conversation of Kronvo, a subject that you  
**[0:47:22-0:47:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:47:22):**  would like to introduce as well, that would just give some space for to introduce maybe.  
**[0:47:26-0:47:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:47:26):**  And I know Hannes is familiar with both areas.  
**[0:47:30-0:47:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:47:30):**  It's about agroecology.  
**[0:47:31-0:47:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:47:31):**  Can you share a little bit about your thoughts there?  
**[0:47:35-0:47:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:47:35):**  Yeah, so I realized that regenerative agriculture was sort of not back.  
**[0:47:42-0:47:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:47:42):**  So there's not enough peer reviewed science backing regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:47:46-0:47:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:47:46):**  So it is increasing, but it's still not competing with the research backing conventional agriculture,  
**[0:47:51-0:47:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:47:51):**  right?  
**[0:47:52-0:47:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:47:52):**  So both in terms of resources going towards it and the research resulting out of it.  
**[0:47:57-0:48:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:47:57):**  So I was thinking, so if agroecology is more established and has more scientific research  
**[0:48:03-0:48:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:48:03):**  backing it up, could that then be a better opening in terms of transitioning the food  
**[0:48:09-0:48:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:48:09):**  system because it's more established?  
**[0:48:12-0:48:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:48:12):**  But then I also understand diving a little bit into agroecology movement, it's really  
**[0:48:17-0:48:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:48:17):**  beautiful and it's also very much connected to social justice.  
**[0:48:21-0:48:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:48:21):**  And it's originated largely from Latin America, but it's also a bit more activist.  
**[0:48:28-0:48:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:48:28):**  So collaborating with large corporates is almost not done in that kind of movement.  
**[0:48:33-0:48:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:48:33):**  So I was just an open question, like how can regenerative agriculture and agroecology,  
**[0:48:40-0:48:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:48:40):**  how do they relate to each other?  
**[0:48:42-0:48:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:48:42):**  How can they reinforce each other?  
**[0:48:45-0:48:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:48:45):**  Connecting movements basically.  
**[0:48:48-0:48:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:48:48):**  Sometimes it's the same people doing just totally differently depending on where they  
**[0:48:53-0:48:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:48:53):**  are.  
**[0:48:54-0:48:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:48:54):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:48:55-0:49:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:48:55):**  And even the wording can attract a specific group while maybe different groups are actually  
**[0:49:02-0:49:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:49:02):**  working on the same thing, which I think is hard.  
**[0:49:04-0:49:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:49:04):**  For example, I think regenerative agriculture, the term is especially popular in Northern  
**[0:49:11-0:49:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:49:11):**  America, probably Australia, even less so in Europe, probably.  
**[0:49:16-0:49:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:49:16):**  The thing to add is that we did a bit of a scanning of policy documents, especially European  
**[0:49:22-0:49:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:49:22):**  and United Nations level documents to see which agricultural term is popular.  
**[0:49:28-0:49:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:49:28):**  Region ag was almost never mentioned, but agroecology was, or sustainable agriculture.  
**[0:49:36-0:49:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:49:36):**  So that was a good eye opener for us to see, who, OK, so region ag is not, you know, that  
**[0:49:42-0:49:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:49:42):**  term doesn't ring bells in the policy environment, especially in Europe.  
**[0:49:47-0:49:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:49:47):**  Yeah.  
**[0:49:48-0:49:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:49:48):**  Yeah.  
**[0:49:49-0:49:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:49:49):**  All right.  
**[0:49:50-0:49:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:49:50):**  Well, I think Anders isn't able to do so, but maybe for a later moment or even you can  
**[0:49:55-0:49:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:49:55):**  connect directly.  
**[0:49:56-0:50:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:49:56):**  He's been involved quite actively in agroecology movement and now in region ag more and more.  
**[0:50:02-0:50:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:50:02):**  So he's sort of emerged in both worlds and seen the cultural differences as well.  
**[0:50:07-0:50:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:50:07):**  And maybe sees a potential, maybe I can make the connection.  
**[0:50:11-0:50:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:50:11):**  But for now, we're also reaching the end, I think, Koen, if I agree.  
**[0:50:18-0:50:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:50:18):**  So it might be time for maybe some last thoughts you had on this session and then we need to  
**[0:50:25-0:50:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:50:25):**  wrap it up, I think.  
**[0:50:28-0:50:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:50:28):**  Not too much, I think, as always, we only scratched the surface.  
**[0:50:31-0:50:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:50:31):**  So we find it definitely intended.  
**[0:50:34-0:50:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:50:34):**  There's so much to explore here from the naming, the language to the technology side of things  
**[0:50:39-0:50:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:50:39):**  and the finance side of things.  
**[0:50:41-0:50:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:50:41):**  So on to the next one.  
**[0:50:44-0:50:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:50:44):**  Yeah.  
**[0:50:45-0:50:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:50:45):**  All right.  
**[0:50:46-0:50:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:50:46):**  Thank you, everyone, for coming in.  
**[0:50:47-0:50:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:50:47):**  We'll probably do another one next month as well.  
**[0:50:51-0:50:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:50:51):**  We still need to pick the date with Koen, but we'll probably do that.  
**[0:50:56-0:51:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:50:56):**  As said, we are actively looking for participants in our programs for people that want to make  
**[0:51:01-0:51:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:51:01):**  a jump in building an organization in the regenerative space.  
**[0:51:07-0:51:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:51:07):**  So very open to do so.  
**[0:51:10-0:51:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:51:10):**  If you have subjects that you want to make more prominent in the next conversation or  
**[0:51:14-0:51:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:51:14):**  you want to get involved on a subject in any other way, please do reach out and we'll try  
**[0:51:19-0:51:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:51:19):**  to create the stage for that conversation.  
**[0:51:22-0:51:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:51:22):**  So thanks again, everyone, for joining and hope to see you next time.  
**[0:51:27-0:51:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:51:27):**  Bye bye.  
**[0:51:29-0:51:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:51:29):**  Thank you.  
**[0:51:32-0:51:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:51:32):**  Thank you, everyone.  
**[0:51:40-0:51:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:51:40):**  All right.  
**[0:51:50-0:51:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:51:50):**  Cool.  
**[0:51:54-0:52:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:51:54):**  Dear friends of the podcast, I'm super excited to share with you the online video course  
**[0:52:04-0:52:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:52:04):**  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  
**[0:52:08-0:52:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:52:08):**  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  
**[0:52:12-0:52:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:52:12):**  Why are we doing this course?  
**[0:52:14-0:52:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:52:14):**  After 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question how to put money  
**[0:52:18-0:52:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:52:18):**  to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011 and recording  
**[0:52:23-0:52:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:52:23):**  this podcast since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  
**[0:52:28-0:52:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:52:28):**  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  
**[0:52:30-0:52:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:52:30):**  How have we built our decision making framework?  
**[0:52:33-0:52:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:52:33):**  What to focus on with the podcast?  
**[0:52:35-0:52:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:52:35):**  How have we picked interviewees and what questions should you ask?  
**[0:52:39-0:52:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:52:39):**  What is happening in the space?  
**[0:52:40-0:52:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:52:40):**  What should you read?  
**[0:52:41-0:52:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:52:41):**  What should you listen?  
**[0:52:43-0:52:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:52:43):**  What should you watch?  
**[0:52:44-0:52:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:52:44):**  How to approach this space?  
**[0:52:46-0:52:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:52:46):**  For whom is this course?  
**[0:52:48-0:52:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:52:48):**  You the soil builders and investors in the space, the soil builders, people working in  
**[0:52:52-0:52:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:52:52):**  this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers, vehicle builders, crowd investing,  
**[0:52:57-0:53:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:52:57):**  platform builders, ag tech companies, farm to gut food companies, permaculture, key line  
**[0:53:02-0:53:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:53:02):**  designers, holistic management, consultants, etc. etc.  
**[0:53:05-0:53:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:53:05):**  People that are building soil at scale.  
**[0:53:08-0:53:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:53:08):**  And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office  
**[0:53:11-0:53:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:53:11):**  or as private individuals or people who are putting other people's money to work through  
**[0:53:15-0:53:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:53:15):**  foundations, institutional capital, banks, insurance companies, etc.  
**[0:53:20-0:53:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:53:20):**  Is this course free?  
**[0:53:21-0:53:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:53:21):**  No.  
**[0:53:22-0:53:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:53:22):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  
**[0:53:25-0:53:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:53:25):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you and I'm very aware  
**[0:53:30-0:53:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:53:30):**  that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very different means.  
**[0:53:34-0:53:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:53:34):**  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  
**[0:53:39-0:53:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:53:39):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.  
**[0:53:42-0:53:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:53:42):**  Thank you.  
**[0:53:43-0:53:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:53:43):**  So what is this course?  
**[0:53:44-0:53:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:53:44):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  
**[0:53:51-0:53:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:53:51):**  so you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:53:53-0:53:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:53:53):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:53:58-0:54:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:53:58):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:54:03-0:54:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:54:03):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[0:54:08-0:54:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:54:08):**  if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:54:09-0:54:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:54:09):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:54:14-0:54:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:54:14):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:54:18-0:54:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:54:18):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:54:23-0:54:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:54:23):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:54:24-0:54:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:54:24):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:54:26-0:54:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:54:26):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:54:28-0:54:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:54:28):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:54:32-0:54:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:54:32):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:54:34-0:54:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:54:34):**  Before making any investment please find professional investment advice.  
**[0:54:39-0:54:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:54:39):**  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking.

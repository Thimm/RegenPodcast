**[0:00:21-0:00:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:00:21):**  which has raised 800 million across two funds for permanent crops in the last 6 years.  
**[0:00:26-0:00:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:00:26):**  How do they think about the future and how would they structure the ideal regenerative

**[0:01:25-0:01:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:01:25):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:27-0:01:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:01:27):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:31-0:01:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:01:31):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:01:33):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:38-0:01:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:01:38):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.

**[0:02:17-0:02:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:02:17):**  planet and the communities in which they operate.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:02:20):**  They are focused on bringing the needed scale to the regenerative food production.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:02:24):**  Welcome Woot Turner and Atish Badu.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:02:26):**  Hi there.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:02:27):**  Hi.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:02:28):**  And to start with a personal question, what brings you to soil and regenerative agriculture?  
**[0:02:32-0:02:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:02:32):**  Well, for me, it's a long standing belief that agriculture is an essential part of how  
**[0:02:38-0:02:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:02:38):**  we live and how we live on the planet, frankly, and the need to produce food sustainably,  
**[0:02:44-0:02:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:02:44):**  regeneratively, responsibly has never been greater than it is today.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:02:49):**  As populations continue to grow and pressures on our food system, pressures on our transportation  
**[0:02:54-0:02:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:02:54):**  system, pressures on how we do business and how we live continue to increase, doing this  
**[0:02:59-0:03:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:02:59):**  the right way is absolutely essential.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:03:00):**  And so this for me started at a very young age and has only amplified in the last several  
**[0:03:07-0:03:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:03:07):**  years.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:03:08):**  We obviously believe at Agriculture Capital that the role of perennial agriculture and  
**[0:03:12-0:03:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:03:12):**  permanent crop agriculture in helping reduce atmospheric carbon and sequester significant  
**[0:03:18-0:03:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:03:18):**  amounts of carbon in the soil and in plant material and conservation areas is a huge  
**[0:03:24-0:03:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:03:24):**  opportunity and that's a big driver for us.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:03:27):**  But obviously the most important thing if you're in the food world as we are, is the  
**[0:03:32-0:03:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:03:32):**  connection between soil and high quality food.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:03:36):**  If we're not spending time building soil health and creating a living soil structure, we're  
**[0:03:42-0:03:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:03:42):**  going to be very unhappy with the food that we're trying to produce.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:03:45):**  Atish, I'd love to hear your thoughts.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:03:47):**  Yeah, I think I approach the challenge of soil health a little bit differently.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:03:52):**  My interests stem probably more from looking at climate change solutions.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:03:58):**  And I started my career very much in kind of the opposite end of the spectrum, more  
**[0:04:03-0:04:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:04:03):**  tech and tech finance and early in my career, I got very interested in climate change and  
**[0:04:10-0:04:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:04:10):**  climate change solutions.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:04:12):**  Very quickly, that kind of exploration led to agriculture's role in climate change.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:04:20):**  And kind of in turn, I thought one of the best ways, the most interesting ways to start  
**[0:04:25-0:04:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:04:25):**  addressing climate change is affecting ag and affecting soil health and carbon sequestration  
**[0:04:33-0:04:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:04:33):**  through the ag supply chain, especially starting with the soil farm.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:04:37):**  So while everything that Wood said is incorrect in terms of the food that we want to eat and  
**[0:04:44-0:04:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:04:44):**  consume and the effects on the environment, I think I would add the statement, if we want  
**[0:04:49-0:04:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:04:49):**  a food supply chain that is also more oriented to helping abate climate change issues, you  
**[0:04:57-0:05:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:04:57):**  quickly get to soil health agronomy practices as two big levers of possible change.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:05:04):**  And that's, I mean, you said, I think twice in that sentence, you quickly get to soil  
**[0:05:09-0:05:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:05:09):**  health, etc.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:05:10):**  I mean, that interest is growing, but I still see many people not making that connection.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:05:15):**  What triggered that connection for you, as many other people, rightfully so, go into  
**[0:05:18-0:05:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:05:18):**  solar, go into distributed energy, go into, etc., etc.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:05:24):**  What made you see soil as a carbon sink and trees as a permanent crop as a carbon sink,  
**[0:05:28-0:05:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:05:28):**  etc.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:05:29):**  Which is quite a step from technical world.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:05:31):**  It is indeed.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:05:32):**  Looking kind of at root causes, right?  
**[0:05:34-0:05:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:05:34):**  So if you start with carbon emissions, you very quickly get to agriculture is the second  
**[0:05:40-0:05:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:05:40):**  biggest carbon emitter in the world following oil and gas.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:05:46):**  And then when you start thinking about agriculture and how to affect change and looking at some  
**[0:05:53-0:06:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:05:53):**  of the primary causes, you realize a lot of the both problems and opportunities around  
**[0:06:01-0:06:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:06:01):**  agricultural role in climate change has to do with soil and how we treat and manage that  
**[0:06:06-0:06:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:06:06):**  soil.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:06:07):**  And I think the thing that is missing as of yet is clear market mechanisms and signals  
**[0:06:13-0:06:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:06:13):**  that tie these together.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:06:14):**  So it isn't necessarily obvious, but there isn't necessarily market mechanisms that put  
**[0:06:20-0:06:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:06:20):**  all of these pieces together.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:06:22):**  But therein lies a bit of a bet in terms of the long term opportunity that is ahead of  
**[0:06:26-0:06:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:06:26):**  that capital.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:06:27):**  I was just going to add that I think another way you might take this conversation is that  
**[0:06:32-0:06:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:06:32):**  there's a lot of people that are trying to figure out how to produce as much food as  
**[0:06:35-0:06:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:06:35):**  we possibly can to meet the growing needs of a growing planet.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:06:39):**  And a lot of those solutions are landing in kind of vertical agriculture and indoor agriculture.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:06:45):**  And I'm not going to sit here and be so parochial to assume that the only way to actually do  
**[0:06:49-0:06:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:06:49):**  what we need to do is by growing fruits and nuts in the ground and building soil.  
**[0:06:54-0:06:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:06:54):**  But you'll be in the right community.  
**[0:06:56-0:06:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:06:56):**  I do fundamentally believe that.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:06:58):**  And I do think there's going to be a role for other types of food production.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:07:02):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:07:03):**  And I'm not denigrating those in any way at all.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:07:06):**  But I fundamentally believe that the core of responsible agriculture and certainly regenerative  
**[0:07:10-0:07:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:07:10):**  agriculture is growing food in the soil, is a land management philosophy.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:07:16):**  How do we expand responsible practices across as much acreage as we possibly can in food  
**[0:07:22-0:07:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:07:22):**  production in order to have the biggest impact on how we manage land and the impact that  
**[0:07:27-0:07:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:07:27):**  how we manage that land has on the climate, has on water resources and so on.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:07:32):**  So I just want to reinforce that I do believe there's something about soil that to me is  
**[0:07:36-0:07:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:07:36):**  fundamental about food.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:07:37):**  No, I agree.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:07:38):**  And I think there's Victor Friedberg said it nicely that something I'm for sure quoting  
**[0:07:44-0:07:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:07:44):**  it wrong, but something I don't see a future where we're feeding nine or 10 billion people  
**[0:07:48-0:07:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:07:48):**  where soil isn't an important part of the solution, not meaning it's the only part.  
**[0:07:53-0:07:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:07:53):**  And I strongly believe there's going to be pieces of vertically farming.  
**[0:07:56-0:07:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:07:56):**  There are going to be pieces of.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:07:58):**  But if you look at the crops we currently farm there or the crops you currently get  
**[0:08:02-0:08:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:08:02):**  out of those systems, and if you look at the true input and output costs, it's still tricky.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:08:07):**  Let's say the least.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:08:08):**  It's not an ideal yet.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:08:09):**  And it might increase because we get much more efficient LEDs, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:08:14):**  But if you look at the impact you want to have or we want to have in terms of climate  
**[0:08:17-0:08:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:08:17):**  and water and also quantity of food, you need to think about a lot of acres or a lot of  
**[0:08:22-0:08:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:08:22):**  hectares wherever you are.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:08:24):**  And that means you're going to get into tree cropping means you get into broad acre farm.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:08:28):**  You need to touch a lot of hectares to make a difference because at the end of the day,  
**[0:08:33-0:08:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:08:33):**  we need to store a lot of carbon and a lot of water.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:08:35):**  So I try to focus at least this podcast as much as possible on where the acres and hectares  
**[0:08:40-0:08:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:08:40):**  are.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:08:41):**  And that comes down to a small number of crops, unfortunately, but we're definitely trying  
**[0:08:45-0:08:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:08:45):**  to increase the complexity of that.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:08:48):**  So could you give a short overview?  
**[0:08:50-0:08:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:08:50):**  We've mentioned agriculture capital a few times.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:08:52):**  I entered it.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:08:53):**  Where are you now?  
**[0:08:54-0:08:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:08:54):**  Just a short glance of what agriculture capital is at the moment.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:08:58):**  We're talking April 2020.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:09:01):**  So agriculture capital in 2020, we managed about 20,000 acres of citrus, blueberries,  
**[0:09:09-0:09:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:09:09):**  table grapes and hazelnuts on the west coast of the US in Australia, the Murray River,  
**[0:09:17-0:09:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:09:17):**  sorry, Murray-Darling River Basin.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:09:19):**  We're about 18,000 in the US and 2000 in Australia.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:09:24):**  We currently have a team of 30 investment professionals.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:09:28):**  In addition to the 30 investment professionals, we have about 400 full-time employees between  
**[0:09:35-0:09:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:09:35):**  California, Oregon, Washington state and Australia, both managing our farms as well as the associated  
**[0:09:44-0:09:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:09:44):**  hacking and processing assets that we have acquired and built as part of those farm operations.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:09:52):**  Today we are really focused on a strategy where we're growing in those crop areas, foods  
**[0:09:59-0:10:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:09:59):**  that people want and increasingly are desiring more fresh and more convenient foods, doing  
**[0:10:06-0:10:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:10:06):**  so in scale, vertically integrating between farm and I'll call it primary processing and  
**[0:10:13-0:10:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:10:13):**  managing the operations in a regenerative way.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:10:16):**  In terms of the publicly available information, in terms of our investment program, we have  
**[0:10:22-0:10:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:10:22):**  $800 million US between two funds.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:10:26):**  The first fund was a $250 million fund that was raised in 2014.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:10:32):**  And our second fund is a $550 million US fund that was raised in 2016.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:10:39):**  We're currently investing out of that second fund.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:10:42):**  I would add to that, I think it's been an interesting several years.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:10:46):**  Ateisha and I were early parts of the team around the time that our first fund was coming  
**[0:10:52-0:10:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:10:52):**  to a reality.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:10:53):**  And we now have five plus years of track record with that first fund and then right behind  
**[0:10:59-0:11:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:10:59):**  that with the second fund to really begin to see kind of where the biggest opportunities  
**[0:11:04-0:11:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:11:04):**  for impact are for us on the regenerative side of things.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:11:07):**  It's allowed us, I think to be, we were a little bit in the wilderness, if you will,  
**[0:11:11-0:11:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:11:11):**  five or six years ago in trying to advance the conversation with a certain type of investor  
**[0:11:16-0:11:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:11:16):**  about what role regenerative practices could play potentially in the performance of our  
**[0:11:21-0:11:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:11:21):**  business over time.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:11:22):**  And now we're beginning to see kind of what those opportunities might look like.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:11:26):**  And not all the answers are clear, but we're seeing significant increases across the portfolio  
**[0:11:30-0:11:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:11:30):**  in terms of habitat conservation and some of the indicators associated with that.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:11:35):**  Some increases across the portfolio in soil or yaning matter as an indicator of soil health  
**[0:11:40-0:11:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:11:40):**  and other benefits that I think are really exciting.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:11:43):**  And we've been sort of trying to lean into the research on that to begin to sort of help  
**[0:11:48-0:11:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:11:48):**  others understand that, hey, there are ecosystem services associated with a lot of these practices  
**[0:11:53-0:11:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:11:53):**  that we are actively contributing to and actively beginning to see real economics that we can  
**[0:11:59-0:12:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:11:59):**  begin to report on.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:12:00):**  And I think that's been an important part of what we're doing.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:12:02):**  In no way is it complete, in no way is it perfect, but it is, and I think we continue  
**[0:12:06-0:12:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:12:06):**  to hear this from others.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:12:07):**  It raises the bar for the rest.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:12:08):**  It raises the bar.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:12:09):**  We are pushing this conversation in a way that many others haven't been able to at this  
**[0:12:14-0:12:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:12:14):**  point, and I get really excited about that.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:12:16):**  At the same time, I may be anticipating a question you're going to ask is sort of what  
**[0:12:20-0:12:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:12:20):**  are some of the barriers to getting this done?  
**[0:12:22-0:12:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:12:22):**  And I think, and Atish can certainly speak to this, but I think, you know, we have the  
**[0:12:26-0:12:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:12:26):**  ability in our two funds to manage resources from our investors, manage capital from our  
**[0:12:30-0:12:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:12:30):**  investors over a short period of time, over a 10-year period of time.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:12:35):**  Is that enough time to be able to enhance the value of our soil, enhance the value of  
**[0:12:41-0:12:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:12:41):**  our landscapes through regenerative practices?  
**[0:12:45-0:12:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:12:45):**  And we have this conversation as a team all the time.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:12:47):**  Atish and I certainly have it together, but we have it with our teammates all the time,  
**[0:12:50-0:12:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:12:50):**  our colleagues all the time.  
**[0:12:52-0:12:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:12:52):**  And I think the answer is no, it's not enough time.  
**[0:12:54-0:12:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:12:54):**  I mean, I come from businesses that I've been with before joining this team where you're  
**[0:12:58-0:13:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:12:58):**  enhancing value through sustainability, through regenerative practices over 25, 30 years of  
**[0:13:04-0:13:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:13:04):**  engagement.  
**[0:13:05-0:13:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:13:05):**  And I still fundamentally believe that.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:13:07):**  I believe that long stewardship is absolutely essential to sort of really seeing the value  
**[0:13:11-0:13:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:13:11):**  that can come from these kinds of practices.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:13:13):**  I'll also tell you that I think it's fun and challenging to try to figure out what a more  
**[0:13:18-0:13:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:13:18):**  short term snap I could look like.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:13:21):**  Of course, because you were able to raise this 800 million because of the 10-year, because  
**[0:13:26-0:13:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:13:26):**  of the classical fund structure, because I don't want to assume anything, but I'm imagining  
**[0:13:31-0:13:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:13:31):**  many of the institutional investors wouldn't have jumped on board if you would have presented  
**[0:13:35-0:13:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:13:35):**  a not typical structure because you were already atypical on the agriculture side.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:13:40):**  And if you look, I will definitely link it below at your impact report, it's very detailed  
**[0:13:46-0:13:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:13:46):**  on soil organic matter.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:13:47):**  Like you measure that and you report on that on most farms on a farm level, which is something  
**[0:13:52-0:13:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:13:52):**  that I don't think most institutional investors have ever seen, especially a number of years  
**[0:13:55-0:13:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:13:55):**  ago.  
**[0:13:56-0:14:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:13:56):**  So it's that constant dance, which I would love to dive deeper into between what you're  
**[0:14:01-0:14:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:14:01):**  part of your clients, which are obviously the customers that buy your food, which are  
**[0:14:05-0:14:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:14:05):**  moving at a certain pace and your other clients are the institutional investors.  
**[0:14:09-0:14:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:14:09):**  Have you seen a change there in terms of as you are approaching that third fund and maybe  
**[0:14:15-0:14:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:14:15):**  even with the second fund already, have you seen something that's moving there that maybe  
**[0:14:20-0:14:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:14:20):**  gives you hope that that 10-year maybe is not a fixed thing that we might be able to  
**[0:14:23-0:14:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:14:23):**  change that because I think a lot of people will be listening and are thinking, yeah,  
**[0:14:27-0:14:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:14:27):**  I know it's not enough time.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:14:28):**  Like it would be ideal.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:14:29):**  Yeah.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:14:30):**  And you hit the nail on the head.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:14:32):**  The 10-year fund structure is, well, let's say we're always trying to work to better  
**[0:14:38-0:14:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:14:38):**  align duration of the assets with an investment vehicle and the structure, as well as with  
**[0:14:46-0:14:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:14:46):**  how we create value from an operational standpoint.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:14:49):**  And a lot of that value, especially if you extend the time horizon, is embedded in the  
**[0:14:55-0:14:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:14:55):**  regenerative practices.  
**[0:14:56-0:15:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:14:56):**  And when we say value, that's not only profit maximization or profit enhancement, but it's  
**[0:15:01-0:15:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:15:01):**  also risk reduction.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:15:03):**  So I think what we try to do is let's go back to first principles around the assets.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:15:09):**  So these are trees that if managed properly on farms could have lifetimes of several decades  
**[0:15:16-0:15:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:15:16):**  and in some cases, centuries.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:15:18):**  We have certain citrus trees that we're currently managing that are over 100 years old in California.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:15:25):**  And so when you think about that type of timeframe or timescale, the issues that really keep  
**[0:15:31-0:15:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:15:31):**  you up over that period of time, hopefully not every night because there's a long, long  
**[0:15:36-0:15:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:15:36):**  time to stay up.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:15:37):**  But the issues that worry folks are not what's happening with the market this year or what's  
**[0:15:43-0:15:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:15:43):**  happening in terms of trade or supply chains at any particular point in time.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:15:50):**  It's what could systematically or systemically affect the health and the productivity of  
**[0:15:56-0:16:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:15:56):**  this asset for a long period of time or over that period of time.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:16:00):**  And not surprisingly, the big concerns and risk on that front tend to be environmental  
**[0:16:06-0:16:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:16:06):**  and tend to be social implications in the communities that we deal with.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:16:11):**  But on the environmental front, it's things like drought, water, climate change, soil  
**[0:16:17-0:16:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:16:17):**  health, soil productivity, soil health being a proxy of soil productivity or farm productivity.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:16:26):**  And so when we started, the regenerative page in our presentation or publications to investors  
**[0:16:33-0:16:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:16:33):**  was always the second to last page.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:16:36):**  And now it's actually the second page.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:16:38):**  The first page is being kind of a quick intro.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:16:41):**  And so within a period of six years, we've seen a sea change in thinking.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:16:45):**  And I think that's happening for a couple of reasons.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:16:48):**  So one, I think you just have, I think one, it happens to kind of align with just greater  
**[0:16:54-0:17:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:16:54):**  risks being realized in other portfolios, whether it be climate change, water scarcity,  
**[0:17:01-0:17:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:17:01):**  labor availability.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:17:02):**  These issues increasingly are popping up in companies reporting to investors.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:17:10):**  Somewhat, you know, chicken and egg, right, which came first, the companies reporting  
**[0:17:14-0:17:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:17:14):**  that or the people asking the companies to report on it.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:17:17):**  But increasingly, you're seeing more demands for transparency and for ESG stewardship or  
**[0:17:25-0:17:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:17:25):**  regenerative stewardship, depending on the sector you're talking about, from investors,  
**[0:17:30-0:17:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:17:30):**  from the consumers.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:17:31):**  So I think that's all enhanced the call to action to try to address those issues.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:17:39):**  And so for our investors, what they're realizing is that a lot of the operational value that  
**[0:17:45-0:17:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:17:45):**  we can create in terms of regenerative opportunities have very high paybacks.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:17:50):**  But 10 years is oftentimes not enough time for that to commercially pencil.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:17:57):**  And if you think about assets that are going to live several decades at a minimum, why  
**[0:18:02-0:18:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:18:02):**  are you underwriting for two years or five years or 10 years?  
**[0:18:05-0:18:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:18:05):**  Why is that the horizon?  
**[0:18:06-0:18:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:18:06):**  If you were to, if you were to building or a bridge or a house, you certainly wouldn't  
**[0:18:11-0:18:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:18:11):**  look at the improvements or how you built it just simply due to an arbitrary two or  
**[0:18:17-0:18:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:18:17):**  five or 10 year period of time.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:18:19):**  I'm saying if you were building it yourself, right.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:18:21):**  And so I think increasingly, investors are open minded about some type of evergreen or  
**[0:18:26-0:18:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:18:26):**  perpetual vehicle.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:18:28):**  We have, I think, to our credit, done a good job of talking about it since the very beginning  
**[0:18:34-0:18:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:18:34):**  of AC.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:18:35):**  Even during our first fundraise, we talked about these issues very openly.  
**[0:18:41-0:18:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:18:41):**  And our perspective was a little bit counterintuitive in that.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:18:44):**  So you prep the mines while selling a 10 year fund?  
**[0:18:48-0:18:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:18:48):**  Not only prep the mines, but we were really looking for alignments.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:18:52):**  And we weren't necessarily afraid to lose someone if there wasn't alignment.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:18:57):**  So we perhaps at a period where we believed we were operating in a mode of abundance and  
**[0:19:03-0:19:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:19:03):**  capital wasn't the scarcity that was the limiting constraint, we were really looking and filtering  
**[0:19:09-0:19:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:19:09):**  for investors that had a long term view and had that insight that there was this opportunity  
**[0:19:15-0:19:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:19:15):**  to possibly pursue over time.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:19:18):**  And so over six years, we've kind of cultivated a large database of investors who are least  
**[0:19:25-0:19:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:19:25):**  open minded about thinking about underwriting and looking at investments with that long  
**[0:19:31-0:19:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:19:31):**  term horizon.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:19:32):**  The key for us is still proving to them that not only is there an ESG reason for this to  
**[0:19:39-0:19:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:19:39):**  be undertaken, but that there are financial incentives as well as risk management incentives  
**[0:19:44-0:19:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:19:44):**  to do so.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:19:45):**  So another way to think about it is we told them we were going to do it or we were contemplating  
**[0:19:51-0:19:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:19:51):**  it and we have to win their trust and build their confidence in us.  
**[0:19:54-0:19:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:19:54):**  And I think over time, we're going to continue to push on this.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:19:59):**  And hopefully one day we can probably not in the too distant future, we'll be able to  
**[0:20:04-0:20:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:20:04):**  better align fund structure and fund duration or term with the activities that we think  
**[0:20:10-0:20:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:20:10):**  are critical for value creation and better aligned to the underlying assets that make  
**[0:20:15-0:20:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:20:15):**  up our investments.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:20:16):**  I do think that Atish said something, alluded to something in his comments there that I  
**[0:20:21-0:20:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:20:21):**  want to just reinforce.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:20:23):**  And it's really this idea of resilience.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:20:25):**  And I do think this particular moment, Cohen, is interesting for all of us for so many reasons.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:20:30):**  I don't want to date your podcast by talking about the fact that this is April 20th.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:20:36):**  We feel like we're seeing some evidence to suggest that the kind of business that we've  
**[0:20:43-0:20:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:20:43):**  developed, the kind of business that we've been able to grow with the support of our  
**[0:20:46-0:20:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:20:46):**  investors has built into it some degree of resilience for moments like this, where we  
**[0:20:51-0:20:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:20:51):**  actually can manage a full value chain.  
**[0:20:55-0:21:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:20:55):**  We can put protocols in place to ensure a high level of employee safety and food safety  
**[0:21:01-0:21:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:21:01):**  in the context of what we're providing, not just one moment in time in the value chain  
**[0:21:05-0:21:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:21:05):**  or one moment in time in the supply chain, but more of a chain of custody, if you will.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:21:08):**  And that to me is resilience.  
**[0:21:11-0:21:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:21:11):**  And if I have to think about the COVID-19 moment as an analog to anything, I can see  
**[0:21:17-0:21:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:21:17):**  that same kind of resilience being part of what we're trying to do on the climate side  
**[0:21:21-0:21:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:21:21):**  as well.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:21:22):**  Are we investing in wild pollinator conservation?  
**[0:21:25-0:21:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:21:25):**  Yes, for a variety of reasons.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:21:27):**  One is that we believe it can enhance returns.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:21:29):**  One is that we believe it can resonate with consumers.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:21:32):**  But we also believe that in a world that has more impact from climate change on pollinators,  
**[0:21:38-0:21:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:21:38):**  we want to have the most resilient, most adaptive pollinators helping support our business as  
**[0:21:43-0:21:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:21:43):**  we possibly can.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:21:44):**  So I do think that there's something illustrative about this particular moment and what it says  
**[0:21:50-0:21:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:21:50):**  about our resilience that I think is consistent with what we're trying to do on climate or  
**[0:21:55-0:21:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:21:55):**  water.  
**[0:21:56-0:22:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:21:56):**  I mean, the idea of trying to build up soil organic matter as a means of retaining more  
**[0:22:00-0:22:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:22:00):**  water on our farms, for example, as a storage mechanism, frankly, by building our own storage  
**[0:22:05-0:22:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:22:05):**  for water on our farms as a way of having access to that water when it is available.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:22:10):**  I mean, there's a misalignment in California, for example, when there's a lot of water in  
**[0:22:15-0:22:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:22:15):**  December and January, that's not when you need it.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:22:18):**  We need it six or seven months later.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:22:20):**  So building into that business, the ability to impound that water and use it later is  
**[0:22:24-0:22:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:22:24):**  an important part of that.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:22:25):**  Whether that's done through ecosystem services or done through a piece of infrastructure,  
**[0:22:31-0:22:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:22:31):**  it's all part of the same equation.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:22:32):**  But I just wanted to say, I think that resilience piece, from where I sit, leading our impact  
**[0:22:37-0:22:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:22:37):**  efforts, I do believe that resilience is resonating broadly.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:22:41):**  I think we're seeing, and obviously it depends when you're listening to this and where, we're  
**[0:22:46-0:22:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:22:46):**  seeing the focus or suddenly the attention that we always obviously had in our bubble  
**[0:22:51-0:22:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:22:51):**  on local food systems and on real food systems.  
**[0:22:54-0:22:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:22:54):**  And suddenly the rest of the world saw for the first time in their lives an empty shelf  
**[0:22:58-0:23:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:22:58):**  in a supermarket, or maybe not for the first time, obviously, again, where you live, but  
**[0:23:02-0:23:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:23:02):**  at least in the, we say the Western world, people suddenly realize that eggs don't come  
**[0:23:08-0:23:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:23:08):**  from the supermarket and started looking at, okay, who do I know that produces food, which  
**[0:23:13-0:23:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:23:13):**  farms locally?  
**[0:23:14-0:23:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:23:14):**  I know quite a few that have a waiting list of thousands now and that until, let's say,  
**[0:23:20-0:23:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:23:20):**  February were struggling for different reasons.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:23:24):**  Now they're struggling for other reasons.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:23:25):**  So it's a very interesting point in terms of resilient food systems and regenerative  
**[0:23:28-0:23:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:23:28):**  food systems.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:23:29):**  And of course we have to see how sticky is this, but it's definitely, I think part of  
**[0:23:34-0:23:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:23:34):**  this attention will stay.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:23:35):**  There's no way we all go back to the same mindlessness buying and not understanding  
**[0:23:39-0:23:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:23:39):**  where it comes from.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:23:40):**  And I think the risks that come with the food system are also getting pinnifully clear as  
**[0:23:44-0:23:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:23:44):**  we have entered the natural world so far that we created a number, or we unleashed a number  
**[0:23:49-0:23:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:23:49):**  of things that simply brought the whole world to a standstill.  
**[0:23:53-0:23:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:23:53):**  So I actually wanted to go back to something you said, Atish, and you said in the maybe  
**[0:23:58-0:24:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:23:58):**  not near distant future, but somewhere in the future, we'll seek a structure that fits  
**[0:24:03-0:24:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:24:03):**  better with the impact and also the financial structure we would like to see.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:24:07):**  I mean, if we could dream for a second, how would that look like?  
**[0:24:10-0:24:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:24:10):**  What would be an ideal?  
**[0:24:11-0:24:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:24:11):**  If tomorrow morning we wake up and an ideal financial structure would exist, looking at  
**[0:24:16-0:24:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:24:16):**  your experience of raising 800 million and putting it to work is still in the process  
**[0:24:20-0:24:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:24:20):**  of doing that and all your experience with investors.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:24:23):**  What would an ideal structure for a second, what would that look like?  
**[0:24:26-0:24:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:24:26):**  Yeah.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:24:27):**  Let me maybe start just with level setting about kind of what's unique about this question  
**[0:24:33-0:24:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:24:33):**  for permanent crops.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:24:35):**  So the name already kind of hints at some of the unique natures when we plant a new  
**[0:24:41-0:24:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:24:41):**  tree.  
**[0:24:42-0:24:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:24:42):**  They don't move.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:24:43):**  Yeah.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:24:44):**  Well, in that if they're managed properly, they can be kind of permanent fixture of a  
**[0:24:48-0:24:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:24:48):**  farm or kind of a broader land management landscape.  
**[0:24:52-0:24:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:24:52):**  But the point being, if we plant a tree, it can take anywhere up to seven years for that  
**[0:24:58-0:25:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:24:58):**  tree to reach full maturity.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:25:01):**  So these are, think about it from a financial perspective, you're making a large initial  
**[0:25:07-0:25:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:25:07):**  developments investments with longterm future proceeds, right?  
**[0:25:13-0:25:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:25:13):**  And as much as it reaches maturity in year seven, most of the cashflow then comes after  
**[0:25:19-0:25:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:25:19):**  a 10 year period.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:25:21):**  And so from an ideal standpoint, I think a structure that is, I'll call it long lived  
**[0:25:28-0:25:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:25:28):**  in nature, if not evergreen, and that has defined on ramps and off ramps for investors  
**[0:25:36-0:25:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:25:36):**  to get in and get out and redefine periods of time.  
**[0:25:40-0:25:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:25:40):**  That way, you kind of satisfy, I'll call it three different set of stakeholders.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:25:47):**  There's probably more than the following three, but let's call it the natural lands and the  
**[0:25:52-0:26:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:25:52):**  greater kind of land management set of stakeholders in that you are better able to manage these  
**[0:26:00-0:26:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:26:00):**  assets and be stewards of these assets in a way that works within what nature kind of  
**[0:26:06-0:26:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:26:06):**  gives you and takes away from you from your incentive then kind of is to plan for the  
**[0:26:12-0:26:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:26:12):**  long term.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:26:13):**  So that's kind of what's called the natural stakeholders is one.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:26:17):**  The other set of stakeholders that the structure then benefits are kind of investors.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:26:22):**  The investors have the ability to continue to invest or continue to own these assets  
**[0:26:29-0:26:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:26:29):**  for as long as they choose.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:26:31):**  But it also has the feature of allowing them to exit for their own considerations at any  
**[0:26:37-0:26:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:26:37):**  point in time.  
**[0:26:38-0:26:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:26:38):**  I think the notion of having capital locked up without an exit is something that none  
**[0:26:44-0:26:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:26:44):**  of us would accept, not to say that we don't want to be long term holders of stocks or  
**[0:26:49-0:26:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:26:49):**  bonds or farm assets for that matter.  
**[0:26:53-0:26:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:26:53):**  But as things change, we do want that flexibility.  
**[0:26:56-0:26:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:26:56):**  That's obviously a value.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:26:58):**  I think that in the last set of stakeholders are kind of the people in the communities.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:27:03):**  And Wood was kind of referencing this in a different way a moment ago in terms of talking  
**[0:27:08-0:27:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:27:08):**  about resilience.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:27:09):**  But I think part of the risk in investing in agriculture these days has to do with the  
**[0:27:16-0:27:18](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:27:16):**  health of the communities that we work in.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:27:18):**  So our ability to come and really make a commitment to a community and people within that community  
**[0:27:27-0:27:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:27:27):**  that these assets are those investments, our presence is going to be there for multiple  
**[0:27:32-0:27:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:27:32):**  decades is of growing importance in terms of community resiliency.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:27:37):**  But also that community is, I'll call it investment in us, people, resources, the businesses that  
**[0:27:45-0:27:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:27:45):**  are able to make those types of commitments and be contributing members of those communities,  
**[0:27:51-0:27:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:27:51):**  not only extract, but have the opportunity to give back.  
**[0:27:55-0:27:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:27:55):**  And if you will, there is an opportunity to virtuous cycle.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:27:59):**  So for example, during this period of COVID, we over the last couple of years, we implemented,  
**[0:28:06-0:28:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:28:06):**  I'll call it not necessarily costly or cheaper labor practices, but ones that were more focused  
**[0:28:13-0:28:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:28:13):**  on creating kind of a permanent workforce, one that is more fully employed on a time  
**[0:28:20-0:28:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:28:20):**  basis, but also kind of have gainful employment over a long period of time.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:28:26):**  And those workers response and the communities response in a period of time where they believe  
**[0:28:31-0:28:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:28:31):**  a partner is at the table and working with them and after the same goals, not only in  
**[0:28:36-0:28:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:28:36):**  terms of their financial health and their wellbeing, but their communities and getting  
**[0:28:40-0:28:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:28:40):**  healthy and good food to the people in their communities as well to a global audience.  
**[0:28:46-0:28:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:28:46):**  It does show up in terms of risk reduction and return.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:28:49):**  It is in a straight line.  
**[0:28:51-0:28:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:28:51):**  I can't necessarily parse out what portion of our return is due to the goodwill that  
**[0:28:57-0:28:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:28:57):**  we've built it up in the communities.  
**[0:28:58-0:29:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:28:58):**  But I can tell you for certain when we, when the world was shutting down several weeks  
**[0:29:04-0:29:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:29:04):**  ago, our teams kind of pulled themselves up by the bootstraps and were partners with us  
**[0:29:11-0:29:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:29:11):**  and trying to figure out what to do and how to keep businesses running and keep the assets  
**[0:29:15-0:29:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:29:15):**  running and making sure food is grown, food is picked and food gets to the destinations.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:29:20):**  It sounds crazy, but in this current environment, that's not a trivial statement.  
**[0:29:24-0:29:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:29:24):**  And it is in large part due to those people that are on the front lines in our business.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:29:29):**  And we think a lot of their, not all, I don't want to overstate what we've done, but I bet  
**[0:29:34-0:29:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:29:34):**  you if you go talk to them, the things that we do matter and it matters in terms of how  
**[0:29:39-0:29:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:29:39):**  they approach their work and how they engage with us as a business and with the investors  
**[0:29:45-0:29:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:29:45):**  that we represent.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:29:46):**  One of the things that I take away from what Atish just said as well is sort of almost  
**[0:29:50-0:29:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:29:50):**  a broad or big 10 definition, if you will, of regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:29:55-0:29:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:29:55):**  You started this conversation by saying, what brought us to soil?  
**[0:29:58-0:30:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:29:58):**  We have our own answers for that.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:30:00):**  But to be honest with you, I think when you really are trying to build a fully value creating  
**[0:30:06-0:30:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:30:06):**  agricultural business, you have to think about what regeneration means across a number of  
**[0:30:10-0:30:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:30:10):**  different areas as well.  
**[0:30:12-0:30:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:30:12):**  So sure, it's regenerating soil.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:30:14):**  It's also regenerating habitat.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:30:16):**  It's also regenerating local communities.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:30:17):**  And I think all three of those things, how we're regenerating or rebuilding working landscapes,  
**[0:30:23-0:30:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:30:23):**  how we're regenerating natural resources, air, water, soil, and how we're reinforcing  
**[0:30:30-0:30:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:30:30):**  the quality of rural agriculture, rural economies are all three part of it for us.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:30:35):**  And you can't have them to me and to Atish and to our team, you can't have a fully baked  
**[0:30:41-0:30:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:30:41):**  picture of regenerative agriculture without all those things.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:30:44):**  I would argue that this work we're trying to do to sort of piece together or put together  
**[0:30:48-0:30:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:30:48):**  year round employment for our teams.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:30:51):**  It's fundamental and I don't think many people realize how different that is from, because  
**[0:30:55-0:31:01](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:30:55):**  I know many farm communities now that are scrambling because the asparagus pickers may  
**[0:31:01-0:31:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:31:01):**  not show up or the strawberry pickers may not show up.  
**[0:31:04-0:31:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:31:04):**  Correct.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:31:05):**  It's imperfect for us, but it is very intentional for us how we do that and who we partner with  
**[0:31:10-0:31:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:31:10):**  to bring that to fruition.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:31:11):**  And if you think about the way Atish described our business, I mean, there's a lot of reasons  
**[0:31:16-0:31:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:31:16):**  why we have the ability to farm the crops we farm.  
**[0:31:19-0:31:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:31:19):**  We have track record.  
**[0:31:20-0:31:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:31:20):**  Hundreds of our team have track record in those crops.  
**[0:31:22-0:31:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:31:22):**  We happen to be operating in places where supply chains are very efficient for those  
**[0:31:27-0:31:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:31:27):**  kinds of crops.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:31:28):**  So it's great for that purpose.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:31:29):**  There's access to global markets from where we are.  
**[0:31:31-0:31:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:31:31):**  There's all these different pieces that are great.  
**[0:31:33-0:31:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:31:33):**  But another thing that I want to bring to your attention is if you think about the beginning  
**[0:31:37-0:31:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:31:37):**  of the year, January to March or April, we've got California citrus and we move into California  
**[0:31:44-0:31:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:31:44):**  blueberries.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:47](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:31:45):**  Then we move into Oregon blueberries.  
**[0:31:47-0:31:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:31:47):**  Then we move into Oregon hazelnuts.  
**[0:31:49-0:31:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:31:49):**  Then we move into California table grapes over the course of a calendar year.  
**[0:31:53-0:31:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:31:53):**  And that's, you know, some in our business may argue that I don't think it is.  
**[0:31:58-0:32:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:31:58):**  I actually think it's essential to how we think about synergies that exist across the  
**[0:32:02-0:32:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:32:02):**  business, whether it be labor, whether it be water, whether it be equipment, whether  
**[0:32:06-0:32:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:32:06):**  it be these other pieces that actually help build a truly resilient system that doesn't  
**[0:32:11-0:32:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:32:11):**  always get hammered when there's some blip in the time horizon.  
**[0:32:15-0:32:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:32:15):**  So I don't want to overstate that.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:32:17):**  But I do think there's a lot to think about there, and I think a lot about that should  
**[0:32:21-0:32:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:32:21):**  be reassuring to investors about how broadly we're thinking about that diversification.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:32:26):**  I think it comes down to a discussion we as society need to have not only on the food  
**[0:32:32-0:32:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:32:32):**  system, but definitely on the food system.  
**[0:32:33-0:32:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:32:33):**  How far can you push an efficient system or how far can you push a system for efficiency?  
**[0:32:39-0:32:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:32:39):**  And when does it start to become very risky when shocks happen, which we are now living  
**[0:32:44-0:32:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:32:44):**  in a world where shocks constantly happen, either weather or other things.  
**[0:32:48-0:32:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:32:48):**  And the fact that you can still ship grapes or you can still ship citrus compared to neighbors  
**[0:32:53-0:32:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:32:53):**  that that are that can't or to other portfolio pieces of investors that simply are completely  
**[0:32:59-0:33:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:32:59):**  blocked.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:33:00):**  That's going to make the difference at the end of the year to an OK result, to a good  
**[0:33:04-0:33:06](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:33:04):**  result or to not OK at all.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:33:06):**  And I think the push for efficiency and for supply chains that were managed very, very  
**[0:33:11-0:33:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:33:11):**  well when everything goes well, it's perfect until stuff doesn't go well anymore.  
**[0:33:16-0:33:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:33:16):**  And we have to realize that it can come from anywhere and it might be weather and it might  
**[0:33:21-0:33:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:33:21):**  be something else.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:33:22):**  But these shocks are not going to go away.  
**[0:33:23-0:33:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:33:23):**  And I think we especially important in key areas like food, like health care issues,  
**[0:33:29-0:33:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:33:29):**  we need to be thinking very differently about efficiency and effectiveness because you want  
**[0:33:33-0:33:37](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:33:33):**  to have access to these things, because it's not that you can wait two months or something  
**[0:33:37-0:33:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:33:37):**  because we still need to eat.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:33:39):**  I think there's going to be a discussion, but obviously it sort of collides with our  
**[0:33:42-0:33:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:33:42):**  efficient investment thinking as well.  
**[0:33:45-0:33:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:33:45):**  So it's going to be a very interesting period when everything slowly and again, we're in  
**[0:33:49-0:33:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:33:49):**  April 2020, so we're still thinking we're going to slowly reopen.  
**[0:33:52-0:33:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:33:52):**  I don't know if they were going to look back at this podcast.  
**[0:33:54-0:33:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:33:54):**  I think that never happened.  
**[0:33:55-0:33:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:33:55):**  But as we're slowly probably going to reopen, we're going to think about efficiencies and  
**[0:33:59-0:34:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:33:59):**  we're going to think about, I think, food systems very differently, or I hope at least  
**[0:34:03-0:34:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:34:03):**  because this should be a wake up call for a lot more shocks that are as we're all looking  
**[0:34:08-0:34:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:34:08):**  into climate change are on the horizon.  
**[0:34:10-0:34:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:34:10):**  So when I end, I want to be conscious of your time because I know you have other things  
**[0:34:13-0:34:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:34:13):**  to do.  
**[0:34:14-0:34:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:34:14):**  I want to end with, I say one final question, which never is the case.  
**[0:34:17-0:34:19](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:34:17):**  I want to end with two final questions.  
**[0:34:19-0:34:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:34:19):**  If you could change one thing overnight, so we wake up tomorrow.  
**[0:34:22-0:34:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:34:22):**  I already asked that more specifically about a fund structure, but let's take it broader  
**[0:34:26-0:34:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:34:26):**  into regenerative agriculture and food.  
**[0:34:28-0:34:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:34:28):**  If you have a magic wand and I want to ask both of you the question, and if you could  
**[0:34:32-0:34:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:34:32):**  one thing could be changed tomorrow, what would that be?  
**[0:34:35-0:34:36](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:34:35):**  Yeah, let me start.  
**[0:34:36-0:34:42](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:34:36):**  So it's actually simple, but if I was king for the day, I create a kind of a graduated  
**[0:34:42-0:34:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:34:42):**  or progressive tax system that lowers the tax for long duration for holds to zero.  
**[0:34:51-0:34:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:34:51):**  So other way to state that, maybe the better way to state that is one, a tax system that  
**[0:34:57-0:35:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:34:57):**  would incentivize people to hold for longer periods of time and decrease the tax for the  
**[0:35:04-0:35:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:35:04):**  longer you held something down to zero.  
**[0:35:07-0:35:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:35:07):**  And would?  
**[0:35:08-0:35:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:35:08):**  Well, assuming that I can have two things.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:35:10):**  I mean, you're king for the day, so I mean, I'm not deciding anymore.  
**[0:35:13-0:35:21](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:35:13):**  I would say a robust and active market for carbon that would incentivize regenerative  
**[0:35:21-0:35:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:35:21):**  practices at a multitude of scales.  
**[0:35:24-0:35:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:35:24):**  That would be amazing to be able to turn that on today.  
**[0:35:27-0:35:28](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:35:27):**  And right now it's too hard.  
**[0:35:28-0:35:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:35:28):**  We're scrambling, we're struggling too hard to get to a place where that actually is meaningful.  
**[0:35:32-0:35:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:35:32):**  And secondly, I would say I have gotten to the point where I am absolutely done with  
**[0:35:38-0:35:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:35:38):**  this dichotomy that people want to create between small growers, small family farms,  
**[0:35:44-0:35:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:35:44):**  and larger producers.  
**[0:35:46-0:35:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:35:46):**  We do not believe in that dichotomy.  
**[0:35:48-0:35:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:35:48):**  We actually believe that the only way to do this in a meaningful way is to build healthy  
**[0:35:53-0:36:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:35:53):**  ecosystems that involve producers at a number of scales who are incentivized, inclined,  
**[0:36:00-0:36:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:36:00):**  motivated to work with each other in a variety of ways.  
**[0:36:02-0:36:07](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:36:02):**  And I see people calling me today saying we work with small growers or medium sized growers  
**[0:36:07-0:36:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:36:07):**  who are really struggling right now trying to figure out how to get their product to  
**[0:36:10-0:36:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:36:10):**  market.  
**[0:36:11-0:36:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:36:11):**  There should be easier ways for those people to work with folks like us to be able to help  
**[0:36:14-0:36:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:36:14):**  them with packing or help them with shipping or helping them with marketing.  
**[0:36:17-0:36:20](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:36:17):**  But right now there is a split that exists in the food system.  
**[0:36:20-0:36:25](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:36:20):**  And I would argue that it largely comes from the smaller side of the equation where they  
**[0:36:25-0:36:31](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:36:25):**  look at large growers, large producers, and put labels on groups like us that I think  
**[0:36:31-0:36:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:36:31):**  are completely inappropriate and out of sync with sort of what the reality is.  
**[0:36:35-0:36:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:36:35):**  We want to, going back to my comment about land management and soil and doing this at  
**[0:36:40-0:36:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:36:40):**  a scale that really matters, we want to actually get to a place where there is a lot more land  
**[0:36:45-0:36:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:36:45):**  that is managed to the ideal degree that a small grower would bring to their own family  
**[0:36:50-0:36:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:36:50):**  farm.  
**[0:36:51-0:36:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:36:51):**  And we have the ability to do that at a scale that we haven't been able to see before.  
**[0:36:55-0:37:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:36:55):**  And I think that's something that we all should think about in building truly resilient, connected  
**[0:37:00-0:37:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:37:00):**  communities of producers and growers.  
**[0:37:02-0:37:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:37:02):**  So I'd like to see that conflict go away.  
**[0:37:05-0:37:08](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:37:05):**  And here comes my final question.  
**[0:37:08-0:37:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:37:08):**  Might open another box of Pandora, but what are your plans in terms of fundraising your  
**[0:37:14-0:37:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:37:14):**  ideas for the rest of the year?  
**[0:37:15-0:37:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:37:15):**  For April 2020, as we said, you are thinking, considering, or were at least a third fund.  
**[0:37:22-0:37:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:37:22):**  What is your thinking there?  
**[0:37:24-0:37:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:37:24):**  Maybe I'll start on that one, Cohen, and let Atish finish.  
**[0:37:26-0:37:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:37:26):**  But I would say, I get excited about, you and I have talked in other contexts about  
**[0:37:30-0:37:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:37:30):**  better ways to sort of bring farms and operations like we have to life for investors who may  
**[0:37:35-0:37:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:37:35):**  not be able to travel as well, who may have a difficult time trying to figure out what  
**[0:37:38-0:37:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:37:38):**  to do in this particular context.  
**[0:37:40-0:37:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:37:40):**  How can we bring our operations to life in a way that actually capitalizes or mimics  
**[0:37:44-0:37:48](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:37:44):**  some of what we would normally do and getting someone out to fill the soil or be on the  
**[0:37:48-0:37:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:37:48):**  ground?  
**[0:37:49-0:37:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:37:49):**  I think that's exciting.  
**[0:37:50-0:37:52](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:37:50):**  I would just say something very simple here.  
**[0:37:52-0:37:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:37:52):**  We want to continue to tell this story.  
**[0:37:53-0:37:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:37:53):**  We want to be able to have as much inbound questions and comments and engagement from  
**[0:37:59-0:38:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:37:59):**  people who are interested in these kinds of ideas to help us advance what we're trying  
**[0:38:03-0:38:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:38:03):**  to do.  
**[0:38:04-0:38:09](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:38:04):**  So continue to tell the story and do it in more creative and meaningful and post-COVID  
**[0:38:09-0:38:11](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:38:09):**  ways that we possibly can.  
**[0:38:11-0:38:14](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:38:11):**  But Atish is on the front lines of that, so I'll let him finish.  
**[0:38:14-0:38:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:38:14):**  Yeah, and appreciate the question.  
**[0:38:16-0:38:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:38:16):**  So I'll quickly say due to securities regulations in many parts of the world, we can't get into  
**[0:38:22-0:38:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:38:22):**  any details in terms of what our plans were and what they will be.  
**[0:38:27-0:38:32](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:38:27):**  But let me, of course, let me mention maybe two or three kind of interesting topics that  
**[0:38:32-0:38:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:38:32):**  we hope to explore and maybe a year or a year and a half from now, come back and do a follow-up  
**[0:38:39-0:38:44](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:38:39):**  and kind of tell you how things went with some of these topics.  
**[0:38:44-0:38:53](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:38:44):**  So one, I'm very curious to see how people internalize risk regenerative environmental  
**[0:38:53-0:38:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:38:53):**  issues past this COVID period.  
**[0:38:57-0:39:02](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:38:57):**  That is not only just food system and supply chain resiliency, but kind of broader environmental  
**[0:39:02-0:39:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:39:02):**  resiliency.  
**[0:39:03-0:39:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:39:03):**  Is this the wake up call, right?  
**[0:39:05-0:39:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:39:05):**  That kind of breaks the camel back in terms of really motivating more interest.  
**[0:39:10-0:39:15](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:39:10):**  So I'm just on a human level, I'm actually very curious how people internalize risk and  
**[0:39:15-0:39:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:39:15):**  opportunity after this period of time.  
**[0:39:17-0:39:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:39:17):**  Aside from the maybe more heavy kind of topics, I'm also actually very interested to see kind  
**[0:39:23-0:39:26](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:39:23):**  of the practical implementation.  
**[0:39:26-0:39:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:39:26):**  I think 2020 was going to be a pivotal year in terms of ESG regulation and reporting in  
**[0:39:33-0:39:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:39:33):**  Europe.  
**[0:39:34-0:39:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:39:34):**  And we're very curious, we can already share that the amount of inbound interest from Europe  
**[0:39:41-0:39:49](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:39:41):**  has been amazing over the whole history of AC, but in particularly the last 12 months  
**[0:39:49-0:39:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:39:49):**  and the last year and beginning of this year before other issues obviously took our attention  
**[0:39:55-0:39:57](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:39:55):**  onto other topics.  
**[0:39:57-0:40:03](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:39:57):**  So I'm very curious to see how Europe implements some of the stated changes that have been  
**[0:40:03-0:40:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:40:03):**  in the works for a couple of years.  
**[0:40:05-0:40:13](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:40:05):**  I think the last thing I'm curious to see is how do investment opportunities change  
**[0:40:13-0:40:16](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:40:13):**  and how do we fit in that landscape?  
**[0:40:16-0:40:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:40:16):**  Not due to a COVID kind of COVID trigger, but kind of more broadly, I think the interest  
**[0:40:22-0:40:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:40:22):**  from individual investors and family and offices and institutions globally have just been increasing.  
**[0:40:29-0:40:34](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:40:29):**  And there's nothing to say that that trend isn't going to continue to increase.  
**[0:40:34-0:40:40](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:40:34):**  I think the thing that we're interested in seeing is how does that change behavior for  
**[0:40:40-0:40:41](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:40:40):**  investment managers?  
**[0:40:41-0:40:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:40:41):**  How does it change the products that are available to the average investor?  
**[0:40:46-0:40:51](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:40:46):**  We're shocked that on a daily basis, we're getting emails from just individual investors  
**[0:40:51-0:40:55](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:40:51):**  who have somehow found us on their own and say, these are the things that I want to be  
**[0:40:55-0:40:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:40:55):**  investing in, the things that you're doing.  
**[0:40:58-0:40:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:40:58):**  How do you invest?  
**[0:40:59-0:41:04](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:40:59):**  And unfortunately, we don't have that consumer offering just given for a number of different  
**[0:41:04-0:41:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:41:04):**  reasons.  
**[0:41:05-0:41:10](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:41:05):**  But if that interest is there, and just based on data and inbound interest, I can tell you  
**[0:41:10-0:41:12](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:41:10):**  that interest is there and increasing.  
**[0:41:12-0:41:17](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:41:12):**  How's that really going to change what investment products are available to us on a daily basis?  
**[0:41:17-0:41:23](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:41:17):**  And what that means in terms of how do large asset managers and fund managers think about  
**[0:41:23-0:41:24](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:41:23):**  what they're doing?  
**[0:41:24-0:41:30](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:41:24):**  I'm always optimistic about where consumers can take us over the long term.  
**[0:41:30-0:41:35](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:41:30):**  And I think here, there's a lot to be hopeful for, especially in terms of the next generations  
**[0:41:35-0:41:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:41:35):**  coming up, because they don't see the distinction.  
**[0:41:38-0:41:39](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:41:38):**  They just see this as investing, right?  
**[0:41:39-0:41:43](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:41:39):**  And all investing is going to have this embedded in what they do.  
**[0:41:43-0:41:45](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:41:43):**  Otherwise, they're not going to have those individuals as customers.  
**[0:41:45-0:41:50](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:41:45):**  So those are the three things that I'm really curious to see how they shake out for us as  
**[0:41:50-0:41:56](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:41:50):**  we kind of go to our next steps over the next 12 to 24 months and is taking us to interesting  
**[0:41:56-0:41:58](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:41:56):**  places in terms of discussions.  
**[0:41:58-0:41:59](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:41:58):**  Perfect.  
**[0:41:59-0:42:00](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:41:59):**  Thank you both so much.  
**[0:42:00-0:42:05](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:42:00):**  I want to make sure we end more or less on time, which we are doing.

**[0:44:28-0:44:33](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:44:28):**  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you and I'm very aware  
**[0:44:33-0:44:38](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:44:33):**  that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very different means.

**[0:44:43-0:44:46](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:44:43):**  consider paying what you think it's worth.

**[0:44:48-0:44:54](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:44:48):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides

**[0:45:18-0:45:22](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:45:18):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.

**[0:45:26-0:45:27](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:45:26):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:45:27-0:45:29](https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/05/20/wood-turner-atish-babu/#t=0:45:27):**  It's not a list of investable deals.

## Sarah D. Levesque and Anthony Corsaro - RFSI Forum September 2021  
**[0:00:00-0:00:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-d-levesque-and-anthony-corsaro#t=0:00:00):**  The Regenerative Food Systems Investment Forum is happening again in person in Oakland on September 28th and 29th.  
**[0:00:07-0:00:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-d-levesque-and-anthony-corsaro#t=0:00:07):**  And I'm joined by Sarah and Antonio to share a bit more about it.  
**[0:00:12-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-d-levesque-and-anthony-corsaro#t=0:00:12):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture, Investing as if the Planet Mattered,  
**[0:00:18-0:00:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-d-levesque-and-anthony-corsaro#t=0:00:18):**  a podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:22-0:00:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-d-levesque-and-anthony-corsaro#t=0:00:22):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities and ecosystems  
**[0:00:29-0:00:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-d-levesque-and-anthony-corsaro#t=0:00:29):**  while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:32-0:00:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-d-levesque-and-anthony-corsaro#t=0:00:32):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:34-0:00:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-d-levesque-and-anthony-corsaro#t=0:00:34):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:00:41-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-d-levesque-and-anthony-corsaro#t=0:00:41):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:00:49-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-d-levesque-and-anthony-corsaro#t=0:00:49):**  In March last year we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support our work.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-d-levesque-and-anthony-corsaro#t=0:00:54):**  And so many of you have joined as a member.  
**[0:00:57-0:01:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-d-levesque-and-anthony-corsaro#t=0:00:57):**  We've launched different types of benefits, exclusive content, Q&A webinars with former guests,  
**[0:01:02-0:01:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-d-levesque-and-anthony-corsaro#t=0:01:02):**  Ask Me Anything sessions, plus so much more to come in the future.

**[0:01:14-0:01:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-d-levesque-and-anthony-corsaro#t=0:01:14):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-d-levesque-and-anthony-corsaro#t=0:01:16):**  Hi Antonio, welcome on the show.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-d-levesque-and-anthony-corsaro#t=0:01:18):**  Could you briefly explain what the RFSI forum is, when, where it's happening, etc.?  
**[0:01:23-0:01:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-d-levesque-and-anthony-corsaro#t=0:01:23):**  Yes, absolutely.  
**[0:01:25-0:01:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-d-levesque-and-anthony-corsaro#t=0:01:25):**  So the RFSI forum is our marquee event and is happening this year in person in Oakland, California on September 28th and 29th.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-d-levesque-and-anthony-corsaro#t=0:01:36):**  And it's really all about catalyzing connection and capital in regenerative ag and food systems.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-d-levesque-and-anthony-corsaro#t=0:01:41):**  And it's a place we think where the funders of regeneration and the other key stakeholders in the food system can meet and learn from each other.  
**[0:01:50-0:01:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-d-levesque-and-anthony-corsaro#t=0:01:50):**  So we can continue to create a more resilient food system overall.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-d-levesque-and-anthony-corsaro#t=0:01:53):**  Hi Sarah, great to have you back on the show.  
**[0:01:55-0:02:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-d-levesque-and-anthony-corsaro#t=0:01:55):**  Could you please share why after a great first edition two years ago, which we were very lucky enough to attend and a very big one,  
**[0:02:01-0:02:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-d-levesque-and-anthony-corsaro#t=0:02:01):**  over 400 people I heard on the virtual edition last year, you decided to run another one in person this September?  
**[0:02:08-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-d-levesque-and-anthony-corsaro#t=0:02:08):**  Yeah, thanks, Kun.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-d-levesque-and-anthony-corsaro#t=0:02:09):**  It's great to be back and to be able to talk about our in-person gathering next month in Oakland.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-d-levesque-and-anthony-corsaro#t=0:02:13):**  A good question about being in person.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-d-levesque-and-anthony-corsaro#t=0:02:16):**  We definitely appreciate how this global community is connected so well virtually over the past 18 months.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-d-levesque-and-anthony-corsaro#t=0:02:21):**  And we're super excited to offer opportunities for virtual convenings in the future.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-d-levesque-and-anthony-corsaro#t=0:02:25):**  But there is just something so powerful about bringing people together face to face to learn and connect at a different level.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-d-levesque-and-anthony-corsaro#t=0:02:32):**  For example, we know that after our 2019 event that was in person, new businesses were formed and investments secured as a result of the relationships built on site at the event.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-d-levesque-and-anthony-corsaro#t=0:02:44):**  Those results drive real impact in our space.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-d-levesque-and-anthony-corsaro#t=0:02:46):**  And that's why it's important for us to gather in person.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-d-levesque-and-anthony-corsaro#t=0:02:49):**  The other more selfish reason just maybe that I miss all those great conversations that happen in the off hours at the bar and elsewhere.  
**[0:02:57-0:02:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-d-levesque-and-anthony-corsaro#t=0:02:57):**  That's something I have certainly missed.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-d-levesque-and-anthony-corsaro#t=0:02:59):**  And besides the forum, what else have you been up to regarding investing in region egg and food?  
**[0:03:03-0:03:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-d-levesque-and-anthony-corsaro#t=0:03:03):**  That's a great question.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-d-levesque-and-anthony-corsaro#t=0:03:04):**  It's actually a funny story.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-d-levesque-and-anthony-corsaro#t=0:03:06):**  So I started out as an RFSI audience member myself as an investor looking for ways to deploy capital in the space.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-d-levesque-and-anthony-corsaro#t=0:03:15):**  And so I was listening to a lot of your podcasts.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-d-levesque-and-anthony-corsaro#t=0:03:18):**  I was reading a lot of the content and consuming the content that RFSI was putting out, attending some events.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-d-levesque-and-anthony-corsaro#t=0:03:25):**  So it was a really interesting journey.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-d-levesque-and-anthony-corsaro#t=0:03:27):**  But once Sarah posted the role to join the team, I was kind of all over it.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-d-levesque-and-anthony-corsaro#t=0:03:31):**  Personally, on the investing side, I've been making some investments in the space with multiple people you've featured on the pod, which is great and exciting.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-d-levesque-and-anthony-corsaro#t=0:03:38):**  Some in the robotics and ag tech space, some in the fiber space, some in the consumer brand space, and then some larger funds overall.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-d-levesque-and-anthony-corsaro#t=0:03:47):**  On top of all that, my entrepreneurial venture is called Regeneration Nation, which is an apparel brand for the heroes and advocates of regenerative ag.  
**[0:03:56-0:03:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-d-levesque-and-anthony-corsaro#t=0:03:56):**  And that has been soft launched to the world.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-d-levesque-and-anthony-corsaro#t=0:03:58):**  And right now we're building some momentum and a follower and a newsletter base so we can launch our first collection before the end of this calendar year.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-d-levesque-and-anthony-corsaro#t=0:04:07):**  And why should all that can obviously in these crazy times try to attend the upcoming forum?  
**[0:04:12-0:04:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-d-levesque-and-anthony-corsaro#t=0:04:12):**  Yeah, as you know well from your work, Coon, regenerative food systems and investment in them has evolved a lot in the past two years.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-d-levesque-and-anthony-corsaro#t=0:04:20):**  So there's lots to talk about, lots to learn and many new people to meet.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-d-levesque-and-anthony-corsaro#t=0:04:24):**  We have an incredible lineup of speakers and sessions planned for this year's forum.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-d-levesque-and-anthony-corsaro#t=0:04:29):**  And not to mention some amazing sponsors led by our presenting sponsor, Trailhead Capital.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-d-levesque-and-anthony-corsaro#t=0:04:34):**  We're super excited to have them and others on board.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-d-levesque-and-anthony-corsaro#t=0:04:36):**  We're going to cover everything from investment strategy and successful case studies to consumer demand, technology and carbon markets and much more.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-d-levesque-and-anthony-corsaro#t=0:04:45):**  In short, this event will equip attendees with the latest and leading information, resources and people necessary to move the space forward.  
**[0:04:54-0:04:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/sarah-d-levesque-and-anthony-corsaro#t=0:04:54):**  We really can't wait to see old friends and all the new faces in September.

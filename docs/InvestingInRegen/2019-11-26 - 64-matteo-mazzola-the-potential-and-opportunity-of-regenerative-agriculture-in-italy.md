**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:00:14):**  You're going to listen to an interview with regenerative farmer Matteo Mazzola, who after  
**[0:00:18-0:00:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:00:18):**  many years of working with leading region farmers from around the world has set up a  
**[0:00:22-0:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:00:22):**  beautiful farm with his partner Paola in northern Italy.  
**[0:00:26-0:00:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:00:26):**  Thanks to developing their farm he is creating his vision for how regenerative agriculture  
**[0:00:30-0:00:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:00:30):**  in Italy could and should evolve into a system where city and countryside meet and ecology  
**[0:00:35-0:00:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:00:35):**  and landscapes lead the way.  
**[0:00:39-0:00:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:00:39):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture.  
**[0:00:43-0:00:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:00:43):**  Investing as if the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:00:45):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:49-0:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:00:49):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:00:54-0:00:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:00:54):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:00:59):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:01-0:01:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:01:01):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:05-0:01:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:01:05):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:08-0:01:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:01:08):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:13-0:01:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:01:13):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:01:17):**  In March last year we launched our Patreon community to make it easy for fans to support  
**[0:01:21-0:01:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:01:21):**  our work and so many of you have joined as a member.

**[0:01:41-0:01:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:01:41):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:01:43):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:01:47):**  I'm here with Matteo Mazzola who is a very interesting regenerative farmer in Northern  
**[0:01:51-0:01:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:01:51):**  Italy but who has traveled the world and worked on many different sides.  
**[0:01:56-0:02:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:01:56):**  And I'm interested to take a deep dive into his vision of regenerative agriculture but  
**[0:02:01-0:02:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:02:01):**  of course also to hear what's happening here in Italy and what are the biggest barriers  
**[0:02:05-0:02:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:02:05):**  and opportunities.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:02:06):**  Welcome, Matteo.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:02:07):**  Thank you.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:02:08):**  To start with the personal question I always love to ask, why soil?  
**[0:02:13-0:02:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:02:13):**  Why agriculture?  
**[0:02:14-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:02:14):**  What happened?  
**[0:02:15-0:02:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:02:15):**  What went wrong?  
**[0:02:16-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:02:16):**  What went right?  
**[0:02:17-0:02:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:02:17):**  And how did you end up owning this farm at Lago di Zeo?  
**[0:02:20-0:02:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:02:20):**  Well, we have to look back many, many years.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:02:27):**  I don't come from a farmer's family.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:02:31):**  I grew up in a town, quite a big town, but I was always very interested about the natural  
**[0:02:38-0:02:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:02:38):**  world, living outside and not really accepting to be in a school, in a room.  
**[0:02:45-0:02:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:02:45):**  So I grew up really loving what was nature.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:02:48):**  Basically, when I was six, seven years old, I was reading and actually not really reading  
**[0:02:53-0:02:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:02:53):**  but looking at the pictures of the book of John Saymore on self-sufficiency, which was  
**[0:02:59-0:03:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:02:59):**  basically teaching you on how to do anything on your farm.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:03:05):**  And from there on, really, I've been cultivating my love and passion for nature in all its  
**[0:03:13-0:03:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:03:13):**  form, lots of observation all the time.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:03:16):**  Just love to observe without really trying to understand anything.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:03:20):**  Then I studied at the agricultural high school where we had a farm with animals.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:03:28):**  We had different productive systems like rice, cereals.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:03:34):**  We had orchard.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:03:36):**  We had vegetables.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:03:37):**  We had a bit of silviculture.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:03:39):**  There was a bit of everything.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:03:40):**  It was a 35-hectare farm, conventional farming as well as the teachings in the school.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:03:47):**  But it was very good in having a relation with my classmates, which were mostly all  
**[0:03:55-0:03:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:03:55):**  farmers, sons and daughters of farmers.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:03:58):**  Two days after high school, I just grabbed my bicycle and I started to travel around  
**[0:04:05-0:04:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:04:05):**  Europe with the focus of ecosystem observation and also going to work and to study in certain  
**[0:04:13-0:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:04:13):**  projects I was interested to get a deeper understanding.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:04:18):**  And basically, I choose not to go to university because I believe also is what I believe now  
**[0:04:24-0:04:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:04:24):**  is the leading principle of who I am and what I do, of what I do is that we first have to  
**[0:04:36-0:04:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:04:36):**  understand what we are made for, but especially we have to understand what is the pace and  
**[0:04:42-0:04:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:04:42):**  the type of workflow that we need to…  
**[0:04:47-0:04:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:04:47):**  The pace and the way we do the things that we do is very important to understand in which  
**[0:04:54-0:04:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:04:54):**  direction to go.  
**[0:04:55-0:05:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:04:55):**  For example, creating my own university has allowed me to go much faster in the understanding  
**[0:05:03-0:05:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:05:03):**  of certain principles, not stressing myself about learning something that I would have  
**[0:05:09-0:05:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:05:09):**  never used in the future, as well as something that would have moved my understanding of  
**[0:05:15-0:05:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:05:15):**  certain things in a different direction than going into a more natural flow of things,  
**[0:05:23-0:05:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:05:23):**  which sounds a bit naive, but again, is about time efficiency, as well as reaching a result  
**[0:05:33-0:05:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:05:33):**  in a fast but good way without wasting energy, without wasting too much money, without wasting  
**[0:05:41-0:05:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:05:41):**  too much time.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:05:42):**  And when you say creating your university, it means creating your education path yourself,  
**[0:05:48-0:05:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:05:48):**  basically, and can you give an example of maybe the most surprising lesson during your  
**[0:05:53-0:05:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:05:53):**  university years, or your education years and your study years, which continue obviously,  
**[0:05:59-0:06:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:05:59):**  but you were the young Matteo on his bike going through Europe, what was a special moment  
**[0:06:06-0:06:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:06:06):**  or something you still remember as an aha moment, or for sure there are many, but if  
**[0:06:11-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:06:11):**  you had to pick one now, a few years later, what would that be?  
**[0:06:15-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:06:15):**  Actually it's not really one event, but it's a series of events connected with the possibility  
**[0:06:23-0:06:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:06:23):**  that I had of observing landscape through perception, not just by looking at the landscape,  
**[0:06:31-0:06:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:06:31):**  but with all the senses to live the landscape that I was sort of passing by and doing this  
**[0:06:39-0:06:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:06:39):**  for 12-13 hours a day for months or for years, because this is what it has been.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:06:47):**  It really teaches you something that then will help you in anything you will do, because  
**[0:06:56-0:07:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:06:56):**  it is about functional observation, but at the same time observing and perceiving without  
**[0:07:03-0:07:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:07:03):**  expectations, without judgement, which again, it sounds something very naive, very unscientific,  
**[0:07:10-0:07:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:07:10):**  but basically it's the base of science.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:07:13):**  It's like not giving your ideas too much importance and just especially observing ecosystems changing,  
**[0:07:21-0:07:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:07:21):**  consortium of species dynamics and behaviours of nature in certain parts of Europe, repeating  
**[0:07:29-0:07:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:07:29):**  in certain other parts of Europe.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:07:31):**  Maybe you don't get it straight away, the connection, but little by little when you  
**[0:07:34-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:07:34):**  work in agriculture, you work into everything that is connected to ecology and managing  
**[0:07:40-0:07:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:07:40):**  ecosystems, then little by little it comes back, not really what you have seen, but the  
**[0:07:47-0:07:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:07:47):**  principles that you manage to pick, you pick from your multiple observations, like repetition,  
**[0:07:54-0:08:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:07:54):**  continuous repetition of observation is what creates the foundation of understanding a  
**[0:08:00-0:08:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:08:00):**  little bit more nature and our impact on nature when we do something.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:08:07):**  So basically this was the most important thing.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:08:10):**  People often ask me, oh, you did the course with Joel Salatin or with David Holmgren or  
**[0:08:20-0:08:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:08:20):**  with this and that.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:08:21):**  I was very lucky to visit and to stay and to work and to live with many of these amazing  
**[0:08:28-0:08:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:08:28):**  farmers and scientists and so on.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:08:32):**  But again, the humblest experience was from what I understand, what I think the most important,  
**[0:08:44-0:08:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:08:44):**  the one that really allowed me to understand much better all of these people, allowed me  
**[0:08:50-0:08:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:08:50):**  to understand much better principles and insights that I learned in the various courses or in  
**[0:08:55-0:08:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:08:55):**  the farms and in the projects where I've been working and studying.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:08:59):**  So yeah, functional observation has been something I didn't look for.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:09:04):**  It tends to the point.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:09:06):**  If you would be looking for it, functional observation wouldn't be working that way.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:09:11):**  And I would love to unpack a bit of the principles with you and then go to where we are now.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:09:17):**  So if you would have to share a few of those principles that you observed over the years  
**[0:09:24-0:09:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:09:24):**  and over your travels, what would be, is that a long list, first of all?  
**[0:09:28-0:09:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:09:28):**  Are we talking about 20?  
**[0:09:29-0:09:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:09:29):**  Are we talking about two, three, five?  
**[0:09:32-0:09:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:09:32):**  What do you see as the principles in your vision, in your regenerative agriculture work?  
**[0:09:39-0:09:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:09:39):**  Basically, actually, there are maybe not even principles.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:09:44):**  There are more foundations, which basically are connected straightly to energy flow, energy  
**[0:09:57-0:10:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:09:57):**  behavior and how energy, what shapes and behavior energy takes.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:10:08):**  Energy is all about forms and behavior of energy.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:10:14):**  When you observe nature, when you observe ecosystem, when you observe villages, towns,  
**[0:10:20-0:10:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:10:20):**  because everything is nature.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:10:21):**  Everything is just basically elements which have been cooked in a certain way and prepared  
**[0:10:28-0:10:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:10:28):**  in a dish or in another dish.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:10:30):**  And basically the key is to understand that everything comes from either stored energy  
**[0:10:36-0:10:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:10:36):**  or potential energy or most of the time it comes from sun energy, photons, which are  
**[0:10:45-0:10:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:10:45):**  transformed as nature needs in different shapes and behavior.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:10:51):**  And when you understand that, it becomes very easy also to understand that human ethics  
**[0:10:56-0:11:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:10:56):**  are just less than a secondary element of importance when we look at planning and making  
**[0:11:05-0:11:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:11:05):**  projects, when we are working for nature.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:11:08):**  First of all, and if you look at a more eco-centric and non-anthropocentric reality, it is extremely  
**[0:11:18-0:11:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:11:18):**  important to take into account energy behavior and energy flow because it's what dictates,  
**[0:11:25-0:11:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:11:25):**  it's what gives the rule of the game.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:11:28):**  You can't really, either you go and buy energy from outside and you will create a certain  
**[0:11:33-0:11:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:11:33):**  amount of social or environmental unsustainability or you manage to work with what you have.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:11:40):**  And what we have is stored energy, if there is any, and potential energy that we can use.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:11:47):**  So if we really want to be true to ourselves, we shouldn't even think about ethics because  
**[0:11:56-0:11:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:11:56):**  it comes after.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:11:59):**  Nature will decide the ethics, if something can be done sustainably, that's something  
**[0:12:07-0:12:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:12:07):**  it will also become the base of the creation of an ethic.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:12:11):**  But if we keep on allowing ourselves to believe in our own subjective ethics, we will not  
**[0:12:19-0:12:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:12:19):**  really go far.  
**[0:12:21-0:12:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:12:21):**  Do you have an example in agriculture of that, where we don't take we meaning society,  
**[0:12:29-0:12:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:12:29):**  humanity, don't take, don't look at the basic energy flows and by not doing that we basically  
**[0:12:37-0:12:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:12:37):**  create unethical situations?  
**[0:12:39-0:12:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:12:39):**  Yeah, totally.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:12:41):**  Is the easiest thing, is the whole thing about either connected either to agriculture and  
**[0:12:51-0:12:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:12:51):**  nutrition when we are talking about what type of energy, carbohydrates, sugars or fats we  
**[0:12:59-0:13:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:12:59):**  use in our diet in order to move and have the basics, the basic elements for our metabolism.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:13:08):**  So basically when we choose to use more carbohydrates and simple sugars, we basically choose unsustainable  
**[0:13:19-0:13:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:13:19):**  type of agriculture because it is based on annual crops.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:13:24):**  Annual crops by nature are just a very specific tool which is used in the ecological succession  
**[0:13:32-0:13:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:13:32):**  process is a tool that is used by nature in a very short period.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:13:40):**  In most of known completely degraded environments, annual crops or annual plants are basically  
**[0:13:49-0:13:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:13:49):**  covering the soil the first, the second and maximum the third year and then they leave  
**[0:13:54-0:14:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:13:54):**  the space for a more sensible energy managing device which are all the perennials and with  
**[0:14:03-0:14:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:14:03):**  all the animals that will manage the perennials in the most efficient way possible.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:14:11):**  Basically then, rather than producing energy sucking crops and basing our diet on a more  
**[0:14:24-0:14:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:14:24):**  vegetarian diet, we should really think what nature would do if it was in our position  
**[0:14:33-0:14:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:14:33):**  on this field.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:14:34):**  Of course, nature will never choose to keep some annual cereals, some annual legumes,  
**[0:14:43-0:14:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:14:43):**  some annual vegetables, some annual weeds for more than two years and we should learn  
**[0:14:47-0:14:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:14:47):**  from that.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:14:49):**  The alternative is simple, it's based on millions of years of evolution and is either pasture  
**[0:14:56-0:15:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:14:56):**  land managed by a consortium, an orchestra of animals or again, forest which is again  
**[0:15:06-0:15:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:15:06):**  managed by animals and other elements.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:15:10):**  And going to where we are now, your and your partner's farm, how did you, after touring  
**[0:15:18-0:15:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:15:18):**  the world, not only with your bicycle, obviously also with other means, how did you come back  
**[0:15:22-0:15:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:15:22):**  to Italy and decided or came about to buy this six hectare farm at Lago di Zeo which  
**[0:15:31-0:15:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:15:31):**  I've been in a few farms, it's probably one of the most beautiful views, not necessarily  
**[0:15:34-0:15:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:15:34):**  today because it's raining a lot, but in a pretty day it's an absolutely breathtaking  
**[0:15:39-0:15:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:15:39):**  view, not the easiest farm to work with, but how did you ended up here and then what is  
**[0:15:45-0:15:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:15:45):**  Isida as a regenerative farm?  
**[0:15:48-0:15:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:15:48):**  So actually I didn't come back straight to Lake Isia, before I started and managed a  
**[0:15:58-0:16:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:15:58):**  six hectare farm on, just by Lake Garda with other two friends.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:16:04):**  Before that I was in Australia where I went to study with certain farmers or consultants  
**[0:16:11-0:16:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:16:11):**  that I wanted to know from closer and also to check from closer what means broadacre,  
**[0:16:19-0:16:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:16:19):**  permaculture and broadacre regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:16:24):**  And then for me it was time to start a farm after many years of working in other people  
**[0:16:33-0:16:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:16:33):**  farm as well as going to courses and really absorbing lots of experience, information  
**[0:16:43-0:16:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:16:43):**  and so on.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:16:45):**  And just before going to Australia I met Martin and Helene that they wanted to start a farm  
**[0:16:51-0:16:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:16:51):**  and in them I've seen really the right partners to start something which was really the closest  
**[0:16:59-0:17:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:16:59):**  thing to what I wanted to start.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:17:02):**  So I came back, we started a farm, in three years we reached 55 families that were buying  
**[0:17:13-0:17:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:17:13):**  vegetables from us, we were producing bread, pasta from our legumes and cereals and we  
**[0:17:20-0:17:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:17:20):**  also had chickens for eggs as well as chickens for meat on a movable system on our pastures.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:17:30):**  So we were starting a very good farm.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:17:32):**  Then I met Paola during a course I was running on agroforestry and then love made the rest.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:17:42):**  The move to the next valley basically.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:17:44):**  And then actually I didn't choose this farm, Paola my partner did everything for me.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:17:52):**  I was actually telling her but with this money we could get many more hectares and start  
**[0:17:58-0:18:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:17:58):**  something more impactful and start something closer maybe to what is our vision.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:18:06):**  But because of different reasons she was very convinced that this was the land and which  
**[0:18:13-0:18:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:18:13):**  is actually a very beautiful land with very interesting elements also to create a quite  
**[0:18:21-0:18:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:18:21):**  interesting project from an impact, social and media and environmental impact is a quite  
**[0:18:30-0:18:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:18:30):**  good place.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:18:31):**  So if you had to describe Easy to farm in a few, no more than a few sentences, in a  
**[0:18:38-0:18:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:18:38):**  few paragraphs, what would you say now four years after you started more or less?  
**[0:18:43-0:18:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:18:43):**  What is it and where are you now in terms of what do you produce, what do you sell,  
**[0:18:50-0:18:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:18:50):**  to whom and then we'll talk about the future.  
**[0:18:53-0:19:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:18:53):**  Basically now we're producing vegetables, olive oil, different all sorts of fruits,  
**[0:19:01-0:19:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:19:01):**  of course typical from our latitudes, berries and eggs.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:19:10):**  And this more or less is what we produce.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:19:13):**  We also planted some carbohydrates and protein and fat rich perennial crops, so almonds,  
**[0:19:23-0:19:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:19:23):**  hazelnuts and walnuts, but they will take a little bit more time to come into production.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:19:30):**  And we will soon reinforce the whole area and sector of animal production.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:19:38):**  So sheep for meat production and whole, we have different ideas and different projects  
**[0:19:44-0:19:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:19:44):**  on that as well as small animals, chickens, guinea fowls, geese, ducks and individual  
**[0:19:56-0:19:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:19:56):**  rabbits.  
**[0:19:57-0:20:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:19:57):**  Going more and more toward a grassland based productive system or actually I should say  
**[0:20:07-0:20:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:20:07):**  a silvopastoral system where we will have mainly trees, shrubs and grazing animals.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:20:16):**  So at a certain point we will stop to breed, not to breed, we will stop to manage and to  
**[0:20:23-0:20:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:20:23):**  have chickens and all the animals that requires high level of proteins that can be produced  
**[0:20:32-0:20:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:20:32):**  easily on our farm.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:20:34):**  So all the animals that make a good use of grass will be taking place mainly on our productive  
**[0:20:43-0:20:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:20:43):**  systems.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:20:44):**  In terms of transformation, you currently sell everything direct through CSA+, you sell  
**[0:20:50-0:20:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:20:50):**  lots of restaurants, but it's all, I mean you're doing your first few experiments with  
**[0:20:56-0:21:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:20:56):**  the transformation of raw ingredients into other products.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:21:01):**  Can you tell a bit more about that?  
**[0:21:03-0:21:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:21:03):**  Well, yeah, the ideas are many, the bureaucracy limits are many and the idea is really to  
**[0:21:15-0:21:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:21:15):**  increase the nutritional and economical value of every single simple product that we can  
**[0:21:22-0:21:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:21:22):**  produce on our farm in order to increase the potential of what we are doing.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:21:31):**  Natural production for example is extremely energy demanding and resources demanding and  
**[0:21:40-0:21:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:21:40):**  is not something that can be maintained for a long period if we really look at energy  
**[0:21:48-0:21:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:21:48):**  flow and energy consumption.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:21:49):**  What do you mean?  
**[0:21:52-0:21:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:21:52):**  Because you hear a lot of people, especially the smaller organic farms and biodynamic farms  
**[0:21:58-0:22:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:21:58):**  and a lot of the no-till market gardens, etc. focus heavily on veggies, veggie boxes, etc.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:22:05):**  And when you say it's not sustainable in terms of energy, is that on the human side, is that  
**[0:22:10-0:22:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:22:10):**  on the soil side, the input side of all three?  
**[0:22:13-0:22:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:22:13):**  What do you see as a farmer?  
**[0:22:17-0:22:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:22:17):**  Basically all three.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:22:18):**  Vegetables are domesticated.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:22:19):**  I've heard you say they're weeds.  
**[0:22:22-0:22:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:22:22):**  Yeah, they're weeds.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:22:23):**  They're basically domesticated weeds, selected weeds.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:22:25):**  They share the same behavior of natural weeds which are growing normally on either disturbed  
**[0:22:32-0:22:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:22:32):**  soil or a soil with an excess or deficiency in certain elements, which means it's an unbalanced  
**[0:22:42-0:22:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:22:42):**  soil, a soil that straight away we can understand that it can't grow in that right moment very  
**[0:22:50-0:22:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:22:50):**  nutritious and nutrient dense foods.  
**[0:22:54-0:22:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:22:54):**  Because basically most of the time it's not balanced.  
**[0:22:57-0:23:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:22:57):**  We can reach very high level of analyzing the situation in the soil and in the sap of  
**[0:23:04-0:23:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:23:04):**  the plants, but we will be never as intelligent and as capable of understanding the complexity  
**[0:23:12-0:23:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:23:12):**  of the natural cycles of nutrients and connected with the biology.  
**[0:23:17-0:23:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:23:17):**  So for one reason, vegetables became one of the most important elements of micro farms  
**[0:23:26-0:23:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:23:26):**  or small farms, successful farms, is because they create economy very fast because they  
**[0:23:34-0:23:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:23:34):**  are very resilient.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:23:35):**  It's like if I grow a tree from the first year to the third, fourth, I have to wait  
**[0:23:41-0:23:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:23:41):**  a long time before seeing the production.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:23:44):**  And it could be that during the flowering or during the fruit set, an hail or a frost,  
**[0:23:49-0:23:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:23:49):**  late frost or something like that, it will compromise completely the production for another  
**[0:23:55-0:23:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:23:55):**  year.  
**[0:23:56-0:24:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:23:56):**  So of course, from an economical point of view, vegetables are much more resilient.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:24:00):**  From a short term.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:24:01):**  From a short term, yeah, exactly.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:24:04):**  Especially with climate change, often it happens that vegetables, maybe yeah, you will lose  
**[0:24:09-0:24:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:24:09):**  some vegetables, but there will be always something surviving.  
**[0:24:14-0:24:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:24:14):**  But from ecological point of view, to produce properly vegetables, you need a lot of carbon  
**[0:24:21-0:24:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:24:21):**  coming from outside, which it could be no dig gardening with layer of compost.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:24:27):**  It could be mulch gardens, market gardens, but you will need wood chips coming from somewhere  
**[0:24:34-0:24:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:24:34):**  else that wood chips that have been produced using a petrol engine, petrol powered machine.  
**[0:24:45-0:24:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:24:45):**  So vegetables, they don't produce enough biomass to feed themselves in the future generations  
**[0:24:51-0:24:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:24:51):**  as well as to cover the soil enough to activate all of those processes of soil building, soil  
**[0:24:59-0:25:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:24:59):**  regeneration that are needed to change our presence on the landscape and on this planet.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:25:07):**  With your functional observation on this piece of six hectares, you started with easy, I  
**[0:25:16-0:25:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:25:16):**  mean, it's not easy, fast cashflow, vegetables, etc.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:25:19):**  But at the same time, planted a lot of trees, obviously on key line, very much thinking  
**[0:25:24-0:25:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:25:24):**  about the next 10, 15, 20 years with a lot of experiments in it to see what actually  
**[0:25:30-0:25:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:25:30):**  grows here because nobody knew.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:25:32):**  I think I remember a story from when we met is that the neighbors were saying, you can  
**[0:25:36-0:25:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:25:36):**  only grow olives here and sheep.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:25:39):**  And yet you're doing I don't know how many types of fruit plus 40 types of vegetables  
**[0:25:43-0:25:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:25:43):**  and a lot of other animals and sheep and the sheep are coming.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:25:46):**  So I find it fascinating, especially that this cash flow thinking but not being stuck  
**[0:25:51-0:25:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:25:51):**  in I have to be a tomato grower or I have to be a zucchini or a courgette grower or  
**[0:25:55-0:25:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:25:55):**  I have to be.  
**[0:25:56-0:26:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:25:56):**  No, I'm growing with the landscape, which is something I see with many farmers, interesting  
**[0:26:01-0:26:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:26:01):**  farmers or good farmers, even though obviously I cannot say somebody is a good or a bad farmer.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:26:07):**  So where do you see the farm going over?  
**[0:26:10-0:26:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:26:10):**  Where do you see this transition from vegetables?  
**[0:26:13-0:26:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:26:13):**  How many years are you still thinking about doing vegetables?  
**[0:26:15-0:26:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:26:15):**  Is that five?  
**[0:26:16-0:26:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:26:16):**  Is that 10 years?  
**[0:26:17-0:26:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:26:17):**  Is it three?  
**[0:26:18-0:26:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:26:18):**  Or is this, let's say the five or 10 year idea, I wouldn't call it vision, but idea  
**[0:26:24-0:26:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:26:24):**  and vision of we see the farms?  
**[0:26:26-0:26:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:26:26):**  The biggest problem is that I had to switch from a less landscape reading process based  
**[0:26:35-0:26:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:26:35):**  farm planning.  
**[0:26:37-0:26:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:26:37):**  I had to switch on something completely different because we were sort of obliged by the state  
**[0:26:45-0:26:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:26:45):**  and the local rules to take a completely different path because you have to reach a certain level  
**[0:26:53-0:27:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:26:53):**  of production in order to be seen as a farmer, not just by the neighbors, but also by actually  
**[0:27:01-0:27:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:27:01):**  who's the whole compartment of bureaucracy and low making machine.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:27:08):**  And basically haven't been working in the way we should have.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:27:14):**  And this is amazing because you could have the most amazing experience, the most amazing  
**[0:27:18-0:27:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:27:18):**  knowledge, but it's all relative location.  
**[0:27:21-0:27:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:27:21):**  But would that be, I hear you say the biggest barrier is local rules, bureaucracy that haven't  
**[0:27:31-0:27:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:27:31):**  been made for regenerative farmers.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:27:32):**  I mean, they weren't made in the mind, okay, let's go against this group.  
**[0:27:35-0:27:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:27:35):**  No, let's try to maintain a system that is very broken and let's put some rules around  
**[0:27:41-0:27:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:27:41):**  to at least somehow go against the worst effects of that.  
**[0:27:46-0:27:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:27:46):**  And they never thought that there would actually be a group to something completely different.  
**[0:27:50-0:27:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:27:50):**  But isn't that also part of the landscape reading?  
**[0:27:53-0:27:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:27:53):**  It is part of the landscape at the end.  
**[0:27:55-0:28:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:27:55):**  So somehow being very zen and it's part of your observation at the beginning, like what  
**[0:28:02-0:28:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:28:02):**  can I actually legally do here?  
**[0:28:04-0:28:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:28:04):**  Or what maybe changes in five to 10 years?  
**[0:28:06-0:28:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:28:06):**  Because I mean, we are in a flexible world as well, in a sense that some of these rules  
**[0:28:11-0:28:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:28:11):**  are actually changing, thanks to a lot of farmers like yourself that are lobbying.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:28:15):**  So is it fair to complain about that while it may be actually as part of the landscape?  
**[0:28:20-0:28:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:28:20):**  This is a very important insight and this connected to the self limiting nature of our  
**[0:28:27-0:28:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:28:27):**  enterprise.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:28:28):**  What it means this, we come from a capitalistic mindset where normally we grew up in a very  
**[0:28:36-0:28:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:28:36):**  clean society where we could get and we could have anything we wanted the fastest way possible,  
**[0:28:45-0:28:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:28:45):**  the cheapest way possible.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:28:48):**  And it's very important to switch from that mentality to a more nature based timing or  
**[0:28:56-0:29:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:28:56):**  pace of processes taking place and so on.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:29:01):**  So of course, what you say is connected really to we want to reach a certain result the fastest  
**[0:29:08-0:29:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:29:08):**  we want to show.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:29:09):**  We know that this is possible.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:29:11):**  We know that we think it's possible, but it's not because in the current context of laws  
**[0:29:15-0:29:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:29:15):**  and regulation, it's we almost trick ourselves to dream about it.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:29:19):**  You tell me, look at this landscape, this could do X, Y, Z.  
**[0:29:22-0:29:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:29:22):**  But actually, if you look at the local laws that are there for whatever reason, that's  
**[0:29:25-0:29:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:29:25):**  not the point of discussing that now.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:29:27):**  Actually you can't.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:29:28):**  If you cannot put sheep in that way, then you cannot put sheep in that way.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:29:32):**  It's useless to dream about it.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:29:34):**  But obviously we want to because we see like an untapped landscape or an underperforming  
**[0:29:39-0:29:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:29:39):**  ecosystem or underperforming landscape, which makes it very difficult.  
**[0:29:44-0:29:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:29:44):**  So what would you say, what's the biggest barrier for regenerative agriculture at the  
**[0:29:51-0:29:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:29:51):**  moment that you see?  
**[0:29:52-0:29:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:29:52):**  If you had to pick one, because for sure you have a list.  
**[0:29:55-0:30:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:29:55):**  I think it's what I said just before is recognizing that we have to deal with different types  
**[0:30:02-0:30:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:30:02):**  of mindsets.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:30:05):**  It has to be closer to an idea of eco-centrism rather than anthropocentrism.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:30:14):**  And this is why our idea is not our farm.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:30:19):**  It will probably become popular, at least in the Regenach movement, not because we wish  
**[0:30:30-0:30:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:30:30):**  or it's our will to reach popularity, but it will be by accident because our nature  
**[0:30:37-0:30:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:30:37):**  is getting more and more closer to a mindset, to an eco-centric mindset, which is automatically  
**[0:30:44-0:30:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:30:44):**  what is self-limiting yourself into not becoming the farm.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:30:51):**  Our idea is to experiment, to research, to make available information that will be used  
**[0:30:58-0:31:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:30:58):**  by many other farms that have to be able to start and to manage and to grow a farm like  
**[0:31:06-0:31:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:31:06):**  our or actually a much better one.  
**[0:31:09-0:31:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:31:09):**  It's pointless to me to have superheroes, it's pointless to me to have farm gurus, because  
**[0:31:16-0:31:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:31:16):**  it's not the reality.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:31:17):**  It's important, it makes people more enthusiastic, but I don't believe it's at the reach to a  
**[0:31:25-0:31:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:31:25):**  wider target of people.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:31:27):**  I think most of people like something at people level.  
**[0:31:34-0:31:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:31:34):**  You're doing a lot of courses throughout Italy, actually you're teaching a lot of courses,  
**[0:31:39-0:31:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:31:39):**  and hopefully soon with a few structures on the farm you'll be able to also do it on the  
**[0:31:44-0:31:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:31:44):**  farm here, which makes it more people level because you can point that what you actually  
**[0:31:49-0:31:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:31:49):**  have done instead of being on a farm of somebody else who could be amazing, but you don't know  
**[0:31:53-0:31:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:31:53):**  the framework and the decisions and their principles.  
**[0:31:57-0:31:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:31:57):**  What else do you see?  
**[0:31:58-0:32:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:31:58):**  I mean you do a bit online, Facebook and Instagram, I will definitely link them below, usually  
**[0:32:02-0:32:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:32:02):**  in Italian and English, which I think is very, very interesting.  
**[0:32:06-0:32:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:32:06):**  What do you see in the next years?  
**[0:32:08-0:32:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:32:08):**  If you would have a lot of time, which you don't, to do other things, what would you  
**[0:32:12-0:32:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:32:12):**  focus on?  
**[0:32:14-0:32:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:32:14):**  Definitely focusing more and more on the farm, because even if I think that courses and consultancies  
**[0:32:23-0:32:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:32:23):**  are extremely important, from what is my experience, to show people and farmers and customers and  
**[0:32:30-0:32:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:32:30):**  consumers what we are doing, what we are really doing, and they can touch it and they can  
**[0:32:38-0:32:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:32:38):**  connect with all the frustrations, all the energy that has been used in order to reach  
**[0:32:44-0:32:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:32:44):**  something apparently extremely simple, I think this is the most important thing.  
**[0:32:51-0:32:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:32:51):**  We don't want to create a farm based on appearance, on very beautiful aesthetic, I mean this is  
**[0:32:59-0:33:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:32:59):**  also very important, but it has to be a functional aesthetic.  
**[0:33:02-0:33:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:33:02):**  People don't have to wow just because something is different than what they are used to see,  
**[0:33:08-0:33:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:33:08):**  people, they have to, to me, they should be amazed about the connection of aesthetic to  
**[0:33:18-0:33:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:33:18):**  something that creates resonance in something that they maybe didn't even know, but it sounds  
**[0:33:25-0:33:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:33:25):**  logical, it sounds interesting, it sounds obvious to the eye of a person that is not  
**[0:33:33-0:33:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:33:33):**  judging something and is not expecting something.  
**[0:33:36-0:33:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:33:36):**  I would like to give to people, this I think is what I want really to give to people, what  
**[0:33:41-0:33:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:33:41):**  I had the chance to have when I was traveling, which is a complete freedom to experience  
**[0:33:49-0:33:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:33:49):**  a real reality, because we can't really keep on telling people what to do, what to think,  
**[0:33:58-0:34:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:33:58):**  what to read, what to eat, people have to understand themselves.  
**[0:34:03-0:34:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:34:03):**  Even when I tell people about free choice mineral or talking in a simpler way, when  
**[0:34:10-0:34:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:34:10):**  a cow needs a mineral, go and check for the rock or for the material that is reaching  
**[0:34:16-0:34:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:34:16):**  that mineral and leaks it and some people ask me, how do they know it?  
**[0:34:23-0:34:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:34:23):**  And I tell them, you know it too, it's just that you're not trained anymore or you think  
**[0:34:28-0:34:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:34:28):**  you can't do it anymore, but just by looking at the wine tasters and honey tasters and  
**[0:34:35-0:34:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:34:35):**  all the people working in the perfume industry, like how to use the nose should be the first,  
**[0:34:43-0:34:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:34:43):**  really one of the first courses that people should do if they want to understand more  
**[0:34:49-0:34:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:34:49):**  about the reality that surrounds them, because we are basically animals that use senses to  
**[0:34:54-0:34:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:34:54):**  perceive reality, but don't know how to use their senses.  
**[0:34:59-0:35:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:34:59):**  So I remember when I was in high school, we did a small course on wine tasting and what  
**[0:35:05-0:35:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:35:05):**  activated in me managing little by little to smell something that it was there, but  
**[0:35:12-0:35:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:35:12):**  I wasn't able to decode it.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:35:15):**  It really opens not just my capacity of smelling something more complex, but actually the understanding  
**[0:35:24-0:35:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:35:24):**  that we live in a reality which is complex, but we are living it in a simple way, is a  
**[0:35:30-0:35:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:35:30):**  stratification of simple insights that we have to become able to understand, to perceive  
**[0:35:39-0:35:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:35:39):**  through senses and then through experience.  
**[0:35:43-0:35:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:35:43):**  Just a note for my American listeners, we're in Italy and tasting wine at high school,  
**[0:35:48-0:35:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:35:48):**  let's say the later years of high school is quite common, so just to put everybody at  
**[0:35:55-0:35:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:35:55):**  ease.  
**[0:35:56-0:36:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:35:56):**  Let's keep it for a moment in Italy.  
**[0:36:00-0:36:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:36:00):**  What's your vision of where you would like regenerative agriculture to go?  
**[0:36:05-0:36:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:36:05):**  I think you know most of the farmers here in Italy that are somewhere on the path in  
**[0:36:10-0:36:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:36:10):**  transition.  
**[0:36:11-0:36:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:36:11):**  You've either seen them in your courses, you've either visited them, you've either worked  
**[0:36:14-0:36:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:36:14):**  with them as a consultant.  
**[0:36:16-0:36:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:36:16):**  I know you have some strong opinions on size and going fast and slow.  
**[0:36:22-0:36:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:36:22):**  Where would you like in an ideal world if it would be Matteo deciding with a magic wand  
**[0:36:27-0:36:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:36:27):**  to move the agriculture industry, let's keep it in this huge country, very diverse country,  
**[0:36:33-0:36:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:36:33):**  but I think it's a roadmap for others as well.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:36:36):**  Where would you like to see the ag and food space in Italy go?  
**[0:36:41-0:36:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:36:41):**  If we would make you agriculture minister or if you would have the control?  
**[0:36:46-0:36:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:36:46):**  Possibly one of the most complex tasks in this country because basically even known  
**[0:36:54-0:37:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:36:54):**  people that do not have any experience in farming will give their ideas about farming.  
**[0:37:06-0:37:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:37:06):**  If you are at a table with 10 people and there are two farmers, all of the 10 people will  
**[0:37:12-0:37:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:37:12):**  speak about farming.  
**[0:37:13-0:37:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:37:13):**  It's like football basically.  
**[0:37:14-0:37:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:37:14):**  It's like football.  
**[0:37:15-0:37:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:37:15):**  It's just like everybody knows or everybody thinks that they know.  
**[0:37:19-0:37:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:37:19):**  And we're now talking to somebody that knows a bit more, maybe doesn't know know as in  
**[0:37:23-0:37:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:37:23):**  know it all but knows definitely a lot more than the average people on the table.  
**[0:37:29-0:37:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:37:29):**  Where would you like to see it go?  
**[0:37:32-0:37:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:37:32):**  For me, the first thing, the most important thing to me is education through experience  
**[0:37:39-0:37:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:37:39):**  as I said before because if you create a tool, if you create a toy for a kid that will not  
**[0:37:48-0:37:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:37:48):**  be able to use the toy is useless.  
**[0:37:50-0:38:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:37:50):**  It's just connected to our, directly connected to our ego, to our needs, subjective need  
**[0:38:00-0:38:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:38:00):**  of creating something that we think is good for the others.  
**[0:38:04-0:38:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:38:04):**  First we have to understand the direction that education should take, education of everybody  
**[0:38:12-0:38:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:38:12):**  in order to have a population of consumers, of eaters, of people that require, that ask,  
**[0:38:20-0:38:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:38:20):**  that understand what these new visionary farmers are doing.  
**[0:38:27-0:38:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:38:27):**  Otherwise most of farmers will have to work double of their time and using double the  
**[0:38:34-0:38:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:38:34):**  energy to creating a sort of compatibility with the complexities that they are creating  
**[0:38:41-0:38:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:38:41):**  but that which is not understood by most of consumers.  
**[0:38:44-0:38:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:38:44):**  So first is education, education in schools, education of farmers, education to consumers  
**[0:38:50-0:38:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:38:50):**  associations through I think consumers association we can do a lot because there are very powerful  
**[0:38:56-0:39:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:38:56):**  associations in Italy and through them I think we can really reach a wider range, a wider  
**[0:39:02-0:39:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:39:02):**  target of people which don't even know what is regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:39:08-0:39:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:39:08):**  Many times they don't even know what is organic agriculture.  
**[0:39:12-0:39:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:39:12):**  So first is education of the future eaters, of the future consumers and then little by  
**[0:39:18-0:39:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:39:18):**  little is to understand especially for Italy, maybe I think of small farming because I grew  
**[0:39:25-0:39:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:39:25):**  up in Italy which is a country, one of the most diverse country from geographical, morphological,  
**[0:39:31-0:39:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:39:31):**  topographical point of view as well as social point of view is very important to understand  
**[0:39:40-0:39:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:39:40):**  the entity, every single entity of bio-regions, of areas and to reach the highest vicinity,  
**[0:39:53-0:40:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:39:53):**  to get the closest to observation and interaction with the natural systems in order to create  
**[0:40:02-0:40:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:40:02):**  planned design agricultural systems which are based on the efficiency of energy flow  
**[0:40:09-0:40:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:40:09):**  of local natural ecosystems but that of course need an outcome result which is food production,  
**[0:40:19-0:40:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:40:19):**  biomass, fiber, all the things that agriculture should provide.  
**[0:40:23-0:40:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:40:23):**  So it's much more complex work than creating models that can be applied on broad acre and  
**[0:40:32-0:40:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:40:32):**  I think if we really want to reach a high level of environmental regeneration and efficiency  
**[0:40:40-0:40:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:40:40):**  in the use of energy we really should look at smaller systems which are more complex  
**[0:40:49-0:40:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:40:49):**  because the nature of a small system most of the time is of a more complex system because  
**[0:40:57-0:40:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:40:57):**  it's normal.  
**[0:40:58-0:41:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:40:58):**  If you have a broad acre you will not observe as you observe a smaller piece of land.  
**[0:41:03-0:41:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:41:03):**  The machinery will be bigger, bigger is the machine, less precise is the machine.  
**[0:41:10-0:41:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:41:10):**  Smaller is the system, you will reach to a system which is managed by hands and hands  
**[0:41:16-0:41:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:41:16):**  are not machines, hands are nerves, it's something that interacts not in a bi-dimensional way  
**[0:41:26-0:41:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:41:26):**  but in a fourth dimensional way with the landscape.  
**[0:41:30-0:41:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:41:30):**  So I really see that we could go from broad acre systems towards a small acre system but  
**[0:41:40-0:41:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:41:40):**  I don't really know if it will be really possible to change what is the nature of landscape  
**[0:41:48-0:41:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:41:48):**  fragmentation which in Italy is one of the most important problems.  
**[0:41:52-0:42:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:41:52):**  I don't know if it will be easy to reorganize the landscape from a ecology point of view.  
**[0:42:02-0:42:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:42:02):**  Not just ecology but really who owns what and this probably is one of the most difficult  
**[0:42:11-0:42:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:42:11):**  things either in the broad acre agriculture but also when we are talking about small farms.  
**[0:42:20-0:42:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:42:20):**  So I don't know really what is the key.  
**[0:42:24-0:42:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:42:24):**  I see that the landscape should be the element that decides whether broad acre or small acre  
**[0:42:34-0:42:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:42:34):**  farming is the most appropriate thing to do.  
**[0:42:37-0:42:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:42:37):**  It's like for center possibly for certain places it would be more intelligent, more  
**[0:42:43-0:42:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:42:43):**  sensible to create and to work on efficient small farms, in other situations it would  
**[0:42:50-0:42:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:42:50):**  be the opposite.  
**[0:42:51-0:42:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:42:51):**  But again we go back to the landscape.  
**[0:42:54-0:42:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:42:54):**  We have to take time to find the tools to understand the landscape and we have to find  
**[0:42:59-0:43:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:42:59):**  the time to interact with the landscape using actively the experience which has been stored  
**[0:43:10-0:43:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:43:10):**  and stratified by the evolution of the natural ecosystems which is a huge book that is there  
**[0:43:18-0:43:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:43:18):**  for us and use it in order to take the closest path to the one that nature expects us to  
**[0:43:29-0:43:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:43:29):**  do.  
**[0:43:30-0:43:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:43:30):**  And I want to be conscious of your time as well to end with a slightly maybe provocative  
**[0:43:37-0:43:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:43:37):**  question but I would like to explain why I'm asking it, I think in the sector we need to  
**[0:43:42-0:43:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:43:42):**  start thinking about larger numbers, larger numbers of investments as I think many more  
**[0:43:49-0:43:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:43:49):**  are waking up to the potential of regenerative, from a soil perspective, climate perspective,  
**[0:43:54-0:43:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:43:54):**  water, healthcare, inequality, etc.  
**[0:43:57-0:44:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:43:57):**  And I think we're going to get quite an influx of people trying to get into the space and  
**[0:44:02-0:44:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:44:02):**  I would like you to imagine to be managing a portfolio of a billion dollars and I choose  
**[0:44:07-0:44:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:44:07):**  a ridiculous high number for a reason because I think there's going to be a lot of money  
**[0:44:10-0:44:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:44:10):**  flowing into the space and I think we need to start getting ready to absorb this.  
**[0:44:15-0:44:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:44:15):**  So if you would be tomorrow head of an investment fund or head of a portfolio of one billion  
**[0:44:21-0:44:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:44:21):**  dollars that has to be invested with different returns but invested not granted, what would  
**[0:44:27-0:44:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:44:27):**  you do?  
**[0:44:29-0:44:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:44:29):**  So after you get a heart attack after you check your bank account obviously.  
**[0:44:36-0:44:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:44:36):**  For sure the first thing as I said before I want to create the substrate, the base in  
**[0:44:42-0:44:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:44:42):**  order to multiply the potential of this billion of dollars and this means to me again to do  
**[0:44:53-0:45:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:44:53):**  education to prepare the mass to understand the change.  
**[0:45:00-0:45:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:45:00):**  This would be one of the first thing or one of the most important at the beginning and  
**[0:45:06-0:45:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:45:06):**  then connected to the bio-regional idea I would start many different pilot farms in  
**[0:45:15-0:45:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:45:15):**  many different bio-regions where research and functional research, functional experimentation  
**[0:45:24-0:45:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:45:24):**  should be taken very seriously in order to reach results that will help the farmers of  
**[0:45:32-0:45:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:45:32):**  that area where the pilot farm is to allow these farmers to modify, to renew their productive  
**[0:45:41-0:45:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:45:41):**  system towards a more regenerative regime in order to from one side decrease the costs  
**[0:45:49-0:45:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:45:49):**  of production, from the other side increase the quality of the produce that will be then  
**[0:45:56-0:46:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:45:56):**  flood will be floating the market and at the same time understanding how to create ecosystem  
**[0:46:05-0:46:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:46:05):**  services that will allow the whole bio-region to increase general health and general genetic  
**[0:46:16-0:46:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:46:16):**  potential of the living beings that are participating in order to live in that certain bio-region,  
**[0:46:26-0:46:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:46:26):**  that certain group of ecosystems.  
**[0:46:30-0:46:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:46:30):**  And together with this, this should be given a lot of importance to mechanization and the  
**[0:46:37-0:46:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:46:37):**  technology which should work on light simple functional machineries which will allow the  
**[0:46:45-0:46:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:46:45):**  soil and the farm and the agricultural world little by little to disconnect from what is  
**[0:46:56-0:47:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:46:56):**  the spiral of interest of the industry in keeping the farmers in their arms.  
**[0:47:03-0:47:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:47:03):**  So this is possibly the most complex thing, in fact a consistent amount of the investment  
**[0:47:11-0:47:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:47:11):**  should go in the direction of lobbying and new policy making that sees the farmer as  
**[0:47:18-0:47:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:47:18):**  the most important element of the human society and not the most important slave of the human  
**[0:47:26-0:47:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:47:26):**  society.  
**[0:47:28-0:47:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:47:28):**  And those have to be changed, modified, we have to create again a more rural based society  
**[0:47:39-0:47:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:47:39):**  because the energy we consume to survive in any of this form is basically coming from  
**[0:47:46-0:47:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:47:46):**  agriculture in one way or another.  
**[0:47:50-0:48:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:47:50):**  And I believe that turning forward a renewed complex interaction with the natural world  
**[0:48:02-0:48:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:48:02):**  is what is needed also to reestablish what it used to be or it has been in different  
**[0:48:10-0:48:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:48:10):**  very enlightened societies of the past where nature was the teacher of the human society  
**[0:48:18-0:48:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:48:18):**  and through complexity was creating complex beings, not simple beings that are just good  
**[0:48:25-0:48:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:48:25):**  in buying on the internet and filling a hole that has been drilled for them by basically  
**[0:48:33-0:48:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:48:33):**  the industry and the capitalistic world.  
**[0:48:38-0:48:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:48:38):**  So yeah I think when I say pilot projects, especially in Italy, I must admit that I don't  
**[0:48:47-0:48:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:48:47):**  know well the other countries, maybe I don't even know this country but from what I see  
**[0:48:52-0:48:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:48:52):**  from my experiences when I show something not with words but with facts, with results  
**[0:48:59-0:49:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:48:59):**  and with something that people can touch with their hands, I change the mind of people in  
**[0:49:05-0:49:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:49:05):**  seconds.  
**[0:49:07-0:49:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:49:07):**  Sometimes people come to me and ask me, you completely turned me upside down, things that  
**[0:49:13-0:49:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:49:13):**  I've been thinking for 50-60 years, in 10 minutes now you made them trembling and now  
**[0:49:21-0:49:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:49:21):**  I have to start to think about something else.  
**[0:49:25-0:49:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:49:25):**  But really of course it's thanks to my experience and so on but I think through showing people  
**[0:49:32-0:49:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:49:32):**  that you're doing something continuously, not really caring about energy consumption  
**[0:49:38-0:49:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:49:38):**  and frustration and difficulties and so on is what gives people from one side hope, from  
**[0:49:44-0:49:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:49:44):**  the other the possibility of really seeing something different.  
**[0:49:50-0:49:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:49:50):**  And a smart agriculture, a complex smart agriculture is very subtle, it's interesting because what  
**[0:49:58-0:50:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:49:58):**  it does, it activates multiple effects that don't touch just the natural kingdom and the  
**[0:50:08-0:50:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:50:08):**  ecological kingdom but a certain type of agriculture will activate positively the regeneration  
**[0:50:18-0:50:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:50:18):**  of society, of the economics and all the aspects that inhabit our existence.  
**[0:50:27-0:50:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:50:27):**  So through agriculture really we have a huge potential of destroying, destruction and simplification  
**[0:50:36-0:50:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:50:36):**  of our own reality at the same time of a very important potential of complexifying from  
**[0:50:47-0:50:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:50:47):**  a functional point of view and regenerating what are all the kingdoms that create our  
**[0:50:57-0:50:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:50:57):**  reality.  
**[0:50:59-0:51:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:50:59):**  There's so much to unpack there, I think we can do this for hours but we're going to do  
**[0:51:03-0:51:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:51:03):**  that in another episode, I promise Matteo will be back.  
**[0:51:07-0:51:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:51:07):**  I think agriculture is the perfect Trojan horse to change a lot of things in our society  
**[0:51:12-0:51:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:51:12):**  and it's probably the biggest leverage point we have so I will definitely check in with  
**[0:51:19-0:51:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:51:19):**  you again, I will follow you as you're heading this one billion dollar investment fund anytime

**[0:51:25-0:51:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:51:25):**  If somebody has that lying around definitely give Matteo a call and I want to thank you

**[0:54:08-0:54:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:54:08):**  It's currently a series of 17 videos mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  
**[0:54:15-0:54:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:54:15):**  so you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:54:17-0:54:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:54:17):**  We're gonna look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:54:22-0:54:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:54:22):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:54:27-0:54:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:54:27):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[0:54:32-0:54:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:54:32):**  if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:54:33-0:54:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:54:33):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:54:38-0:54:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:54:38):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:54:42-0:54:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:54:42):**  We're gonna look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:54:47-0:54:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:54:47):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:54:48-0:54:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:54:48):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:54:50-0:54:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:54:50):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:54:53-0:54:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:54:53):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:54:56-0:54:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:54:56):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:54:58-0:55:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/28/matteo-mazzola/#t=0:54:58):**  Before making any investment please find professional investment advice.

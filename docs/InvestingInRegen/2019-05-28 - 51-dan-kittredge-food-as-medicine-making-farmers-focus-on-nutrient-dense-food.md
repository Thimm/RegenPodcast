**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:00:14):**  This interview is about quality, nutrient density and flavor of food and their connection  
**[0:00:18-0:00:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:00:18):**  with soil health and human health.  
**[0:00:20-0:00:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:00:20):**  I think it's safe to say that if Dan and the team at the Bionutrient Food Association  
**[0:00:24-0:00:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:00:24):**  get it right, they will change the entire food and agriculture sector for the better.  
**[0:00:31-0:00:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:00:31):**  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture, investing as if  
**[0:00:36-0:00:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:00:36):**  the planet mattered.  
**[0:00:37-0:00:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:00:37):**  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:00:41-0:00:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:00:41):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:00:47-0:00:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:00:47):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:51-0:00:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:00:51):**  Why my focus on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:53-0:00:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:00:53):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:00:57-0:01:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:00:57):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:00-0:01:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:01:00):**  And it's time that we as investors, big and small and consumers start paying much more  
**[0:01:05-0:01:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:01:05):**  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:09-0:01:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:01:09):**  In March last year, we launched our Patreon community to make it easy for fans to support

**[0:01:33-0:01:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:01:33):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:01:35):**  Welcome to another episode of the podcast.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:01:36):**  I'm Kool Mosein, your host.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:01:38):**  And today interview Dan Kittredge, organic farmer, founder of the Bio-nutrient Food Association,  
**[0:01:43-0:01:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:01:43):**  working hard to demonstrate the connections between plant health, soil health, carbon  
**[0:01:47-0:01:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:01:47):**  sequestration, crop nutrition value, flavor and human health.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:01:51):**  Welcome Dan.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:01:52):**  Thank you for having me.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:01:53):**  And to start with a personal question, why soil?  
**[0:01:57-0:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:01:57):**  Why the real food campaign, which we will dive deeper into what brought you to the place  
**[0:02:02-0:02:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:02:02):**  where you are now as a founder of the Bio-nutrient Food Association?  
**[0:02:06-0:02:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:02:06):**  Very long question and long answer, obviously, but let's try to keep it short.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:02:11):**  Potentially that's a long answer.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:02:13):**  In short, my background as an organic farmer, growing up on an organic farm and also having  
**[0:02:18-0:02:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:02:18):**  my parents run an organic farming organization, gave me perspective when I tried to set off  
**[0:02:25-0:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:02:25):**  and have my own farm about how much I knew and didn't know about how to make a living  
**[0:02:31-0:02:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:02:31):**  farming.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:02:32):**  A lot of this work started from a very practical standpoint, which was the techniques and principles  
**[0:02:39-0:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:02:39):**  that I had been trained in were not sufficient to produce healthy plants.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:02:44):**  And if your plants are sick, your cost of production is high and you have a hard time  
**[0:02:48-0:02:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:02:48):**  making a living.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:02:49):**  So I started just very pragmatically on how to produce plants that are more healthy by  
**[0:02:57-0:03:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:02:57):**  attending conferences and seminars, reading books, and in short order found that I was  
**[0:03:03-0:03:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:03:03):**  able to, without much changing of what I was doing, deeper understanding, really profoundly  
**[0:03:10-0:03:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:03:10):**  affect the health of my plants, which correlated with better yields, better pest and disease  
**[0:03:15-0:03:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:03:15):**  resistance and better economic viability.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:03:19):**  And as I got into it further, the connections between soil building, carbon sequestration,  
**[0:03:25-0:03:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:03:25):**  flavor aroma, shelf life, human health, all seemed to be tied intimately into this same  
**[0:03:33-0:03:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:03:33):**  deeper understanding.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:03:34):**  And so I started to give workshops at conferences and then courses and then this functionally  
**[0:03:41-0:03:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:03:41):**  evolved into this Bio-Nutrient Food Association, the organization which I'm executive director  
**[0:03:46-0:03:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:03:46):**  of.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:03:47):**  And so over the past 10 years we have built an organization that's primarily based in  
**[0:03:51-0:03:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:03:51):**  North America, although we have plenty of allies globally.  
**[0:03:55-0:03:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:03:55):**  We've got local chapters in about 15 different states and a couple provinces in Canada.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:03:59):**  We do an annual conference.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:04:01):**  We do two-day intensive seminars.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:04:03):**  And we've been working for quite some time now in helping farmers understand better how  
**[0:04:08-0:04:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:04:08):**  to work with nature.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:04:11):**  Our basic idea is that plants have evolved to grow and the more we can manage our soils  
**[0:04:18-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:04:18):**  in a fashion so that the plants are able to do what they've evolved to do, the better  
**[0:04:23-0:04:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:04:23):**  it is for everybody involved.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:04:25):**  So a short introduction perhaps.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:04:27):**  Yeah, but a lot to unpack there actually.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:04:30):**  So your starting point was really organic or growing up an organic farm and being an  
**[0:04:35-0:04:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:04:35):**  organic farmer.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:04:36):**  But you took it and are still taking it to a whole new level.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:04:40):**  Does that simply mean that organic isn't good enough or was it the missing focus on  
**[0:04:47-0:04:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:04:47):**  plant health for instance?  
**[0:04:49-0:04:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:04:49):**  What was the main starting point of that journey that you found?  
**[0:04:53-0:04:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:04:53):**  It's not economically viable.  
**[0:04:54-0:04:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:04:54):**  There has to be more because many see organic as already quite radical and you're actually  
**[0:04:58-0:05:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:04:58):**  going quite some steps beyond that.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:05:01):**  Well, yeah, I like all of these terms, Christian or Democrat or Republican, depending on your  
**[0:05:10-0:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:05:10):**  framework.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:05:12):**  It's a very broad community.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:05:15):**  There's a bunch of different kinds of organic farmers, etc. and different understandings.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:05:21):**  But I think a deeper understanding of how life works has not been part of the organic  
**[0:05:30-0:05:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:05:30):**  understanding.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:05:32):**  We have, through our organization, tried to really tease out the wisdom from the organic  
**[0:05:37-0:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:05:37):**  community as well as from the permaculture community and the agroecology, from biodynamics,  
**[0:05:43-0:05:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:05:43):**  from conventional agriculture.  
**[0:05:45-0:05:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:05:45):**  Our thought is that life is actually what's going on here and we have these different  
**[0:05:51-0:05:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:05:51):**  modes of understanding and working with it.  
**[0:05:53-0:06:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:05:53):**  But let's be more integrated in our understanding and let's have there be some practical modes  
**[0:06:01-0:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:06:01):**  of assessment of success.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:06:03):**  For one, I think if a crop is being attacked by a flesh eating fungus, that's usually a  
**[0:06:09-0:06:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:06:09):**  sign of poor health.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:06:10):**  Let's acknowledge that and say we may have organically approved fungicides but that does  
**[0:06:15-0:06:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:06:15):**  not mean that we're producing high quality food.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:06:18):**  It just means we're not using certain synthetic chemicals.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:06:22):**  So the conclusion we've come to after a number of years is that really the nutritional value  
**[0:06:28-0:06:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:06:28):**  of the food is what matters.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:06:30):**  The flavor, the aroma, the nutritional value correlates with the health of the person that  
**[0:06:35-0:06:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:06:35):**  eats it, the health of the plant, the health of the soil and the ecosystem.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:06:40):**  So that would be a point around which we could potentially come together.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:06:46):**  Just to sort of jump ahead a little bit, we've done some research now and sampled crops from  
**[0:06:51-0:06:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:06:51):**  around the US and looked at some of these nutritional compounds.  
**[0:06:55-0:07:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:06:55):**  One of them, polyphenols, it's a family of compounds that correlate with sort of cancer  
**[0:07:02-0:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:07:02):**  healing and things like that.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:07:05):**  In our research last year, we sampled 600 carats from around the country, different  
**[0:07:10-0:07:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:07:10):**  stores, farmers markets, farms, organic, conventional and the nutritional variation in polyphenols  
**[0:07:17-0:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:07:17):**  was 20,000%.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:07:21):**  This is not a small number.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:07:23):**  There is a massive nutritional variation in food which correlates to the health of the  
**[0:07:28-0:07:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:07:28):**  plant, correlates to the health of the human that eats it.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:07:31):**  And so we're not saying organic is bad or conventional is bad or biodynamics is bad.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:07:35):**  We're saying let's integrate the wisdom from these different communities and let us be  
**[0:07:40-0:07:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:07:40):**  assessed by the actual health of the food we produce and let that be the real marker,  
**[0:07:46-0:07:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:07:46):**  not the label or the marketing scheme.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:07:48):**  Which is, I mean, it makes obviously a ton of sense.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:07:51):**  Let's focus on the quality of the food.  
**[0:07:53-0:07:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:07:53):**  What does it need to do?  
**[0:07:54-0:07:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:07:54):**  It needs to nourish you.  
**[0:07:56-0:07:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:07:56):**  So we need to look at nutrients.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:07:58):**  But it's also a very, I wouldn't say new thought, but contradictory because you don't have certifications  
**[0:08:05-0:08:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:08:05):**  for that.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:08:06):**  We finally have organic and everybody starts to know it and starts to double digit growth  
**[0:08:11-0:08:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:08:11):**  in the supermarkets, et cetera.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:08:13):**  With the Real Food Campaign and the Bio-Nutrient Food Association on the issues of quality,  
**[0:08:18-0:08:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:08:18):**  was there or is there a standard of quality or that had to be completely developed of  
**[0:08:24-0:08:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:08:24):**  what we actually mean by good food?  
**[0:08:26-0:08:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:08:26):**  Well, the Real Food Campaign is this collaborative project that we are helping to establish,  
**[0:08:34-0:08:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:08:34):**  which is working with different universities, organizations, companies, et cetera, to do  
**[0:08:41-0:08:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:08:41):**  three basic things.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:08:42):**  One is to build a tool that a consumer can use to test quality in real time, as in flash  
**[0:08:49-0:08:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:08:49):**  a light like a smartphone camera flash at a carrot and then get a reading out which  
**[0:08:54-0:08:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:08:54):**  says relatively how good this is.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:08:57):**  So build a tool that can do that is one thing that no one's done yet, which we've got the  
**[0:09:03-0:09:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:09:03):**  first generation of it out already.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:09:05):**  The second step is to identify the variation in quality.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:09:08):**  And to your question, there does not seem to be any database anywhere globally that  
**[0:09:15-0:09:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:09:15):**  I've been able to find at least in 10, 12 years of looking and asking people who would  
**[0:09:19-0:09:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:09:19):**  know there's no database which identifies the variation in nutrient levels within a  
**[0:09:24-0:09:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:09:24):**  crop.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:09:25):**  So this carrot relative to that carrot, et cetera.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:09:29):**  And so that's what we're, to your question, we're working on is populating that database  
**[0:09:35-0:09:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:09:35):**  so that we can begin to say something intelligent about relatively how good this carrot is versus  
**[0:09:40-0:09:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:09:40):**  that carrot.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:09:41):**  There's a third step to the campaign, a third leg of the stool as it were, which is what  
**[0:09:46-0:09:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:09:46):**  are the environmental conditions, which management practices, which soil types, fertility programs,  
**[0:09:53-0:09:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:09:53):**  varieties of crops, microbiome dynamics, what are the environmental conditions which cause  
**[0:09:59-0:10:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:09:59):**  which quality results.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:10:02):**  And so our long term hope is to be able to give growers the ability to shift their management  
**[0:10:08-0:10:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:10:08):**  practices during the growing season based on this information so that we can functionally  
**[0:10:14-0:10:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:10:14):**  increase the nutrient value of food across the board, whether it's organic or local or  
**[0:10:19-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:10:19):**  biodynamic or whatever.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:10:22):**  We want to support growers globally of all scales in producing food that's more nutritious  
**[0:10:28-0:10:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:10:28):**  because of the profound impacts it can have on human health and environmental health.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:10:34):**  We can sequester all the carbon we need to bring CO2 levels back to where they were 250  
**[0:10:40-0:10:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:10:40):**  years ago.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:10:42):**  If we did agriculture well, we can do that in 10 years.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:10:45):**  If globally farmers started to manage their soils in such a manner as to be producing  
**[0:10:50-0:10:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:10:50):**  crops that were really quite nutritious, a side benefit of that is massive drawdown of  
**[0:10:57-0:10:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:10:57):**  carbon from the atmosphere into the soil.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:10:59):**  So yeah, the campaign is focused on the logistics of supporting consumers in purchasing food  
**[0:11:08-0:11:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:11:08):**  that's more nutritious.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:11:09):**  And we think that economic driver of consumers choosing the food that's most nutritious for  
**[0:11:14-0:11:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:11:14):**  them will inspire farmers to do a better job producing crops that are more nutritious.  
**[0:11:20-0:11:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:11:20):**  I may have jumped ahead.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:11:21):**  No, no, absolutely a key point, because you're saying that connection has already been shown  
**[0:11:28-0:11:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:11:28):**  between nutrient dense food or food that's more nutritious and soil health and dust soil  
**[0:11:35-0:11:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:11:35):**  carbon.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:11:36):**  Like there's no way to cheat that or to set up a very fancy greenhouse or vertical farm.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:11:42):**  Is that a rock solid connection?  
**[0:11:44-0:11:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:11:44):**  Like we know if this is a very nutritious carrot, that had to be grown in a very healthy  
**[0:11:49-0:11:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:11:49):**  soil?  
**[0:11:50-0:11:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:11:50):**  I'm sure there are ways with hydroponic systems to produce carrots that are much more nutritious  
**[0:11:57-0:11:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:11:57):**  than what's on the shelf right now.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:11:59):**  But if money is a factor, if cost of production is a piece of the puzzle, we'll never be able  
**[0:12:06-0:12:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:12:06):**  to do it as economically as with collaboration with microbes in the soil.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:12:11):**  That is the most efficient way to produce crops that are highly nutritious.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:12:16):**  If it would be an honest market system, the consumer and then there's obviously consumer  
**[0:12:21-0:12:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:12:21):**  that wants certain things, but the consumer pooling and asking and demanding nutrient  
**[0:12:26-0:12:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:12:26):**  dense carrot or nutrient dense food in general would be a very, very strong trigger for growers  
**[0:12:31-0:12:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:12:31):**  and farmers that I think already in many cases, I mean, the ones that attend your conferences  
**[0:12:36-0:12:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:12:36):**  and your sessions and your courses want to grow more nutrition than food.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:12:41):**  But at the moment, they have no way of distinguishing themselves from the next guy or girl on the  
**[0:12:47-0:12:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:12:47):**  farmer's market with carrots that look exactly the same, but are maybe completely different.  
**[0:12:52-0:12:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:12:52):**  That's what you're saying.  
**[0:12:53-0:12:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:12:53):**  Yes.  
**[0:12:54-0:13:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:12:54):**  And foundationally, there's this, it seems to be an assumption, an unquestioned assumption  
**[0:13:00-0:13:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:13:00):**  in the general public, which is that all food is basically the same, that all carrots have  
**[0:13:05-0:13:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:13:05):**  the same thing in them, that all milk has the same thing in it, etc.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:13:09):**  It's basically uniform, like plastic or steel.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:13:13):**  It's one thing.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:13:14):**  It's a uniform material and that is just absolutely not true.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:13:18):**  And so that, you know, there's a major hurdle there in telling the story, explaining the  
**[0:13:25-0:13:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:13:25):**  fact that this variation exists.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:13:27):**  But then if that story is told, the corollary of it is that there's a direct connection  
**[0:13:32-0:13:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:13:32):**  between the nutritional value of the food that you eat and your parents ate and your  
**[0:13:35-0:13:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:13:35):**  grandparents ate and the diseases that you're suffering or your children perhaps are suffering.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:13:43):**  We have epidemic levels of chronic illness anywhere where the food supply chain has gone  
**[0:13:49-0:13:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:13:49):**  towards a quote unquote Western diet.  
**[0:13:52-0:13:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:13:52):**  And it has a massive amount to do with the fact that we're able to mass produce food,  
**[0:13:57-0:14:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:13:57):**  but it is nutritionally quite devoid.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:14:00):**  And so that's what most of us have been eating now for a couple of generations, maybe not  
**[0:14:04-0:14:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:14:04):**  in more rural areas, but at least here in North America, for a couple of generations,  
**[0:14:10-0:14:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:14:10):**  we've been eating food that is devoid of nutrition and we are physiologically falling apart.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:14:15):**  And so while I think that the climate angle is important, I think the visceral self interest  
**[0:14:21-0:14:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:14:21):**  of your child is sick and a really good way to help your child not be sick anymore is  
**[0:14:26-0:14:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:14:26):**  to feed your child food that is most nutritious.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:14:30):**  If the cost of production is lower because you're working with nature, then it doesn't  
**[0:14:34-0:14:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:14:34):**  have to be more expensive for the consumer.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:14:37):**  So yeah, we think that there's a really significant opportunity here if we can engage some transparency  
**[0:14:43-0:14:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:14:43):**  and some, you know, deeper understanding to rapidly shift a lot of these issues which  
**[0:14:50-0:14:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:14:50):**  seem to be quite serious globally.  
**[0:14:51-0:14:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:14:51):**  If you think about it, it's ridiculous.  
**[0:14:55-0:14:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:14:55):**  We're pushing for clean labels, et cetera, but it still says tomatoes.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:14:59):**  And maybe if you're lucky, I mean, I live in a country or spend a lot of time in a country  
**[0:15:03-0:15:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:15:03):**  where at least the type of tomatoes is mentioned, but that still doesn't say anything about  
**[0:15:09-0:15:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:15:09):**  the nutritional value.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:15:10):**  And even if it would be slightly more expensive, but an additional value would be double, you  
**[0:15:15-0:15:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:15:15):**  could argue that it's a much cheaper product.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:15:18):**  And probably I think you're right in terms of the pool factor of healthcare versus carbon  
**[0:15:25-0:15:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:15:25):**  sequestration, et cetera.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:15:26):**  That's just much, much stronger, the healthcare part, and carbon will ever be unless you live  
**[0:15:32-0:15:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:15:32):**  on an island that's about to disappear under the sea.  
**[0:15:35-0:15:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:15:35):**  There is a lot of consternation in people's minds right now, a lot of concern about the  
**[0:15:40-0:15:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:15:40):**  climate, which is good.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:15:42):**  It's about time.  
**[0:15:44-0:15:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:15:44):**  But I don't think people are really going to stop driving cars and flying airplanes.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:15:47):**  And as far as I'm concerned, we don't have to.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:15:51):**  All you have to do is choose the food off the shelf that is more nutritious than the  
**[0:15:56-0:15:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:15:56):**  one next to it.  
**[0:15:57-0:16:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:15:57):**  Do you have two choices of carrots to purchase, two choices of oranges, two choices of beef  
**[0:16:01-0:16:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:16:01):**  or milk or rice or three or four?  
**[0:16:05-0:16:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:16:05):**  Well, all we're saying is if you choose the one that's more nutritious, you can functionally  
**[0:16:10-0:16:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:16:10):**  help reverse climate change.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:16:12):**  Yes, that's a nice corollary, but what you're really doing is healing yourself.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:16:17):**  And I think it's a good story.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:16:19):**  I think it's an absolutely brilliant story, very strong.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:16:23):**  I think the whole regeneration piece of yourself plus the land that you're supporting by eating  
**[0:16:27-0:16:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:16:27):**  it is probably going to be one of the main stories of this century.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:16:30):**  But I have a but.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:16:32):**  Do you see like in a supermarket in, let's say, the United States, if you choose one  
**[0:16:38-0:16:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:16:38):**  orange over another one, is there already enough supply of nutrient dense ones or are  
**[0:16:44-0:16:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:16:44):**  most of them relatively the same?  
**[0:16:47-0:16:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:16:47):**  What have you seen so far or is it too early to answer the question?  
**[0:16:50-0:16:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:16:50):**  Is there enough choice for me if I walk into a random place where I normally buy my food?  
**[0:16:55-0:16:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:16:55):**  There is significant variation.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:16:58):**  I gave you the number 20,000%.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:17:01):**  That's the full variation that we found.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:17:04):**  But within any grocery store, there's easily 100% or 200% variation within the crops that  
**[0:17:09-0:17:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:17:09):**  are available.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:17:10):**  They may all still be relatively poor.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:17:13):**  They likely are still relatively poor.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:17:15):**  If you think of a carrot, the most nutritious carrot is 100 and something that's basically  
**[0:17:22-0:17:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:17:22):**  empty is one.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:17:24):**  Most carrots are between 15 and 35.  
**[0:17:28-0:17:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:17:28):**  That's where they're at.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:17:29):**  Or maybe it's 8 and 15.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:17:32):**  They're relatively low but there is still a significant variation.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:17:36):**  Our thought is that this is going to be an evolutionary process whereby people start  
**[0:17:41-0:17:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:17:41):**  buying the 30s and start leaving the 15s on the shelf and then the people that are growing  
**[0:17:46-0:17:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:17:46):**  15s realize they have to up their game.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:17:48):**  They start to produce 35s and 40s and then their crops start to move off the shelf and  
**[0:17:53-0:17:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:17:53):**  then the people who are doing 30s start to up their game and get to 50.  
**[0:17:57-0:18:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:17:57):**  Our thought is this is a competition to the top.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:18:00):**  If we can establish a visceral economic incentive to inspire people to compete to do better,  
**[0:18:08-0:18:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:18:08):**  then we have succeeded.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:18:10):**  It will be an evolutionary evolving iterative process but that's our understanding of how  
**[0:18:16-0:18:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:18:16):**  it could work.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:18:17):**  Stay Forever And where are you now?  
**[0:18:18-0:18:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:18:18):**  We're in April 2019.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:18:21):**  You described the campaign and we shortly touched upon the Bio-Nutrient Food Association.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:18:27):**  What does your week look like or your month?  
**[0:18:29-0:18:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:18:29):**  What's the main thing at the moment in this huge evolution because this is a long, long-term  
**[0:18:33-0:18:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:18:33):**  process and it's been a long time in the making?  
**[0:18:36-0:18:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:18:36):**  What's keeping you busy?  
**[0:18:37-0:18:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:18:37):**  What are you working on at the moment?  
**[0:18:39-0:18:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:18:39):**  What I'm working on at the moment actually is a pre-order campaign for the first generation  
**[0:18:45-0:18:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:18:45):**  of really consumer-built mass-produced calibrated spectrometers.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:18:51):**  We expect to be putting that out.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:18:53):**  We have tools right now which are quite functional.  
**[0:18:56-0:18:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:18:56):**  Yeah, I actually ordered one.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:18:58):**  It should come in in the next few weeks.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:19:00):**  Maybe when this is out, it already came in and I started playing with it and sharing  
**[0:19:03-0:19:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:19:03):**  data but I would definitely annoy anybody with that thing when it gets in.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:19:08):**  Some people like things like that and will play around and do experiments and stuff but  
**[0:19:13-0:19:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:19:13):**  our thought is for the consumer, it should be as simple and easy as possible.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:19:17):**  The version we have right now is not that.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:19:20):**  The version we have now is for tinkerers and researchers and sort of activists.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:19:27):**  We will be launching next month this campaign for pre-order of this consumer calibrated  
**[0:19:32-0:19:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:19:32):**  tool.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:19:33):**  We're aiming for 10,000 units as our first serious batch.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:19:37):**  We're going to be promising that it will be available in two years although I think likely  
**[0:19:43-0:19:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:19:43):**  it will be less time than that but we would rather be conservative than over promise.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:19:49):**  As an anecdote, we have a large supermarket chain in the US called Whole Foods which is  
**[0:19:56-0:20:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:19:56):**  associated with being a little bit more upscale, organic, etc.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:20:02):**  A number of years ago when I was talking to one of the regional buyers for Whole Foods  
**[0:20:07-0:20:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:20:07):**  for the northeast corner of the US about this project and this opportunity, I said, wouldn't  
**[0:20:13-0:20:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:20:13):**  you like to be part of this project because then you can show that your stuff is better  
**[0:20:16-0:20:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:20:16):**  than your competition.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:20:17):**  They said, no, really we don't want to have any empiricals on what's going on.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:20:26):**  However, when you are two years from the consumers being able to tell how good our stuff is,  
**[0:20:32-0:20:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:20:32):**  please come tell us because then we'll give our growers two years to meet standard.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:20:37):**  It's an interesting dynamic.  
**[0:20:38-0:20:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:20:38):**  That's about now, right?  
**[0:20:40-0:20:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:20:40):**  Let's give them a fair warning.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:20:42):**  That's what we're going to do next month is launch this and say, okay, heads up supply  
**[0:20:46-0:20:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:20:46):**  chain, here we are, this is what we're doing.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:20:48):**  At this trajectory in two years, consumers will be able to test the variation of quality  
**[0:20:53-0:20:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:20:53):**  at the grocery store, in the farmers market, in real time.  
**[0:20:56-0:21:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:20:56):**  Just to give an idea, that's a little like pocket size spectrometer that you can point  
**[0:21:01-0:21:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:21:01):**  at a carrot and tells you that what you were saying before between one and a hundred or  
**[0:21:06-0:21:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:21:06):**  whatever the spectrum will be, tells you the nutrient density.  
**[0:21:11-0:21:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:21:11):**  It'll probably be the size of a deck of playing cards and will probably connect to your, a  
**[0:21:18-0:21:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:21:18):**  little tether, a little cord, like earbuds cord.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:21:22):**  And so, yeah, it'll be, I don't know what that size is in centimetres.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:21:27):**  It's probably three inches by, you know, two inches by one inch or something.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:21:31):**  It will be small.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:21:32):**  Yeah, that's small.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:21:33):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:21:34):**  And like any app, you know, you press the button on your phone to take the picture and  
**[0:21:39-0:21:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:21:39):**  the, you know, the answer pops up on your phone right there.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:21:42):**  So it's quite exciting.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:21:44):**  And our hope is that we've already gotten interest from various industries like blueberries  
**[0:21:52-0:21:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:21:52):**  and coffee and milk and things like that.  
**[0:21:55-0:21:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:21:55):**  Companies that are involved in that, in those, in producing those crops.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:21:59):**  Our thought is that we want to work with the farmers and the supply chain companies to  
**[0:22:05-0:22:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:22:05):**  help them improve the quality of the crops they're producing so that when the consumers  
**[0:22:10-0:22:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:22:10):**  can have this tool, that their stuff looks better.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:22:13):**  And just for my idea, in terms of milk and coffee, would I be pointing it at the bottle  
**[0:22:18-0:22:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:22:18):**  of milk?  
**[0:22:19-0:22:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:22:19):**  Would I be pointing it at the cup of coffee or would I be pointing it at the beans?  
**[0:22:23-0:22:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:22:23):**  How would it work?  
**[0:22:24-0:22:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:22:24):**  Well, with the coffee people, we were talking about all the way up to the farmers and the  
**[0:22:28-0:22:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:22:28):**  mountains and wherever it is, Peru or India that are growing it.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:22:34):**  Really, at the farmers level, wow.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:22:36):**  So they could flash a leaf while the coffee bush is growing and understand how to support  
**[0:22:44-0:22:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:22:44):**  the plant in being healthier.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:22:45):**  And then the buyers would flash the light at the raw bean and choose which beans to  
**[0:22:51-0:22:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:22:51):**  purchase at what price all the way through.  
**[0:22:53-0:22:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:22:53):**  So yeah, it's a, I mean, there's all kinds of opportunities here.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:22:58):**  There is naturally going to be a consumer tool which will give you relatively how good  
**[0:23:03-0:23:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:23:03):**  this is.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:23:04):**  And then there's going to be a business grade tool which will be more expensive, which would  
**[0:23:08-0:23:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:23:08):**  give specific levels of specific compounds and elements.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:23:13):**  Extremely, extremely interesting.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:23:14):**  Yeah, let's shift gears a bit to the finance side or the investor or the impact investor  
**[0:23:19-0:23:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:23:19):**  side of things as this podcast is listened by them as well.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:23:23):**  What would be, I mean, you've mostly been working on, I mean, actually on the business  
**[0:23:26-0:23:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:23:26):**  side and on the growing side, what does all this, this real food campaign and the focus  
**[0:23:32-0:23:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:23:32):**  on the quality of the food, what does it mean for investors that are maybe already invested  
**[0:23:37-0:23:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:23:37):**  actually in agriculture and food or are looking at that and want to basically unlock the potential  
**[0:23:43-0:23:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:23:43):**  impact?  
**[0:23:44-0:23:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:23:44):**  What does this movement mean for them?  
**[0:23:46-0:23:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:23:46):**  Well, I guess it depends on where they're invested.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:23:50):**  We expect that there will be a, this will be fairly disruptive to the food supply chain.  
**[0:23:56-0:23:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:23:56):**  I can't imagine.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:23:59):**  And we're doing this based on the data.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:24:02):**  We're not trying to be evangelical about saying we have the answer.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:24:07):**  We're saying this is what the data tells us.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:24:10):**  So our thought is that farmers are going to be able to understand how to grow crops more  
**[0:24:16-0:24:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:24:16):**  well, which is not, which means they're not going to be using synthetic fertilizers and  
**[0:24:22-0:24:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:24:22):**  toxic chemicals.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:24:24):**  You cannot produce high quality food while you're killing life.  
**[0:24:31-0:24:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:24:31):**  It just doesn't work well that way.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:24:32):**  So we expect a profound shift in the production of food and the, you know, which genetics,  
**[0:24:40-0:24:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:24:40):**  which of the varieties of crops have a better inherent potential to produce nutrient to  
**[0:24:45-0:24:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:24:45):**  food.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:24:46):**  A lot of the seed that's been hybridized and genetically modified is not been bred for  
**[0:24:52-0:24:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:24:52):**  nutritive value.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:24:53):**  In fact, many of the old open pollinated heirloom varieties of crops are the ones that have  
**[0:24:58-0:25:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:24:58):**  a better inherent potential there.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:25:00):**  So from fertility to seed to genetics, we're working with a company called General Mills  
**[0:25:07-0:25:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:25:07):**  here in the, in the U S which makes Cheerios and they've been doing market research and  
**[0:25:14-0:25:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:25:14):**  the mothers of fathers who buy the Cheerios for the children would like to know that their  
**[0:25:19-0:25:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:25:19):**  Cheerios are nutritious.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:25:20):**  So General Mills wants to know what are the practices by which oats are grown more well  
**[0:25:26-0:25:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:25:26):**  so that they can put on a label that their Cheerios are more nutritious than the competition.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:25:30):**  So if you think about that whole supply chain and market dynamic, we expect significant  
**[0:25:37-0:25:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:25:37):**  shifts when you pick the tomatoes on ripe like they do in this country and then ship  
**[0:25:43-0:25:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:25:43):**  them and then, you know, gas them with ethylene and then they turn a reddish color.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:25:49):**  When you pick a crop on ripe, it doesn't have in it the full suite of nutrients that it  
**[0:25:54-0:25:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:25:54):**  could have.  
**[0:25:55-0:25:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:25:55):**  And so our thought is that the, you know, the mass production of agriculture is going  
**[0:25:59-0:26:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:25:59):**  to be more difficult that, that farmers who are picking things, you know, more locally  
**[0:26:05-0:26:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:26:05):**  in a growing in a more of a polyculture dynamic, I mean, are going to be out competing the  
**[0:26:10-0:26:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:26:10):**  ones that are growing in the monocultures and picking raw and things like that.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:26:14):**  It's an absolute massive ripple effect.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:26:17):**  Obviously, if we start, if we start selecting for qualities and we start selecting for flavor,  
**[0:26:22-0:26:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:26:22):**  which sounds ridiculous that we didn't, but we did not because we had to produce as many  
**[0:26:27-0:26:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:26:27):**  calories as possible, at least in Europe, the thought after the second world war, just  
**[0:26:32-0:26:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:26:32):**  never hunger again.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:26:33):**  And we managed to do that, but it came at an enormous cost to everything else basically.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:26:39):**  But I don't think we can underestimate how big of a shift this potentially could be.  
**[0:26:44-0:26:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:26:44):**  I don't think you are underestimating it, but it's, it's good to remind the listeners  
**[0:26:49-0:26:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:26:49):**  to that.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:26:50):**  There's other corollaries, you know, ecosystem services, the carbon markets, there's with  
**[0:26:57-0:27:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:26:57):**  the data we're collecting and the hardware we're building, will have the ability to actually  
**[0:27:02-0:27:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:27:02):**  monetize that carbon sequestration.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:27:05):**  We were talking to a known, which is I think is a European company, you know, after the  
**[0:27:10-0:27:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:27:10):**  Paris climate accords, they made a commitment to be carbon neutral.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:27:14):**  And so they were looking at all of the aspects of their supply chain and understanding that  
**[0:27:18-0:27:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:27:18):**  when cows are eating grass, they're actually carbon neutral or carbon negative.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:27:24):**  They're functionally sequestering carbon.  
**[0:27:26-0:27:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:27:26):**  But when cows are eating grain, they're not.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:27:29):**  They're causing increased carbon in the atmosphere.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:27:31):**  So there's that whole vector, as far as I'm concerned, you know, the revolution in health  
**[0:27:35-0:27:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:27:35):**  care is going to be profound.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:27:37):**  We know from our indigenous traditional wisdom, the role of medicinal plants or herbs and  
**[0:27:45-0:27:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:27:45):**  things like that.  
**[0:27:46-0:27:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:27:46):**  You know, I think it was Hippocrates, the father of Western medicine, who said, let  
**[0:27:48-0:27:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:27:48):**  food be thy medicine.  
**[0:27:50-0:27:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:27:50):**  You know, we have correlated that the data exists to show these mineral deficiencies,  
**[0:27:56-0:28:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:27:56):**  these nutrient deficiencies correlate with these chronic illnesses, cancer, heart disease,  
**[0:28:02-0:28:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:28:02):**  etc.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:28:03):**  So we're going to be able to prescribe food to people to help systemically heal these  
**[0:28:09-0:28:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:28:09):**  ailments, which are now just managed by the sort of the major health care system.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:28:15):**  So, yeah, I would expect a dramatic decrease in the need for pharmaceuticals in medical  
**[0:28:20-0:28:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:28:20):**  devices, etc.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:28:22):**  The implications are quite exciting, actually.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:28:26):**  Really exciting.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:28:27):**  And again, I'm going to repeat myself.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:28:29):**  I'm very excited for this device.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:28:31):**  The first version, I know it's the developer kit, which means it's going to have some tinkering  
**[0:28:36-0:28:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:28:36):**  needed, etc.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:28:37):**  But I'm very excited what it means for me personally, but also in work, etc.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:28:43):**  What kind of pushback do you get?  
**[0:28:45-0:28:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:28:45):**  Because it, I mean, you're disrupting or in the process of disrupting some very powerful  
**[0:28:51-0:28:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:28:51):**  industries that have been built over the last years to basically go against completely what  
**[0:28:56-0:28:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:28:56):**  we're talking about here.  
**[0:28:57-0:29:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:28:57):**  If you want to share, if you can share, have you had a lot of pushback?  
**[0:29:00-0:29:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:29:00):**  Have you had a strong, I mean, I remember interviewing such a top three party in from  
**[0:29:06-0:29:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:29:06):**  India disrupting on the zero budget, natural farming in one of the regions there and getting  
**[0:29:12-0:29:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:29:12):**  a lot of pushback from the fertilizer industry and the subsidized fertilized industry, obviously.  
**[0:29:17-0:29:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:29:17):**  But he was standing up to that.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:29:19):**  What have you been getting through over the last 12 years?  
**[0:29:22-0:29:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:29:22):**  And now that you're actually getting up to steam and not even getting support from Whole  
**[0:29:26-0:29:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:29:26):**  Foods, how has been the journey?  
**[0:29:28-0:29:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:29:28):**  Well, I would say that we have not experienced much resistance.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:29:33):**  There have been people such as yourself who said, boy, you should be worried about your  
**[0:29:38-0:29:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:29:38):**  safety.  
**[0:29:39-0:29:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:29:39):**  But our strategy is to work with anybody who wants to work with us.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:29:43):**  We're not opposed to Monsanto.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:29:46):**  You know, they've got an amazing global supply chain.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:29:48):**  And if they want to understand the data that we're collecting and support farmers in producing  
**[0:29:56-0:29:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:29:56):**  better crops, so be it.  
**[0:29:58-0:29:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:29:58):**  Let them.  
**[0:29:59-0:30:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:29:59):**  We need to transition agriculture globally in short order.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:30:02):**  So we're not against anybody.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:30:05):**  We're for life and for vitality.  
**[0:30:07-0:30:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:30:07):**  And we're happy to work with anybody who wants to engage.  
**[0:30:12-0:30:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:30:12):**  I think to a large degree, we're pretty small.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:30:15):**  We haven't made a lot of noise in social media, etc.  
**[0:30:18-0:30:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:30:18):**  You're right, because everybody I talk to is like, does that exist?  
**[0:30:21-0:30:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:30:21):**  I said, no, it's coming.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:30:23):**  A lot of people haven't seen or followed your work, I think, until the last six months or  
**[0:30:31-0:30:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:30:31):**  so.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:30:32):**  I haven't seen it popping up in many, many places.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:30:34):**  Yeah.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:30:35):**  Which maybe has been good in this case.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:30:36):**  I think, you know, speak softly and carry a large stick was, you know, I think Teddy  
**[0:30:42-0:30:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:30:42):**  Roosevelt, one of our presidents, was one of his mottos.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:30:45):**  You know, let's not talk a lot about what we're doing.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:30:48):**  Let's do it.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:30:49):**  And it is a bit of a paradigm shift.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:30:51):**  It is a bit of a of an entirely different way of looking at things.  
**[0:30:55-0:31:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:30:55):**  And when you've got the current model that's invested in a certain perspective and we're  
**[0:31:02-0:31:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:31:02):**  coming at things from a really different perspective, they can't even see us.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:31:05):**  I don't think they can't even see what we're up to because we just don't register in their  
**[0:31:10-0:31:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:31:10):**  field.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:31:11):**  You're not even on their competitive list or threat list.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:31:14):**  You're off the radar.  
**[0:31:16-0:31:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:31:16):**  It's a concept that I haven't even identified as a potential issue.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:31:21):**  So, you know, and I tell people publicly, like, you know, I'm happy to work with anybody  
**[0:31:26-0:31:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:31:26):**  who wants to work with us in understanding what causes better quality.  
**[0:31:30-0:31:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:31:30):**  And there's going to be a need for all number of businesses to support this process.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:31:37):**  There's going to be a bunch of people getting quite rich that are especially the early adopters  
**[0:31:41-0:31:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:31:41):**  in it.  
**[0:31:42-0:31:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:31:42):**  So, yeah, I think our strategy of a being willing to collaborate with anyone and be  
**[0:31:48-0:31:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:31:48):**  you just being coming from such a different perspective has successfully, at least thus  
**[0:31:53-0:31:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:31:53):**  far prevented any serious resistance.  
**[0:31:57-0:31:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:31:57):**  That's very good to hear.  
**[0:31:58-0:32:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:31:58):**  And I want to be conscious of your time and end with with a final question, which usually  
**[0:32:02-0:32:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:32:02):**  gets into two or three final questions.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:32:04):**  If you could give advice to you and imagine there's a room for, like, let's say, a theater  
**[0:32:10-0:32:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:32:10):**  full of smart impact investors, at least we all consider ourselves smart listening to  
**[0:32:15-0:32:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:32:15):**  this podcast and they have read about soil, the potential of carbon retro down.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:32:20):**  They've followed some of the innovative farmers on the region X side, and they would like  
**[0:32:25-0:32:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:32:25):**  to put some of their money or maybe all of their money to work.  
**[0:32:29-0:32:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:32:29):**  And without giving them investment advice, what would be your first step for them if  
**[0:32:34-0:32:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:32:34):**  they want to get started in really understanding the agriculture space and being part of this?  
**[0:32:40-0:32:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:32:40):**  I wouldn't say a small transition, but a gigantic transition that you're basically pushing.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:32:45):**  You know, I'm biased.  
**[0:32:48-0:32:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:32:48):**  Everybody is.  
**[0:32:49-0:32:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:32:49):**  And I have a I've got a I'm with that caveat.  
**[0:32:53-0:33:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:32:53):**  I think that what we're doing is quite revolutionary and engaging with our organization of our  
**[0:33:01-0:33:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:33:01):**  data collection with our, you know, our process is going to empower people regardless of whether  
**[0:33:07-0:33:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:33:07):**  at the supply chain in being leaders in the near future.  
**[0:33:12-0:33:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:33:12):**  So we're doing the data collection necessary to really identify what the cost of dynamics  
**[0:33:18-0:33:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:33:18):**  are that correlate with better quality.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:33:19):**  So anybody who's working with us to engage in data collection is going to know more than  
**[0:33:25-0:33:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:33:25):**  their competitors.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:33:26):**  They'll be more well established and in success.  
**[0:33:30-0:33:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:33:30):**  You know, if you're in the supply chain and you're in your purchasing crops and you're  
**[0:33:34-0:33:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:33:34):**  processing them, etc., working with us to help understand the variation so that you  
**[0:33:39-0:33:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:33:39):**  can choose which crops are better means that you're going to be well positioned when the  
**[0:33:43-0:33:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:33:43):**  when this whole thing hits.  
**[0:33:45-0:33:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:33:45):**  So I don't know.  
**[0:33:47-0:33:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:33:47):**  I mean, I don't I don't travel in those investor funder worlds very much.  
**[0:33:52-0:33:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:33:52):**  I don't I don't know where the plays are, as it were, in purchasing land and revitalizing  
**[0:33:57-0:34:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:33:57):**  already existing plantations, etc.  
**[0:34:00-0:34:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:34:00):**  I would welcome conversation with anybody who's interested.  
**[0:34:04-0:34:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:34:04):**  I'd be happy to come in and speak to a group of people in Milan or wherever who are who  
**[0:34:08-0:34:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:34:08):**  are interested.  
**[0:34:09-0:34:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:34:09):**  I think that there's a you know, we are a an NGO, a nonprofit educational organization.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:34:15):**  Everything we're doing is in the commons, which means it can't be controlled or owned.  
**[0:34:20-0:34:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:34:20):**  So the engineering for the tool, the algorithm for the definition of quality, the app, the  
**[0:34:26-0:34:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:34:26):**  data set, all that stuff is in the commons.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:34:31):**  And until it's properly built and fleshed out, what I'm talking about can't occur.  
**[0:34:37-0:34:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:34:37):**  So we need actually those social impact investors.  
**[0:34:42-0:34:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:34:42):**  They're a small amount of money from them could profoundly move this process forward.  
**[0:34:46-0:34:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:34:46):**  Yeah, I would even imagine it would just speed it up.  
**[0:34:49-0:34:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:34:49):**  I mean, it's happening anyway.  
**[0:34:51-0:34:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:34:51):**  Your trade, the train has left the station and is moving.  
**[0:34:54-0:34:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:34:54):**  And speed is important here.  
**[0:34:57-0:34:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:34:57):**  At some point, it's going to start happening quite rapidly.  
**[0:34:59-0:35:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:34:59):**  And the people engage the ground level are going to be positioned ahead of the competition.  
**[0:35:04-0:35:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:35:04):**  So yeah, I don't know much about a good enough answer.  
**[0:35:08-0:35:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:35:08):**  But absolutely, no, definitely, I think engage the data collection, the engaging in organization,  
**[0:35:13-0:35:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:35:13):**  depending on where you are, and what you can and want to do.  
**[0:35:18-0:35:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:35:18):**  And I think that the push and the asking questions around quality and around management and those  
**[0:35:23-0:35:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:35:23):**  correlations is something that we don't do often enough anyway.  
**[0:35:27-0:35:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:35:27):**  And we often think tomatoes are tomatoes or carrots are carrots.  
**[0:35:31-0:35:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:35:31):**  And to ask the final question, if you could change one thing in the agriculture and food  
**[0:35:36-0:35:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:35:36):**  industry, if you could wave your magic wand and tomorrow morning, we will wake up and  
**[0:35:39-0:35:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:35:39):**  that thing has changed, what would it be?  
**[0:35:41-0:35:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:35:41):**  I think it's what I'm working on.  
**[0:35:45-0:35:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:35:45):**  If I could ask for anything to change tomorrow, I'll wave my magic wand, it would be that  
**[0:35:50-0:35:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:35:50):**  there's an understanding of variation in food quality, that food is not uniform.  
**[0:35:56-0:36:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:35:56):**  If we understood the variation and the implications of it, all the rest of these shifts would  
**[0:36:01-0:36:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:36:01):**  follow would flow very naturally.

**[0:39:10-0:39:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:39:10):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture

**[0:39:32-0:39:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:39:32):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[0:39:36-0:39:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:39:36):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  
**[0:39:41-0:39:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:39:41):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:39:42-0:39:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:39:42):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:39:44-0:39:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:39:44):**  Unfortunately, that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:39:46-0:39:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:39:46):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:39:50-0:39:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/29/dan-kittredge/#t=0:39:50):**  It's also not investment advice.

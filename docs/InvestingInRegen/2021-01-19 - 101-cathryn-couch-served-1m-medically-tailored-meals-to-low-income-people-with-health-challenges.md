**[0:00:12-0:00:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:00:13):**  Food is medicine but could also be poison says our guest who has served over 1 million  
**[0:00:18-0:00:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:00:18):**  organic medically tailored meals to low income people struggling because of a health challenge.  
**[0:00:23-0:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:00:23):**  We talk about food as medicine a lot but we usually discuss ways of measuring nutrient  
**[0:00:26-0:00:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:00:26):**  density, soil health etc. but we hardly cover the medical side of things.  
**[0:00:31-0:00:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:00:31):**  Who is mostly at risk of chronic illness are the people who can't afford a healthy meal  
**[0:00:35-0:00:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:00:35):**  to begin with.  
**[0:00:37-0:00:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:00:37):**  So how do we make food as medicine part of every medical discussion and how do we bring  
**[0:00:41-0:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:00:41):**  soil health into that conversation as well?  
**[0:00:44-0:00:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:00:44):**  Our guest of today is showing that it's a much better investment to provide someone  
**[0:00:48-0:00:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:00:48):**  healthy food than to deal with the effects of cheap processed food later, like a very  
**[0:00:53-0:00:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:00:53):**  expensive readmission in a hospital.  
**[0:00:57-0:01:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:00:57):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture, Investing as if the  
**[0:01:02-0:01:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:01:02):**  Planet Mattered, a podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and  
**[0:01:06-0:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:01:06):**  agriculture space to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil,  
**[0:01:11-0:01:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:01:11):**  people, local communities and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:01:17):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:19-0:01:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:01:19):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:23-0:01:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:01:23):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat and it's time that we as investors, big and small  
**[0:01:28-0:01:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:01:28):**  and consumers, start paying much more attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:01:35):**  In March last year we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support

**[0:01:59-0:02:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:01:59):**  Thank you.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:02:00):**  Welcome to another episode today with Catherine Couch.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:02:04):**  She's the founder and CEO of Ceres Community Project, a nonprofit working to foster health  
**[0:02:08-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:02:08):**  by connecting people to one another and to healthier food system.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:02:12):**  Ceres provides 185,000 organic medically tailored meals and we're going to ask what that actually  
**[0:02:17-0:02:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:02:17):**  is annually to low income people who are struggling because of a health challenge.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:02:21):**  Youth volunteers grow the food and prepare the meals as part of youth development, culinary  
**[0:02:26-0:02:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:02:26):**  and food system education program.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:02:28):**  Welcome Catherine.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:02:29):**  Thank you.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:02:30):**  Great to be with you.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:02:31):**  So to start with a personal question, how did you end up focusing on medically tailored  
**[0:02:35-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:02:35):**  meals?  
**[0:02:37-0:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:02:37):**  Background in food, background in soil, background in egg.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:02:39):**  What was the journey to this very specific part of the food system?  
**[0:02:42-0:02:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:02:42):**  Yeah.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:02:43):**  So I actually have a business degree, a master's in business and started my career in marketing  
**[0:02:48-0:02:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:02:48):**  and marketing research, but I've always had a really big interest in food and health.  
**[0:02:53-0:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:02:53):**  And in the late eighties, I ended up as the communications director for a national nonprofit  
**[0:02:58-0:03:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:02:58):**  called the hunger project that was working on educating Americans about the solutions  
**[0:03:03-0:03:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:03:03):**  to global hunger.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:03:05):**  And then in the early nineties, after I left the hunger project, I started a home delivered,  
**[0:03:09-0:03:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:03:09):**  a vegetarian organic home delivered meal service.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:03:13):**  And it's really hard to remember back then because literally there was like two vegetarian  
**[0:03:18-0:03:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:03:18):**  restaurants in the Bay area.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:03:20):**  Organic food was still pretty ugly and very hard to find.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:03:23):**  And there were no meal delivery services.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:03:25):**  I mean, it's just like, it's so radically different now.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:03:28):**  For anybody listening that cannot imagine that that's not so long ago and it was like  
**[0:03:31-0:03:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:03:31):**  that.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:03:32):**  Yeah.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:03:33):**  Yeah, no, it's like, we've got so many options now, right?  
**[0:03:35-0:03:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:03:35):**  And every grocery store has prepared meals.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:03:37):**  I mean, it's such a radically different environment.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:03:39):**  And I ran that for 10 years and then I was doing some catering and some other things.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:03:44):**  And what happened is in 2006, a mom that I knew asked me to teach her daughter how to  
**[0:03:50-0:03:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:03:50):**  cook over the summer and hire her.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:03:53):**  And it's hard to hire someone for a catering gig who doesn't know how to cook.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:03:57):**  And so I was kind of annoyed by this request.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:04:00):**  And ultimately I ended up putting together a project in 2006 where this teen and I met  
**[0:04:06-0:04:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:04:06):**  once a week for seven weeks and I found three families that were going through a health  
**[0:04:10-0:04:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:04:10):**  crisis and we prepared meals for them.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:04:13):**  One of them was a mom with stage four metastasized breast cancer and two preteens, 11 and 13.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:04:21):**  And the first week that we cooked, the dad and that family came to pick up the meals  
**[0:04:25-0:04:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:04:25):**  and I introduced myself and Megan and I started talking to him about what we had made.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:04:30):**  And literally you could physically see the relief in his being that someone was doing  
**[0:04:37-0:04:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:04:37):**  something to relieve stress for him and his family.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:04:42):**  And at the same moment I glanced over at Megan and she looked about six inches taller.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:04:47):**  There was this moment where she realized that this wasn't about chopping onions.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:04:51):**  It was making that kind of difference in someone else's life.  
**[0:04:54-0:04:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:04:54):**  And that moment came and went.  
**[0:04:56-0:05:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:04:56):**  But three weeks later I woke up at six 30 in the morning and I literally had a download  
**[0:05:01-0:05:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:05:01):**  of what this opportunity was to connect two things that I felt really deeply about.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:05:07):**  One was the fact that so many young people today are growing up in families where cooking  
**[0:05:12-0:05:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:05:12):**  does not happen and family dinner does not happen.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:05:15):**  And so that fundamental life skill, right?  
**[0:05:18-0:05:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:05:18):**  The ability to prepare a healthy meal for oneself and one's family that I essentially  
**[0:05:23-0:05:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:05:23):**  learned by osmosis because cooking happened in my family three times a day was not happening  
**[0:05:29-0:05:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:05:29):**  for so many kids.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:05:30):**  And that really puts them and their future families at risk from a food system that is  
**[0:05:36-0:05:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:05:36):**  profit driven and does not really care about their health.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:05:39):**  And so that was really exciting to me.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:05:41):**  And then at the same time to know that when people are sick and they most need to eat  
**[0:05:47-0:05:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:05:47):**  healthy food, it tends to go to the bottom of the list for a whole host of reasons.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:05:53):**  It felt like the exciting thing for me at that moment was we could address both of these  
**[0:05:57-0:05:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:05:57):**  things in one solution.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:05:59):**  So that was the seed.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:06:00):**  And I ended up starting series in March 2007 with six teens in a church kitchen providing  
**[0:06:07-0:06:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:06:07):**  meals for four families.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:06:08):**  We've now provided over a million meals.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:06:10):**  We've trained a dozen communities around the US and now in Denmark to replicate our model.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:06:15):**  And more importantly, I've now gotten into the policy space and really food is medicine.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:06:19):**  So it's been a journey, but over the last five years, we've moved more and more to this  
**[0:06:23-0:06:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:06:23):**  medically tailored meal model.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:06:25):**  So we always did 100% organic food.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:06:27):**  We've always done really healthy meals, no added sugar.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:06:30):**  Yeah.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:06:31):**  But what is a medical tailored meal?  
**[0:06:33-0:06:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:06:33):**  It doesn't sound tasty, but I know it is.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:06:36):**  So walk us through like a typical, I mean, it's a policy term.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:06:39):**  Yeah.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:06:40):**  What is the medical tailored meal?  
**[0:06:41-0:06:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:06:41):**  Yeah.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:06:42):**  I mean, so we've always done really healthy food, 100% whole grain, organic, no added  
**[0:06:46-0:06:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:06:46):**  sugars, all that.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:06:48):**  But as we move more and more into working with people, especially with a range of chronic  
**[0:06:53-0:07:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:06:53):**  health conditions, if you look at low income populations, diabetes, heart disease, hypertension  
**[0:07:00-0:07:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:07:00):**  are really prevalent.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:07:02):**  And many of those patients have multiple of those illnesses.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:07:05):**  We started to realize that our meals needed to be more than just healthy.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:07:10):**  They needed to really take into account the specific health conditions that a patient  
**[0:07:15-0:07:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:07:15):**  was dealing with.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:07:16):**  So for example, for someone with diabetes, it's really important that you control the  
**[0:07:21-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:07:21):**  number of grams of carbs in each meal and they need to be pretty consistent.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:07:26):**  So for example, one of the things that we found was a lot of our vegetarian meals had  
**[0:07:31-0:07:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:07:31):**  too many carbs for a diabetic patient.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:07:33):**  So we had to start making adjustments.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:07:35):**  Same thing with heart disease.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:07:36):**  You have to control for sodium and you have to control for saturated fat in order for  
**[0:07:41-0:07:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:07:41):**  that meal to truly be as healthy as it needs to be for that patient.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:07:46):**  So if you have someone with congestive heart failure who comes home from the hospital and  
**[0:07:50-0:07:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:07:50):**  they eat high sodium meals, regardless of how healthy everything else is, they're going  
**[0:07:55-0:07:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:07:55):**  to retain water and that's going to put pressure on their heart and they're going to end up  
**[0:07:58-0:08:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:07:58):**  back in the emergency room.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:08:00):**  It's a higher level of understanding that for people with health conditions, you have  
**[0:08:05-0:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:08:05):**  to really take into account the specific nutritional needs of that patient and tailor the meals  
**[0:08:11-0:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:08:11):**  to meet that.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:08:12):**  So currently our basic diet meets what's called the DASH diet standards for cardiovascular  
**[0:08:17-0:08:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:08:17):**  disease and then we tailor for diabetes and also for chronic kidney disease.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:08:22):**  The basic diet is good for most people.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:08:25):**  It's saturated fat controlled, sodium controlled, reasonable amount of carbs.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:08:30):**  Certainly for anyone with cancer, most illnesses, that's going to be fine.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:08:33):**  But if you have chronic kidney disease or diabetes, you're going to need something else.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:08:37):**  And we currently actually don't serve people with renal failure because that diet is really  
**[0:08:41-0:08:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:08:41):**  complicated and we're not ready yet to take that on.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:08:44):**  So it's that next level of nutrition and understanding and matching the meal to the specific patient  
**[0:08:51-0:08:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:08:51):**  and their needs.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:08:52):**  And what makes you different because you said we're 100% organic, we really focus on the  
**[0:08:55-0:08:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:08:55):**  health side of things.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:08:57):**  You sort of imagine that because you're not the only one providing these medical tailored  
**[0:09:02-0:09:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:09:02):**  meals, they're mostly funded through state programs or they're government funded, it's  
**[0:09:07-0:09:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:09:07):**  not the participants itself.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:09:09):**  You would imagine that the others also focus on providing healthy meals.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:09:13):**  But in our previous conversation, you did highlight that probably that's not the case.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:09:18):**  I don't understand why are they not focusing on the healthy side of things?  
**[0:09:22-0:09:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:09:22):**  Is it really true like highly processed meals ends up your client, your partner into the  
**[0:09:27-0:09:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:09:27):**  hospital probably a lot earlier?  
**[0:09:29-0:09:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:09:29):**  What's going on there in terms of the healthy versus the non-healthy medical tailored meals?  
**[0:09:34-0:09:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:09:34):**  Because that means that medical tailored meals is actually not very good for you from a medical  
**[0:09:38-0:09:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:09:38):**  perspective.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:09:39):**  So I think that's my way to start answering this question.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:09:42):**  I want to make a point that so when we talk about food quality, it means a lot of different  
**[0:09:49-0:09:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:09:49):**  things depending what hat you have on.  
**[0:09:54-0:09:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:09:54):**  So when a registered dietitian nutritionist talks about food quality for someone with  
**[0:09:58-0:10:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:09:58):**  diabetes, they're talking about the specific nutrients in that meal.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:10:04):**  They're talking about how many grams of carbs, how many grams of protein, how many milligrams  
**[0:10:08-0:10:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:10:08):**  of sodium.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:10:09):**  They're not talking about how much nutrition is in the carrots or the soil or is that food  
**[0:10:16-0:10:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:10:16):**  organic.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:10:17):**  And that's how we get introduced through then Kittredge introduced us that you have to talk  
**[0:10:20-0:10:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:10:20):**  about food as medicine because Catherine is going beyond the carrot, like not saying you  
**[0:10:25-0:10:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:10:25):**  should eat more carrots, which for many people is already amazing first step.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:10:30):**  But unless we go beyond eat more veggies, eat your veggies, eat this quantity wise,  
**[0:10:35-0:10:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:10:35):**  we need to start looking at the whole system behind it.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:10:37):**  And I think that organic is an amazing start and you've sort of consciously or unconsciously  
**[0:10:42-0:10:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:10:42):**  made that decision.  
**[0:10:43-0:10:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:10:43):**  And now you're being pulled into the regenerative X space basically and looking at food and  
**[0:10:46-0:10:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:10:46):**  medicine speaking at the Bionutrient Food Association events.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:10:50):**  And it's like, what do you see there happening when you put your own head on?  
**[0:10:54-0:10:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:10:54):**  What do you think, what do you see as food quality?  
**[0:10:56-0:11:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:10:56):**  So I want to just go back and say that medically tailored meals in the United States started  
**[0:11:02-0:11:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:11:02):**  during the AIDS epidemic.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:11:04):**  So during the AIDS crisis in the late eighties and early nineties, individual organizations  
**[0:11:09-0:11:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:11:09):**  sprung up around the country.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:11:11):**  You know, AIDS patients were dying of the disease.  
**[0:11:14-0:11:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:11:14):**  In many cases, their families were abandoning them because they were gay and individual  
**[0:11:19-0:11:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:11:19):**  people like I did with my organization started nonprofits to provide meals to people with  
**[0:11:24-0:11:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:11:24):**  AIDS and HIV.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:11:26):**  And a lot of that focus was in the beginning on just comfort, right?  
**[0:11:31-0:11:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:11:31):**  And so there wasn't a sense of food quality.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:11:33):**  When meals started to get better, one of the things that happened was they learned really  
**[0:11:36-0:11:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:11:36):**  early on when AIDS patients have high quality medically tailored meals, their nutrition  
**[0:11:42-0:11:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:11:42):**  improves and their viral loads actually go down and they're less able to transmit the  
**[0:11:48-0:11:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:11:48):**  AIDS virus.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:11:50):**  So they learned that really early on and that led to the federal government including home  
**[0:11:55-0:12:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:11:55):**  delivered medically tailored meals as a covered benefit in the Ryan White Act, which is still  
**[0:12:00-0:12:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:12:00):**  the federal funding stream in the US for AIDS HIV.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:12:04):**  So that Ryan White funding supported dozens of nonprofits around the country in developing  
**[0:12:10-0:12:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:12:10):**  medically tailored meal programs.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:12:12):**  Then the AIDS crisis really changed.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:12:13):**  It became much more of a chronic illness.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:12:15):**  The need was different.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:12:16):**  And essentially what happened was Avon and Komen who were working with breast cancer  
**[0:12:21-0:12:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:12:21):**  patients came to those organizations and said, if we provided funding to you, would you serve  
**[0:12:27-0:12:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:12:27):**  breast cancer patients?  
**[0:12:28-0:12:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:12:28):**  And so it went from there and now most of these nonprofits who really developed the  
**[0:12:34-0:12:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:12:34):**  medically tailored meal model provide meals to people all over the country.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:12:38):**  We have funded that almost exclusively with philanthropic dollars until just recently.  
**[0:12:44-0:12:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:12:44):**  And now this group of organizations called the Food is Medicine Coalition in the US are  
**[0:12:49-0:12:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:12:49):**  really leading the work to integrate medically tailored meals into public and private insurance  
**[0:12:54-0:12:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:12:54):**  as a covered benefit.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:12:56):**  So I just want to clarify that like there's not a lot of government funding or even private  
**[0:13:01-0:13:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:13:01):**  health and it's starting to happen now.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:13:03):**  And as medically tailored meals have taken off and there started to be healthcare dollars  
**[0:13:10-0:13:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:13:10):**  becoming available for them, no surprise, many for-profits have also gotten into the  
**[0:13:15-0:13:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:13:15):**  space, right?  
**[0:13:16-0:13:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:13:16):**  So large for-profits are developing medically tailored meal models.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:13:20):**  There are companies now that will drop ship meals anywhere in the country for a certain  
**[0:13:25-0:13:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:13:25):**  amount of money.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:13:26):**  And for the most part, while their meals meet those nutritional requirements that I talked  
**[0:13:32-0:13:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:13:32):**  about, they do not have any focus on food quality in the way that we would talk about  
**[0:13:38-0:13:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:13:38):**  it.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:13:39):**  So how that food is grown, how that food is sourced, even things like whole grain, additives,  
**[0:13:44-0:13:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:13:44):**  you know, all of that stuff, they tend to be pretty poor quality meals.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:13:49):**  But for a health insurer, if I can sign up with one company, get a meal shipped anywhere  
**[0:13:55-0:14:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:13:55):**  in the country to my clients for $7.50 a meal, that sounds like a really good deal, right?  
**[0:14:02-0:14:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:14:02):**  And it's nutritionally appropriate.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:14:04):**  So this is where we have to start challenging the conversation.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:14:08):**  Among my colleagues that do this work, we are the only 100% organic provider, but everyone  
**[0:14:14-0:14:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:14:14):**  is making meals from scratch, is sourcing some organic food, is thinking about whole  
**[0:14:20-0:14:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:14:20):**  grains versus not whole grains, is trying to buy locally.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:14:24):**  Like they're moving in that direction.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:14:26):**  And I want to say, you know, every company and organization has its legacy history that  
**[0:14:31-0:14:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:14:31):**  it takes a while to move.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:14:32):**  I was lucky.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:14:33):**  I started with a focus on organic.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:14:35):**  My board and my funders supported that.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:14:38):**  And so it's all good to go.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:14:40):**  But if you've had a different model, it takes time to change that.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:14:43):**  But I think, you know, what I was saying to you earlier is that one of the challenges  
**[0:14:48-0:14:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:14:48):**  here is that we're trying to bring medically tailored meals into the healthcare space.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:14:53):**  We're trying to connect the dots between our food system and the way that we fund food  
**[0:14:59-0:15:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:14:59):**  programs in the U.S. and healthcare and trying to make the point that if we underfund food,  
**[0:15:06-0:15:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:15:06):**  we end up essentially paying for it on the healthcare side.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:15:09):**  We have to start connecting the dots between those two and understanding that food is the  
**[0:15:14-0:15:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:15:14):**  first line of defense against illness.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:15:17):**  You know, I often will say if every child started kindergarten in a school where they  
**[0:15:23-0:15:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:15:23):**  had a school garden integrated into their classroom, they learned about nutrition and  
**[0:15:27-0:15:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:15:27):**  they had access to really healthy meals from preschool all the way through, we could change  
**[0:15:32-0:15:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:15:32):**  the chronic disease trajectory in a generation.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:15:34):**  It is not complicated.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:15:36):**  But there's a lot of misinformation.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:15:38):**  And for many people in most countries who are low income, the ability to access the  
**[0:15:43-0:15:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:15:43):**  kind of quality food that you need to be well is very, very difficult.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:15:47):**  And so no surprise, people go to McDonald's and they buy processed food and they buy cheap  
**[0:15:51-0:15:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:15:51):**  food because that's what they can afford for their families.  
**[0:15:54-0:15:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:15:54):**  And so and again, that's the underinvestment.  
**[0:15:57-0:16:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:15:57):**  In the U.S. in particular, our health outcomes are far worse than any other developed country.  
**[0:16:03-0:16:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:16:03):**  And it's not because we spend less on health care.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:16:05):**  It's because we spend less on social care.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:16:07):**  We are underinvesting in the kinds of things, including food, that allow people to build  
**[0:16:13-0:16:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:16:13):**  healthy, productive lives and that we pay for it over here.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:16:15):**  But we're not talking about the fact that those two things are connected.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:16:18):**  And that's where we really have to shift.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:16:20):**  And in terms of food quality, as this revolution happens, where health care dollars, every  
**[0:16:27-0:16:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:16:27):**  insurer, every hospital is going to start paying for food as part of care because the  
**[0:16:32-0:16:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:16:32):**  bottom line is it works.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:16:33):**  Do you have an example of that?  
**[0:16:35-0:16:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:16:35):**  Because I know you're working on a number of them in California, like this discussion  
**[0:16:39-0:16:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:16:39):**  on seven dollar fifty and seven dollar fifty nine or forty nine to get it down just an  
**[0:16:44-0:16:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:16:44):**  inch cheaper there is really not very productive because you pay for it down the line because  
**[0:16:48-0:16:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:16:48):**  somebody gets back to the hospital 10 days later, which is extremely expensive.  
**[0:16:52-0:16:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:16:52):**  So you've been showing at your you and colleagues and other people in the space have been showing  
**[0:16:57-0:16:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:16:57):**  the absurdity of that system.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:16:59):**  Can you show an example of how you're trying to change the policy and getting the food  
**[0:17:02-0:17:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:17:02):**  not as a nice added benefit to have, like let's spend a bit of our community dollars  
**[0:17:07-0:17:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:17:07):**  on that, but actually as a part of your treatment?  
**[0:17:10-0:17:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:17:10):**  Because at the end of the day, it is either before or after an operation, but you need  
**[0:17:13-0:17:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:17:13):**  to eat well.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:17:14):**  What are you working on that specific to change that and showing it's actually way cheaper  
**[0:17:18-0:17:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:17:18):**  and way more affordable and way better for everybody involved.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:17:22):**  But let's start with the cheaper part or with the better part.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:17:25):**  What's some exciting stuff?  
**[0:17:26-0:17:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:17:26):**  Because you are part of some very interesting research there.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:17:30):**  Yeah, there's about six or seven published peer reviewed research studies in the US around  
**[0:17:35-0:17:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:17:35):**  medically tailored meals.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:17:37):**  Most of them were one for nonprofit organization in one community.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:17:42):**  Some of them are retrospective studies, some of their prospective studies, pretty much  
**[0:17:46-0:17:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:17:46):**  consistently they show that there's about a 16 to 20% net savings on the healthcare  
**[0:17:54-0:17:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:17:54):**  cost side when you provide a medically tailored meal intervention.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:17:58):**  Very general, lower readmissions, more likely to be discharged to home, better medication  
**[0:18:03-0:18:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:18:03):**  adherence, like a whole bunch of different things.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:18:06):**  So one of the challenges that I was finding as I was talking to healthcare providers is  
**[0:18:10-0:18:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:18:10):**  they were all saying, well, that's so great that that happened in Philadelphia, but how  
**[0:18:15-0:18:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:18:15):**  do I know what happened here?  
**[0:18:16-0:18:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:18:16):**  So there was a limit to like what those studies should show.  
**[0:18:19-0:18:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:18:19):**  So I was able with our state Senator in California and a group of colleague organizations in  
**[0:18:25-0:18:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:18:25):**  the state to get California to find the first in the country statewide pilot of medically  
**[0:18:31-0:18:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:18:31):**  tailored meals in the Medicaid system, which is our low income healthcare system.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:18:36):**  So these are all patients that are very low income and they all have congestive heart  
**[0:18:39-0:18:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:18:39):**  failure, which is it's the most likely readmission.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:18:43):**  So congestive heart failure patients are more likely to be readmitted to the hospital within  
**[0:18:48-0:18:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:18:48):**  30 days or 90 days than any other diagnoses.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:18:51):**  It's because of the nutrition impacts of the disease.  
**[0:18:55-0:19:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:18:55):**  So if you were eating a high sodium diet, which is very likely if you're poor and especially  
**[0:19:00-0:19:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:19:00):**  if you don't have anyone to cook for you, then your sodium levels go up.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:19:04):**  It puts pressure on your heart.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:19:05):**  You end up back in the hospital.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:19:07):**  So we've been doing this study for three years.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:19:09):**  We have one more year to go and we don't have data in the, there will be a full evaluation  
**[0:19:15-0:19:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:19:15):**  in 2022 in the Medi-Cal claims database, but we are showing dramatically reduced readmission  
**[0:19:22-0:19:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:19:22):**  rates for people who are getting the intervention.  
**[0:19:25-0:19:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:19:25):**  We're also now doing a large scale randomized controlled trial with Kaiser Permanente, which  
**[0:19:30-0:19:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:19:30):**  is a national healthcare system that uniquely has both, is both an insurer and a provider.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:19:36):**  So they have very detailed data on their members and are able to really do a lot of analysis.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:19:41):**  They have a very, very strong in-house evaluation team.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:19:44):**  So there's four studies happening right now.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:19:46):**  The one that we're doing is congestive heart failure, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:19:51):**  There are patients who are being discharged.  
**[0:19:54-0:20:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:19:54):**  They're comparing Kaiser's usual standard of care with 10 weeks of meals for everyone  
**[0:20:00-0:20:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:20:00):**  in the family with 10 weeks of meals for everyone in the family, plus support from a registered  
**[0:20:06-0:20:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:20:06):**  dietician around like health coaching and nutrition education.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:20:11):**  And we expect from all the existing data that that's going to show very dramatic results.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:20:16):**  And as a result already, Kaiser is planning in 2021 to provide medically tailored meals  
**[0:20:24-0:20:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:20:24):**  for seniors with congestive heart failure, which is possible because in 2020, the Medicare  
**[0:20:32-0:20:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:20:32):**  system in the US had made some changes that will allow medically tailored meals to be  
**[0:20:36-0:20:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:20:36):**  a covered benefit if you believe it will prevent another cost essentially.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:20:42):**  And that's what we're driving to now in California is building into the Medicaid system that  
**[0:20:47-0:20:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:20:47):**  you can provide home delivered and medically tailored meals in a number of different cases  
**[0:20:52-0:20:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:20:52):**  because it will prevent the cost of a readmission or an emergency department visit.  
**[0:20:56-0:20:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:20:56):**  So that's the cost.  
**[0:20:58-0:20:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:20:58):**  There's really good data.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:20:59):**  And I'll just say, literally every major insurer in the US is active in this space right now.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:21:06):**  They're doing pilots.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:21:07):**  So what has changed?  
**[0:21:08-0:21:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:21:08):**  Why is that now we're talking 2020 compared to when you started 2007?  
**[0:21:13-0:21:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:21:13):**  Why suddenly food and let's talk about soil in a minute, but let's say food as medicine,  
**[0:21:18-0:21:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:21:18):**  you have it in your email signature.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:21:20):**  Like why suddenly that sort of shifted?  
**[0:21:23-0:21:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:21:23):**  Do you have a hunch?  
**[0:21:24-0:21:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:21:24):**  But maybe we don't know.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:21:25):**  But it seems to have shifted the last few years.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:21:28):**  Yes, I think there's two things that have happened.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:21:31):**  One is there is a growing understanding that we are not going to drive improvement in health  
**[0:21:39-0:21:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:21:39):**  outcomes or control healthcare costs without addressing what are called social determinants  
**[0:21:45-0:21:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:21:45):**  of health.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:21:46):**  There's a real understanding out.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:21:47):**  So the data basically shows that only 20% of your health is driven by what happens in  
**[0:21:54-0:21:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:21:54):**  a clinical healthcare setting.  
**[0:21:56-0:21:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:21:56):**  Wow.  
**[0:21:57-0:21:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:21:57):**  And that's where we invest all our money.  
**[0:21:58-0:22:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:21:58):**  Like all MedTech or everybody is going after the latest XYZ, etc.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:22:05):**  30% are the choices you and I make every day.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:22:08):**  Eating well, stress management, not smoking, exercise, not overusing drugs.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:22:14):**  Like all of those lifestyle changes, that's 30%.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:22:19):**  But 40% are what are called the social determinants of health.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:22:23):**  Those are the things that impact people's ability to make those healthy choices.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:22:27):**  So if you're poor, you live in an area where it's not safe to walk outside, you can't access  
**[0:22:32-0:22:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:22:32):**  healthy food, you don't have access to transportation.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:22:35):**  All of those things are 40%.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:22:38):**  So 30% are choices, 40% of things that limit choices.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:22:41):**  And then 10%, sorry, now I'm curious.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:22:43):**  10% is like environmental factors, genetics and environmental factors.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:22:48):**  So I think what's happened is as that realization has grown, healthcare has been pressed to  
**[0:22:54-0:22:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:22:54):**  realize that they have to now think about those things that happen outside the doctor's  
**[0:22:59-0:23:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:22:59):**  office.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:23:00):**  And when you look at that space, when you look at housing, financial literacy, financial  
**[0:23:07-0:23:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:23:07):**  empowerment, food, food becomes the easiest and the cheapest thing to take on.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:23:13):**  It's way easier to talk about food security and nutrition security than changing housing  
**[0:23:18-0:23:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:23:18):**  policy.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:23:19):**  And getting more people, well, that's a big thing to take on.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:23:24):**  Improving wages, that's a big thing to take on.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:23:26):**  Food is cheap and it's fast.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:23:28):**  And so I think it's driven this realization that Humana, who's an insurer in the Southeast,  
**[0:23:35-0:23:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:23:35):**  I heard this at a conference a couple of years ago and it really struck me.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:23:38):**  They realized that for Medicaid patients, Medicaid patients were 29% more likely to  
**[0:23:46-0:23:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:23:46):**  end up in the emergency department the last week of the month.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:23:49):**  Why?  
**[0:23:50-0:23:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:23:50):**  Because they run out of food.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:23:52):**  Most of them are diabetic or pre-diabetic.  
**[0:23:54-0:23:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:23:54):**  They continue to take their medication, but they're skipping meals.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:23:58):**  And that has them become, I'm not going to remember the term right now, but anyway, that  
**[0:24:01-0:24:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:24:01):**  causes a problem.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:24:02):**  They end up in the emergency room.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:24:04):**  So now they're testing, they're doing randomized controlled trials around a food security intervention.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:24:09):**  Way cheaper to provide food for that last week of the month than to have all those patients  
**[0:24:13-0:24:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:24:13):**  end up in the emergency department.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:24:15):**  So these kinds of realizations are happening and we've been able to, again, drive some  
**[0:24:20-0:24:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:24:20):**  change in Medicare where Medicare can now cover meals.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:24:24):**  Not many plans offered meals in the first year, but now there's peer pressure among  
**[0:24:28-0:24:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:24:28):**  the plans.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:24:29):**  And in the US now, you can see ads on like TV where they're saying new Medicare benefits,  
**[0:24:36-0:24:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:24:36):**  home delivered meals.  
**[0:24:37-0:24:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:24:37):**  Like I never in my wildest dreams thought that would have happened 10 years ago.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:24:41):**  But is it going to be then like, is there going to be peer pressure on the quality as  
**[0:24:45-0:24:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:24:45):**  well?  
**[0:24:46-0:24:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:24:46):**  Like tasty meals, healthy meals?  
**[0:24:47-0:24:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:24:47):**  Well, that's the next stage.  
**[0:24:49-0:24:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:24:49):**  And that's part of the work that we're trying to do at Ceres is to drive conversations among  
**[0:24:54-0:24:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:24:54):**  our colleagues and among healthcare to hold a different standard.  
**[0:24:58-0:25:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:24:58):**  And I'll use Kaiser as an example, cause I'm having a lot of conversations with them.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:25:03):**  They are in Northern California.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:25:05):**  They committed to a hundred percent sustainably sourced food at all of their facilities by  
**[0:25:11-0:25:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:25:11):**  2025.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:25:12):**  And they're actively working on that.  
**[0:25:14-0:25:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:25:14):**  Which is a massive buyer.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:25:15):**  That's great.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:25:16):**  For people working in this space, these are, if you can supply these, huge.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:25:22):**  That's massive buyer.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:25:23):**  And so they're driving food system change in California because of that's awesome.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:25:27):**  But then they go and offer their medically tailored meals.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:25:31):**  They're contracting with that for-profit provider who does not represent those values at all.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:25:37):**  And I've said directly to them, you have to stop purchasing from them.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:25:41):**  That company does not align with your own values in this space.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:25:46):**  And if you invest in a community-based organization like Ceres for a little bit more, you are  
**[0:25:52-0:25:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:25:52):**  driving layers of community health benefit.  
**[0:25:54-0:25:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:25:54):**  So we educate young people.  
**[0:25:57-0:26:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:25:57):**  78% of our adult volunteers improve their eating habits.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:26:00):**  We don't do any programming to them.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:26:02):**  It's just because they're involved.  
**[0:26:04-0:26:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:26:04):**  We're educating the whole community about food and health.  
**[0:26:06-0:26:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:26:06):**  We buy locally, we buy organically.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:26:09):**  So when you invest your dollars in us, you're buying a lot of things.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:26:13):**  When you invest your dollars in 775 drop ship from Iowa, that is completely out of integrity  
**[0:26:20-0:26:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:26:20):**  with your values.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:26:21):**  Like we have to be able to say that stuff out loud and call people on it and raise their  
**[0:26:25-0:26:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:26:25):**  consciousness.  
**[0:26:26-0:26:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:26:26):**  It's a consciousness issue.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:26:27):**  They just don't think about it.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:26:28):**  They're in a mode of what's the cheapest solution.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:26:31):**  Like I'm in a, what's the cheapest solution.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:26:34):**  And so we have to start raising those issues and saying, you have to think beyond those  
**[0:26:38-0:26:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:26:38):**  immediate dollars.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:26:39):**  What is it you're buying with your money and what is in alignment with your values?  
**[0:26:43-0:26:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:26:43):**  What do you want to model for your peers?  
**[0:26:46-0:26:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:26:46):**  Like, you know, Kaiser, it's like, you have the ability to model something for your peers.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:26:50):**  Are you willing to do that or not?  
**[0:26:51-0:26:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:26:51):**  And then if we're at, I would say that level of discussion, like, look, that you get what  
**[0:26:56-0:27:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:26:56):**  you pay for in terms of food, in terms of quality, et cetera.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:27:00):**  How do you imagine shifting that conversation?  
**[0:27:03-0:27:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:27:03):**  Because you're having this conversation, you're speaking with Dan, et cetera, on bringing  
**[0:27:07-0:27:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:27:07):**  in soil and going beyond organic and beyond that.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:27:12):**  Like how do we get soil health into that discussion?  
**[0:27:14-0:27:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:27:14):**  Because that seems like a huge other leap like from, okay, we're going to pay a bit  
**[0:27:18-0:27:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:27:18):**  more.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:27:19):**  Okay.  
**[0:27:20-0:27:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:27:20):**  We're not going to ship it from wherever we're going to invest here.  
**[0:27:21-0:27:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:27:21):**  Do you see that?  
**[0:27:22-0:27:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:27:22):**  Or is that sort of a logical next step to get soil health into discussion really slow  
**[0:27:26-0:27:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:27:26):**  show literally all the layers that are involved in our food system?  
**[0:27:29-0:27:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:27:29):**  I don't think it's a leap at all.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:27:31):**  I think it's just an extension of the conversation, right?  
**[0:27:34-0:27:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:27:34):**  Because if you're, you know, Kaiser saying they have this value around, we're going to  
**[0:27:38-0:27:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:27:38):**  source sustainably.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:27:39):**  Okay.  
**[0:27:40-0:27:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:27:40):**  Like what's behind that?  
**[0:27:41-0:27:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:27:41):**  What's behind that is they're thinking about the environmental impacts, right?  
**[0:27:45-0:27:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:27:45):**  They're thinking about, like for example, they care about, they've just invested in  
**[0:27:49-0:27:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:27:49):**  a new facility that makes their patient meals.  
**[0:27:53-0:27:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:27:53):**  And one of the things they're really excited about is that food facility is hiring people,  
**[0:27:58-0:28:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:27:58):**  immigrants and people coming out of the justice system and doing job training.  
**[0:28:02-0:28:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:28:02):**  So they're trying to think about all these, they know that health means people need to  
**[0:28:07-0:28:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:28:07):**  be economically healthy.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:28:08):**  People need to be, the environment needs to be healthy.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:28:10):**  We need healthy water.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:28:11):**  Like they know that.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:28:13):**  And it's just about taking them down that path where they understand the connections  
**[0:28:18-0:28:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:28:18):**  between the decisions they're making and those outcomes.  
**[0:28:20-0:28:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:28:20):**  So if you're buying organically and you're buying locally and you're buying from like  
**[0:28:25-0:28:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:28:25):**  big conversation in California now is BIPOC owned farms, like farms owned by people of  
**[0:28:30-0:28:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:28:30):**  color, farms owned by immigrant communities, like local small farms, small, we got to support  
**[0:28:35-0:28:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:28:35):**  small farmers.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:28:36):**  Like those conversations are all happening and it's about connecting the dots and thinking  
**[0:28:41-0:28:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:28:41):**  about when you buy from an organization like Ceres, here's the farmers that we're supporting.  
**[0:28:47-0:28:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:28:47):**  Here's their soil policies.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:28:50):**  Here's how that supports their welfare policies.  
**[0:28:54-0:28:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:28:54):**  Addressing climate change, which is going to affect health.  
**[0:28:57-0:29:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:28:57):**  It's like, it's all connected, but you have to make the connections for people.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:29:01):**  You have to take them through that process.  
**[0:29:03-0:29:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:29:03):**  And, but again, you know, I use Kaiser because they are thinking in the right way, like as  
**[0:29:10-0:29:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:29:10):**  an organization, they're inclined to these conversations.  
**[0:29:14-0:29:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:29:14):**  And so, you know, if we can get someone like them.  
**[0:29:17-0:29:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:29:17):**  And they're big just for people to understand like what's their size in terms of like, just  
**[0:29:22-0:29:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:29:22):**  to, for people that never heard of the word.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:29:25):**  They, 95 million members, I think in the U S something like that.  
**[0:29:30-0:29:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:29:30):**  That's massive.  
**[0:29:31-0:29:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:29:31):**  Yeah.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:29:32):**  If they are shifting, the rest will follow if they see results.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:29:34):**  Well, Washington, so they're in Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada, Hawaii, you know,  
**[0:29:40-0:29:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:29:40):**  maybe eight or 10 States.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:29:43):**  And they're, they've always been a real leader in, you know, partly because they have the  
**[0:29:48-0:29:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:29:48):**  insurance side and the healthcare side.  
**[0:29:50-0:29:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:29:50):**  They've always connected.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:29:51):**  They see the costs.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:29:52):**  They see the costs, right?  
**[0:29:53-0:29:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:29:53):**  They see the costs.  
**[0:29:55-0:30:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:29:55):**  And so they're not disconnected and they've always been very data driven and understanding  
**[0:30:00-0:30:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:30:00):**  what builds value.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:30:02):**  And you know, they've just developed a whole national strategy called food for life.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:30:05):**  They're doing a lot of work around food and nutrition insecurity right now with their  
**[0:30:09-0:30:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:30:09):**  members and they're doing a lot of really good things.  
**[0:30:12-0:30:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:30:12):**  But even there, like it only goes so far.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:30:16):**  And that's where our job, I think as advocates is to push them to go farther and to explain  
**[0:30:23-0:30:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:30:23):**  to them what's missing from their thinking and their decision making process.  
**[0:30:28-0:30:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:30:28):**  And I think that's the work right now.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:30:29):**  As I said, like there is a revolution happening in this country.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:30:33):**  There's so much momentum right now around food as medicine.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:30:36):**  And I'm part of the food lab at Google and I was at a meeting there a couple of years  
**[0:30:40-0:30:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:30:40):**  ago and I suddenly like had this light bulb moment where I realized like this is all happening  
**[0:30:46-0:30:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:30:46):**  and it's happening really fast and everyone's getting in and there's like all this momentum  
**[0:30:51-0:30:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:30:51):**  happening but the food quality and the environmental impact piece was like completely missing from  
**[0:30:57-0:30:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:30:57):**  the equation.  
**[0:30:59-0:31:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:30:59):**  And that was terrifying because it's such a huge missed opportunity.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:31:03):**  If we don't connect the dots now and we get those decisions to be made and those investments  
**[0:31:09-0:31:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:31:09):**  to be made in a way that also supports a healthy food system and a healthy environment and  
**[0:31:14-0:31:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:31:14):**  healthy soil, like we have so missed an opportunity.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:31:17):**  And that has really driven me for the last couple of years.  
**[0:31:20-0:31:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:31:20):**  And for the people working in the regenerative ag and food space, how can they be part of  
**[0:31:25-0:31:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:31:25):**  these discussions?  
**[0:31:26-0:31:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:31:26):**  Like what's the role for the farmer approach using regenerative practices, but also the  
**[0:31:30-0:31:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:31:30):**  food companies?  
**[0:31:31-0:31:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:31:31):**  Like there's a lot happening, but mostly it's not part of this system.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:31:35):**  Mostly it's not part of medical tailored meals.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:31:38):**  What can listeners of the podcast do also if you're in other countries?  
**[0:31:41-0:31:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:31:41):**  Like what is needed to make sure soil is part of this revolution that is happening in terms  
**[0:31:45-0:31:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:31:45):**  of food as medicine?  
**[0:31:46-0:31:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:31:46):**  I think what's really important and what I say a lot when I'm speaking is that, you know,  
**[0:31:52-0:31:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:31:52):**  if you're on the healthcare side, you're thinking about chronic disease, you're thinking about  
**[0:31:58-0:32:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:31:58):**  healthcare costs, maybe you're thinking about nutrition and security.  
**[0:32:02-0:32:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:32:02):**  If you're on the farming side of this, you're thinking about the food system and regenerative  
**[0:32:07-0:32:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:32:07):**  soil and climate change and that side of the equation.  
**[0:32:10-0:32:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:32:10):**  We have to start, no matter what side of that equation you're on, you have to become facile  
**[0:32:17-0:32:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:32:17):**  and understand the other side of the equation.  
**[0:32:19-0:32:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:32:19):**  And we all have to start talking about that full circle and not just our piece of it.  
**[0:32:25-0:32:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:32:25):**  That's I think what the big opportunity is.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:32:27):**  And because as I said to you before we started recording, food is medicine.  
**[0:32:33-0:32:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:32:33):**  Food is also poison.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:32:34):**  It's about the food choices you're making and the quality of that food.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:32:39):**  You know, food is driving chronic disease and food can prevent chronic disease.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:32:43):**  It's both sides of that are true and we have to take responsibility.  
**[0:32:47-0:32:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:32:47):**  You know, and I challenge my colleagues in the medically tailored meal space who are  
**[0:32:50-0:32:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:32:50):**  always throwing around food as medicine.  
**[0:32:53-0:32:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:32:53):**  And frankly, some of them are still serving margarine.  
**[0:32:55-0:32:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:32:55):**  I mean, it's like, and they talk about quality.  
**[0:32:58-0:33:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:32:58):**  I'm like, we've got to talk about what we mean when we use the word quality.  
**[0:33:01-0:33:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:33:01):**  It's not just the nutrients in that meal.  
**[0:33:03-0:33:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:33:03):**  For us, like I love healthcare without harms, environmental nutrition framework, which is  
**[0:33:08-0:33:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:33:08):**  nutrition has to mean the health of the whole system, not just the nutrition in the food.  
**[0:33:15-0:33:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:33:15):**  And as you know, the nutrition in the soil also drives the nutrition in the food.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:33:19):**  Like all carrots are not created equal.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:33:21):**  So it all matters.  
**[0:33:23-0:33:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:33:23):**  And I think partly the conversations have happened in such like little arcs of the circle,  
**[0:33:29-0:33:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:33:29):**  but not the whole circle at once.  
**[0:33:30-0:33:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:33:30):**  And that's what I think the opportunity is.  
**[0:33:33-0:33:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:33:33):**  And for everyone to understand that we have to be advocates for all of it.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:33:37):**  We can't just be advocates for part of it.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:33:39):**  Like if you care about all this and you're a regenerative farmer to understand what's  
**[0:33:45-0:33:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:33:45):**  driving hunger and how hunger is being solved in your community and finding a way to be  
**[0:33:50-0:33:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:33:50):**  part of that solution and doing it in a way which might not be the farmer's market or  
**[0:33:54-0:33:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:33:54):**  your current sales channels, right?  
**[0:33:56-0:34:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:33:56):**  The farmer's market and having a discounted CSA box, becoming a snap authorized retailer  
**[0:34:02-0:34:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:34:02):**  and offering a discount for low income people to buy your bottle.  
**[0:34:05-0:34:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:34:05):**  Like there's some, you know, connecting with your local hospital and saying, could we have  
**[0:34:09-0:34:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:34:09):**  a farmer's market here or the USDA now is funding produce prescription models, right?  
**[0:34:16-0:34:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:34:16):**  It's called the GusNIP program, Gus Schumacher nutrition incentive program.  
**[0:34:20-0:34:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:34:20):**  There's a lot of dollars available for people to develop produce prescription models with  
**[0:34:25-0:34:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:34:25):**  their local community health centers and then bringing really high quality food to that  
**[0:34:29-0:34:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:34:29):**  and building those reimbursement mechanisms.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:34:31):**  Like there's a lot of solutions in there.  
**[0:34:34-0:34:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:34:34):**  So basically the biggest impact I'm realizing now, took an hour, obviously of nutrient dense  
**[0:34:40-0:34:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:34:40):**  food or food as medicine is obviously with the people that are not near that at all at  
**[0:34:46-0:34:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:34:46):**  the moment.  
**[0:34:47-0:34:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:34:47):**  Like if you are on a fast food diet coming out of a hospital because of very serious  
**[0:34:51-0:34:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:34:51):**  illness, that's where it hits the hardest.  
**[0:34:54-0:35:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:34:54):**  Like if you then go on 12 weeks of super organic, super tasty, low in salt, low in everything  
**[0:35:00-0:35:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:35:00):**  that you don't need and high in everything you do need, that's the biggest potential  
**[0:35:03-0:35:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:35:03):**  benefit.  
**[0:35:04-0:35:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:35:04):**  It's not for the people that already go to the farmer's market and might switch from  
**[0:35:08-0:35:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:35:08):**  some organic to deep soil building.  
**[0:35:11-0:35:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:35:11):**  That's a very marginal, it's an interesting improvement.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:35:14):**  We see the differences in carrots, et cetera, but it's not where the biggest impact lies.  
**[0:35:18-0:35:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:35:18):**  The biggest impact lies on the other side of the equation where the normal meal is McDonald's.  
**[0:35:23-0:35:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:35:23):**  Yeah.  
**[0:35:24-0:35:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:35:24):**  Thank you for saying that.  
**[0:35:25-0:35:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:35:25):**  I mean, it's interesting because I am part of the food lab at Google and there's a lot  
**[0:35:29-0:35:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:35:29):**  of conversation there about personalized medicine and like all of these kinds of things.  
**[0:35:34-0:35:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:35:34):**  I'm really interested in the 30% of Americans that can't access a basically healthy diet.  
**[0:35:40-0:35:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:35:40):**  I mean, that's what's driving chronic disease.  
**[0:35:42-0:35:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:35:42):**  When you look at an equity standpoint, that's where we need to be focusing.  
**[0:35:45-0:35:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:35:45):**  That's why we're really interested in making change in the Medicaid system, frankly, because  
**[0:35:50-0:35:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:35:50):**  that's the population that has the highest chronic disease burden, has the least access.  
**[0:35:56-0:35:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:35:56):**  I feel really strongly that we need to focus there and that's where we can make the biggest  
**[0:35:59-0:36:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:35:59):**  difference.  
**[0:36:00-0:36:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:36:00):**  I appreciate you pointing that out.  
**[0:36:02-0:36:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:36:02):**  It's about bringing organic, there's always been a conversation for years about organic  
**[0:36:08-0:36:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:36:08):**  being elitist and more expensive.  
**[0:36:10-0:36:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:36:10):**  It's like-  
**[0:36:11-0:36:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:36:11):**  Whole paycheck.  
**[0:36:12-0:36:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:36:12):**  Organic needs to be for everyone and we need to make it.  
**[0:36:16-0:36:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:36:16):**  It's got to be a commitment to the highest quality food for every American, not just  
**[0:36:20-0:36:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:36:20):**  for the people who can afford it.  
**[0:36:22-0:36:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:36:22):**  That's why driving change in healthcare policy is so important because we can radically expand  
**[0:36:29-0:36:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:36:29):**  access to very healthy food because healthcare has so many dollars to spend and there's already  
**[0:36:34-0:36:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:36:34):**  so much evidence that investing in food can drive improved outcomes and save costs.  
**[0:36:40-0:36:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:36:40):**  So it's a win, win, win, win, win, win.  
**[0:36:42-0:36:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:36:42):**  Yeah.  
**[0:36:43-0:36:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:36:43):**  I don't remember the exact data.  
**[0:36:44-0:36:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:36:44):**  I think it used to be Americans spent 18%, one eight on food and 9% or so on healthcare  
**[0:36:50-0:36:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:36:50):**  and it switched completely in the last, I'm saying 20, 30 years.  
**[0:36:53-0:36:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:36:53):**  I don't remember the exact date, but now it's 18 and nine the other way around.  
**[0:36:56-0:36:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:36:56):**  And yeah, we see the results of that.  
**[0:36:58-0:36:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:36:58):**  Let's say, I want to be conscious of your time.  
**[0:36:59-0:37:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:36:59):**  I know you have another call to go to.  
**[0:37:00-0:37:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:37:00):**  I have one last question.  
**[0:37:02-0:37:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:37:02):**  If you could wave a magic wand and you have one thing, I feel like we just started this  
**[0:37:05-0:37:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:37:05):**  discussion, but we'll come back another time.  
**[0:37:08-0:37:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:37:08):**  If you could wave a magic wand and have one thing change in the food and egg space, what  
**[0:37:12-0:37:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:37:12):**  would that be?  
**[0:37:13-0:37:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:37:13):**  I mean, for me, the driver is that Medicaid was covering food.  
**[0:37:18-0:37:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:37:18):**  That everyone with chronic disease was getting a food prescription, like from pre-diabetes  
**[0:37:24-0:37:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:37:24):**  or kids with obesity all the way through people who are being hospitalized.  
**[0:37:27-0:37:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:37:27):**  I imagine healthy food, not just general food.  
**[0:37:30-0:37:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:37:30):**  Healthy food.  
**[0:37:31-0:37:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:37:31):**  Yeah.  
**[0:37:32-0:37:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:37:32):**  Healthy food.  
**[0:37:33-0:37:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:37:33):**  And I think the other one is that we're willing to pay for food quality instead of the conversation  
**[0:37:39-0:37:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:37:39):**  that the, you know, trying to get food as cheaply as possible, which is such a vintage,  
**[0:37:43-0:37:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:37:43):**  such a driver in the US and continues to be a conversation on the healthcare side that  
**[0:37:47-0:37:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:37:47):**  we understand that good food is worth paying for and that we're willing to pay for it.  
**[0:37:52-0:37:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:37:52):**  In the grand scheme of things, it's much cheaper, but because of all the externalized costs,  
**[0:37:56-0:37:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:37:56):**  et cetera, somebody is picking up the bill.  
**[0:37:58-0:38:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:37:58):**  That's probably three, four times over, maybe 10 times over.  
**[0:38:01-0:38:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:38:01):**  But at the moment, that little price tag seems very cheap and it's not.  
**[0:38:05-0:38:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:38:05):**  It's poison in many cases.  
**[0:38:06-0:38:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:38:06):**  I think that's a very strong way of, and a very good way of ending this conversation.  
**[0:38:10-0:38:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:38:10):**  I want to thank you, Katherine, so much for your time.  
**[0:38:12-0:38:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:38:12):**  I know you have a very busy schedule and I think at least I, but I'm pretty sure most  
**[0:38:18-0:38:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:38:18):**  of the listeners learned a lot about a side of the food system we hardly ever talk to,  
**[0:38:21-0:38:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:38:21):**  but it's extremely and extremely important and underfunded and underinvested and underworked  
**[0:38:26-0:38:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:38:26):**  at unfortunately, because it's such a, there are so many wins to win there basically.  
**[0:38:31-0:38:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:38:31):**  Thank you so much.  
**[0:38:32-0:38:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:38:32):**  It was a real pleasure and I look forward to continuing the conversation at some point.  
**[0:38:36-0:38:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:38:36):**  Thanks.

**[0:41:44-0:41:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:41:44):**  We're gonna look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:41:49-0:41:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cathryn-couch#t=0:41:49):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to
